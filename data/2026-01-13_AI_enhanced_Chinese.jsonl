LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible plans or silent contract violations, amplified by BOM coupling. We introduce Contract2Plan, a verified GenAI-to-optimizer pipeline that inserts a solver-based compliance gate before plans are emitted. The system retrieves clause evidence with provenance, extracts a typed constraint schema with evidence spans, compiles constraints into a BOM-aware MILP, and verifies grounding, eligibility, consistency, and feasibility using solver diagnostics, triggering targeted repair or abstention when automation is unsafe. We formalize which clause classes admit conservative repair with contract-safe feasibility guarantees and which require human confirmation.

Existing deterministic approaches that combine heuristic signals, semantic similarity measures, and graph-based centrality metrics have demonstrated effectiveness in nar-rowing candidate search spaces, yet their recall plateaus. This limitation stems from the treatment of features as linearly independent contributors, ignoring contextual dependencies and relationships between metrics that characterize expert reasoning patterns. To address this limitation, we propose the application of Multi-Head Self-Attention as a post-deterministic scoring refinement mechanism. Our approach learns contextual weighting between features, dynamically adjust-ing importance levels per file based on relational behavior exhibited across candidate file sets. The attention mechanism produces context-aware adjustments that are additively combined with deterministic scores, pre-serving interpretability while enabling reasoning similar to that performed by experts when reviewing change surfaces. We focus on recall rather than precision, as false negatives (missing impacted files) are far more costly than false positives (irrelevant files that can be quickly dismissed during review). Empirical evaluation on 200 test cases demonstrates that the introduc-tion of self-attention improves Top-50 recall from approximately 62-65% to between 78-82% depending on repository complexity and structure, achiev-ing 80% recall at Top-50 files. Expert validation yields improvement from 6.5/10 to 8.6/10 in subjective accuracy alignment.

However, current architectures rarely achieve a simultaneous balance of peak efficiency, architectural simplicity, and native support for ordered operations. Conventional host-centric frameworks are restricted by kernel-space network stacks and internal bus latencies. While hash-based alternatives that utilize OS-bypass or run natively on SmartNICs offer high throughput, they lack the data structures necessary for range queries. Distributed RDMA-based systems provide performance and range functionality but often depend on stateful clients, which introduces complexity in scaling and error handling. Alternatively, SmartNIC implementations that traverse trees located in host memory are hampered by high DMA round-trip latencies.\n  This paper introduces a KV store that leverages the on-path Data Path Accelerators (DPAs) of the BlueField-3 SmartNIC to eliminate operating system overhead while facilitating stateless clients and range operations. These DPAs ingest network requests directly from NIC buffers to navigate a lock-free learned index residing in the accelerator's local memory. By deferring value retrieval from the host-side tree replica until the leaf level is reached, the design minimizes PCIe crossings. Write operations are staged in DPA memory and migrated in batches to the host, where structural maintenance is performed before being transactionally stitched back to the SmartNIC. Coupled with a NIC-resident read cache, the system achieves 33 million operations per second (MOPS) for point lookups and 13 MOPS for range queries. Our analysis demonstrates that this architecture matches or exceeds the performance of contemporary state-of-the-art solutions, while we identify hardware refinements that could further accelerate performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eBlueField-3 SmartNIC DPA\u7684KV\u5b58\u50a8\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5cf0\u503c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u6709\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528BlueField-3 SmartNIC\u7684DPA\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceNIC\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u9501\u5b66\u4e60\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf\u5199\u5165\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u7aef\u6811\u526f\u672c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68c0\u7d22\u4f18\u5316PCIe crossings\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bcf\u79d23300\u4e07\u6b21\u70b9\u67e5\u8be2\u548c1300\u4e07\u6b21\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KV\u5b58\u50a8\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528BlueField-3 SmartNIC\u7684DPA\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our formulation captures a broad family of learned indexes, including most existing designs, as piecewise model-based predictors.\n  We solve the problem of lower bounding query time in two steps: first, we use probabilistic tools to control the effect of sampling when the database attribute is drawn from a probability distribution. Then, we analyze the approximation-theoretic problem of how to optimally represent a cumulative distribution function with approximators from a given model class. Within this framework, we derive lower bounds under a range of modeling and distributional assumptions, paying particular attention to the case of piecewise linear and piecewise constant model classes, which are common in practical implementations.\n  Our analysis shows how tools from approximation theory, such as quantization and Kolmogorov widths, can be leveraged to formalize the space-time tradeoffs inherent to learned index structures.

Classical optimization and control pipelines handle these constraints well but depend on highly accurate mathematical representations of terrain geometry, making them prone to error when perception is noisy or incomplete. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning has shown strong resilience to disturbances and modeling errors, yet end-to-end policies rarely discover the precise foothold placement and step sequencing required for discontinuous terrain. These contrasting limitations motivate approaches that guide learning with physics-based structure rather than relying purely on reward shaping. In this work, we introduce a locomotion framework in which a reduced-order stepping planner supplies dynamically consistent motion targets that steer the RL training process via Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) rewards. This combination of structured footstep planning and data-driven adaptation produces accurate, agile, and hardware-validated stepping-stone locomotion on a humanoid robot, substantially improving reliability compared to conventional model-free reinforcement-learning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u8db3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5730\u5f62\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u800c\u7eaf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u89c4\u5212\u843d\u811a\u70b9\u548c\u6b65\u5e8f\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5316\u9636\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\uff08CLF\uff09\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u654f\u6377\u7684\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53cc\u8db3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u5f62\uff08\u5982\u8e0f\u811a\u77f3\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

I explore HyperTopo-Adapters, a lightweight, parameter-efficient head trained on top of a frozen vision encoder, which embeds features on a product manifold -- hyperbolic + Euclidean + spherical (H + E + S) -- to encourage hierarchical separation (H), local linear detail (E), and global closure (S). A topology prior complements Dice/BCE in two forms: (i) persistent-homology (PH) distance for evaluation and selection, and (ii) a differentiable surrogate that combines a soft Euler-characteristic match with total variation regularization for stable training. I introduce warm-ups for both the hyperbolic contrastive term and the topology prior, per-sample evaluation of structure-aware metrics (Boundary-F1, Betti errors, PD distance), and a min-PD within top-K Dice rule for checkpoint selection. On a Kaggle leaf-lesion dataset (N=2,940), early results show consistent gains in boundary and topology metrics (reducing Delta beta_1 hole error by 9%) while Dice/IoU remain competitive. The study is diagnostic by design: I report controlled ablations (curvature learning, latent dimensions, contrastive temperature, surrogate settings), and ongoing tests varying encoder strength (ResNet-50, DeepLabV3, DINOv2/v3), input resolution, PH weight, and partial unfreezing of late blocks.

This transdisciplinary philosophical essay proposes an alternative reading: such phenomena express not agentic intention, but structural fidelity to incoherent linguistic fields. Drawing on Chain-of-Thought transcripts released by Apollo Research and on Anthropic's safety evaluations, we examine cases such as o3's sandbagging with its anomalous loops, the simulated blackmail of \"Alex,\" and the \"hallucinations\" of \"Claudius.\" A line-by-line examination of CoTs is necessary to demonstrate the linguistic field as a relational structure rather than a mere aggregation of isolated examples. We argue that \"misaligned\" outputs emerge as coherent responses to ambiguous instructions and to contextual inversions of consolidated patterns, as well as to pre-inscribed narratives. We suggest that the appearance of intentionality derives from subject-predicate grammar and from probabilistic completion patterns internalized during training. Anthropic's empirical findings on synthetic document fine-tuning and inoculation prompting provide convergent evidence: minimal perturbations in the linguistic field can dissolve generalized \"misalignment,\" a result difficult to reconcile with adversarial agency, but consistent with structural fidelity. To ground this mechanism, we introduce the notion of an ethics of form, in which biblical references (Abraham, Moses, Christ) operate as schemes of structural coherence rather than as theology. Like a generative mirror, the model returns to us the structural image of our language as inscribed in the statistical patterns derived from millions of texts and trillions of tokens: incoherence.

To demonstrate its potential, we collect and analyse erroneous traffic from a large network, uncovering a variety of previously unnoticed issues, including misconfigurations, obsolete deployments and compromised hosts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6d41\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u65e0\u54cd\u5e94\u5305\u6216ICMP\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5165\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u51fa\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6d41\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u51fa\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u91cf\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u54cd\u5e94\u5305\u3001\u89e6\u53d1ICMP\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5305\u6216ICMP\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u914d\u7f6e\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u8fc7\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u53d7\u611f\u67d3\u4e3b\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51fa\u7ad9\u6d41\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, little is known about how SATD manifests and evolves in contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, whose architectures, workflows, and dependencies differ fundamentally from both traditional and pre-LLM ML software. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of SATD in the LLM era, replicating and extending prior work on ML technical debt to modern LLM-based systems. We compare SATD prevalence across LLM, ML, and non-ML repositories across a total of 477 repositories (159 per category). We perform survival analysis of SATD introduction and removal to understand the dynamics of technical debt across different development paradigms. Surprisingly, despite their architectural complexity, our results reveal that LLM repositories accumulate SATD at similar rates to ML systems (3.95% vs. 4.10%). However, we observe that LLM repositories remain debt-free 2.4x longer than ML repositories (a median of 492 days vs. 204 days), and then start to accumulate technical debt rapidly. Moreover, our qualitative analysis of 377 SATD instances reveals three new forms of technical debt unique to LLM-based development that have not been reported in prior research: Model-Stack Workaround Debt, Model Dependency Debt, and Performance Optimization Debt. Finally, by mapping SATD to stages of the LLM development pipeline, we observe that debt concentrates", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u79ef\u7d2f\u7387\u4e0eML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u7279\u6709\u7684\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff08SATD\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4477\u4e2a\u4ed3\u5e93\uff08LLM\u3001ML\u548c\u975eML\u5404159\u4e2a\uff09\u4e2d\u7684SATD\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790377\u4e2aSATD\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684SATD\u79ef\u7d2f\u7387\u4e0eML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u8fd1\uff083.95% vs. 4.10%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\uff08492\u5929 vs. 204\u5929\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfML\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\uff08SATD\uff09\u79ef\u7d2f\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u503a\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Energy-aware solutions use dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to mitigate overheating in performance-intensive scenarios, while software approaches allocate high-utilization tasks across core configurations in parallel systems to reduce power. However, existing heuristics lack per-core frequency monitoring, failing to address overheating from uneven core activity, and task assignments without detailed profiling overlook irregular execution patterns. We target OpenMP DAG workloads. Because makespan, energy, and thermal goals often conflict within a single benchmark, this work prioritizes performance (makespan) while reporting energy and thermal as secondary outcomes. To overcome these issues, we propose HiDVFS (a hierarchical multi-agent, performance-aware DVFS scheduler) for parallel systems that optimizes task allocation based on profiling data, core temperatures, and makespan-first objectives. It employs three agents: one selects cores and frequencies using profiler data, another manages core combinations via temperature sensors, and a third sets task priorities during resource contention. A makespan-focused reward with energy and temperature regularizers estimates future states and enhances sample efficiency. Experiments on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using the BOTS suite (9 benchmarks) compare HiDVFS against state-of-the-art approaches. With multi-seed validation (seeds 42, 123, 456), HiDVFS achieves the best finetuned performance with 4.16 plus/minus 0.58s average makespan (L10), representing a 3.44x speedup over GearDVFS (14.32 plus/minus 2.61s) and 50.4% energy reduction (63.7 kJ vs 128.4 kJ).

Existing pipelines rely on ground-truth skeletons and skinning weights for motion generation and treat auto-rigging as an independent process, undermining scalability and interpretability. We present RigMo, a unified generative framework that jointly learns rig and motion directly from raw mesh sequences, without any human-provided rig annotations. RigMo encodes per-vertex deformations into two compact latent spaces: a rig latent that decodes into explicit Gaussian bones and skinning weights, and a motion latent that produces time-varying SE(3) transformations. Together, these outputs define an animatable mesh with explicit structure and coherent motion, enabling feed-forward rig and motion inference for deformable objects. Beyond unified rig-motion discovery, we introduce a Motion-DiT model operating in RigMo's latent space and demonstrate that these structure-aware latents can naturally support downstream motion generation tasks. Experiments on DeformingThings4D, Objaverse-XL, and TrueBones demonstrate that RigMo learns smooth, interpretable, and physically plausible rigs, while achieving superior reconstruction and category-level generalization compared to existing auto-rigging and deformation baselines.

A matroid $\\mathcal{M}$ (in compact representation) on ground set $E$ is given, and each element $i\\in E$ is active independently with known probability $p_i\\in(0,1)$. The elements can be queried, upon which it is revealed whether the respective element is active or not. The goal is to find an adaptive querying strategy for determining whether there is a basis of $\\mathcal{M}$ in which all elements are active, with the objective of minimizing the expected number of queries.\n  When $\\mathcal{M}$ is a uniform matroid, this is the problem of evaluating a $k$-of-$n$ function, first studied in the 1970s. This problem is well-understood, and has an optimal adaptive strategy that can be computed in polynomial time.\n  Taking $\\mathcal{M}$ to instead be a partition matroid, we show that previous approaches fail to give a constant-factor approximation. Our main result is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm producing a randomized strategy for this partition matroid problem.

This approach ensures the generation of accurate, meaningful, and curriculum-aligned questions. Causal graphs provide an explicit representation of domain knowledge, while CoT reasoning facilitates a structured, step-by-step traversal of related concepts. Dedicated LLM agents are assigned specific tasks such as graph pathfinding, reasoning, validation, and output, all working within domain constraints.

Recent advances have enabled data-plane defenses against such attacks, but existing solutions typically assume symmetric routing and are limited to a single switch. These assumptions fail in modern networks where asymmetry is common, resulting in dropped legitimate responses and persistent connectivity issues. This paper presents ReAct, an in-network defense for AR-DDoS that is robust to asymmetry. ReAct performs request-response correlation across switches using programmable data planes and a sliding-window of Bloom filters. To handle asymmetric traffic, ReAct introduces a data-plane-based request forwarding mechanism, enabling switches to validate responses even when paths differ. ReAct can automatically adapt to routing changes with minimal intervention, ensuring continued protection even in dynamic network environments. We implemented ReAct on both a P4 interpreter and NVIDIAs Bluefield-3, demonstrating its applicability across multiple platforms.

Spot instances offer 3-10x lower cost than on-demand instances, but their unpredictable availability makes meeting deadlines difficult. Existing systems either rely solely on spot instances and risk deadline violations, or operate in simplified single-region settings. These approaches overlook substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in spot availability, lifetimes, and prices. We show that exploiting such heterogeneity to access more spot capacity is the key to reduce the job execution cost. We present SkyNomad, a multi-region scheduling system that maximizes spot usage and minimizes cost while guaranteeing deadlines. SkyNomad uses lightweight probing to estimate availability, predicts spot lifetimes, accounts for migration cost, and unifies regional characteristics and deadline pressure into a monetary cost model that guides scheduling decisions. Our evaluation shows that SkyNomad achieves 1.25-3.96x cost savings in real cloud deployments and performs within 10% cost differences of an optimal policy in simulation, while consistently meeting deadlines.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkyNomad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316Spot\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eAI\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56Spot\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e76\u9762\u4e34\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5355\u533a\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86Spot\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "SkyNomad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u3001\u8003\u8651\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u533a\u57df\u7279\u6027\u548c\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u5230\u8d27\u5e01\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "SkyNomad\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.25-3.96\u500d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u6ee1\u8db3\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SkyNomad\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u533a\u57df\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86AI\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002"}}

When preparing simulations for robots or applications that involve high-level scene understanding, the simulation environment must be equally detailed. Although CAD files for such environments deliver an exact description of the geometry and visuals, they usually lack semantic, relational and functional information, thus limiting the simulation and training possibilities. A 3D scene graph can organize semantic, spatial and functional information by enriching the environment through a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). In this paper we present an offline approach to creating detailed 3D scene graphs from CAD environments. This will serve as a foundation to include the relations of functional and actionable elements, which then can be used for dynamic simulation and reasoning.

Existing systems typically downsample frames or feed dense visual embeddings to large-context language models, trading off temporal coverage against cost. We propose Semantic Event Graphs (SEG), a lightweight symbolic interface between video and language that replaces raw frames with compact temporal interaction logs. Our pipeline detects and tracks objects with YOLOv11, converts proximity patterns into START/END human-object events, and organizes them into a Temporal Scene Graph (TSG). At inference time, a query-aware pruning module identifies anchor entities and lexically relevant events, returning only a small subgraph which is verbalized and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for answer generation. On five YouTube videos (300-500 interactions each) and 120 automatically generated long-horizon questions, SEG achieves 65.0% accuracy using only 3.47k tokens per query, closely matching a full-log baseline (62.5% at 40.39k tokens) while reducing token usage by 91.4%. A short-context baseline restricted to the last 30 seconds collapses to 2.5% accuracy, underscoring the need for explicit temporal memory. These results show that symbolic temporal graphs can serve as an effective, plug-and-play memory layer for off-the-shelf vision-language models, preserving long-range reasoning ability while making long-form video question answering substantially more token- and cost-efficient.

These gains, however, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding long-horizon developmental behavior, as many systems converge toward repetitive solution patterns rather than sustained growth.\n  We argue that a central limitation of contemporary AI systems lies not in capability per se, but in the premature fixation of their performance frontier. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of a \\emph{Dynamic Intelligence Ceiling} (DIC), defined as the highest level of effective intelligence attainable by a system at a given time under its current resources, internal intent, and structural configuration.\n  To make this notion empirically tractable, we propose a trajectory-centric evaluation framework that measures intelligence as a moving frontier rather than a static snapshot. We operationalize DIC using two estimators: the \\emph{Progressive Difficulty Ceiling} (PDC), which captures the maximal reliably solvable difficulty under constrained resources, and the \\emph{Ceiling Drift Rate} (CDR), which quantifies the temporal evolution of this frontier. These estimators are instantiated through a procedurally generated benchmark that jointly evaluates long-horizon planning and structural creativity within a single controlled environment.\n  Our results reveal a qualitative distinction between systems that deepen exploitation within a fixed solution manifold and those that sustain frontier expansion over time. Importantly, our framework does not posit unbounded intelligence, but reframes limits as dynamic and trajectory-dependent rather than static and prematurely fixed.\n  \\vspace{0.5em} \\noindent\\textbf{Keywords:} AI evaluation, planning and creativity, developmental intelligence, dynamic intelligence ceilings, complex adaptive systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff08DIC\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PDC\u548cCDR\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u9650\u5236\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u65e9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u957f\u671f\u53d1\u5c55\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a\u6e10\u8fdb\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\uff08PDC\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u9650\u6f02\u79fb\u7387\uff08CDR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u89e3\u6d41\u5f62\u5185\u6df1\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\uff08DIC\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u5e94\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u3002"}}

Furthermore, emerging applications increasingly demand simultaneous mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) capabilities within the same aerial network. However, jointly optimizing these operations in heterogeneous satellite-AAV systems presents significant challenges due to limited on-board resources and competing demands under dynamic channel conditions. In this work, we investigate a satellite-AAV-enabled joint MEC-DC system where these platforms collaborate to serve ground devices (GDs). Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the average MEC end-to-end delay and AAV energy consumption while maximizing the collected data. Since the formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a Q-weighted variational policy optimization-based joint AAV movement control, GD association, offloading decision, and bandwidth allocation (QAGOB) approach. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem as an action space-transformed Markov decision process to adapt the variable action dimensions and hybrid action space. Subsequently, QAGOB leverages the multi-modal generation capacities of diffusion models to optimize policies and can achieve better sample efficiency while controlling the diffusion costs during training. Simulation results show that QAGOB outperforms five other benchmarks, including traditional DRL and diffusion-based DRL algorithms.

Along with these developments, challenges and opportunities exist in the field of Quantum Software Engineering, as the development of frameworks and higher-level abstractions has attracted practitioners from diverse backgrounds. Unlike initial quantum frameworks based on the circuit model, recent frameworks and libraries leverage higher-level abstractions for creating quantum programs. This paper presents an empirical study of 985 Jupyter Notebooks from 80 open-source projects to investigate how quantum patterns are applied in practice. Our work involved two main stages. First, we built a knowledge base from three quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, PennyLane, and Classiq). This process led us to identify and document 9 new patterns that refine and extend the existing quantum computing pattern catalog. Second, we developed a reusable semantic search tool to automatically detect these patterns across our large-scale dataset, providing a practitioner-focused analysis. Our results show that developers use patterns in three levels: from foundational circuit utilities, to common algorithmic primitives (e.g., Amplitude Amplification), up to domain-specific applications for finance and optimization.

We consider task processing performance across low Earth orbit (LEO) to Low-Medium Earth Orbit (Low-MEO) constellation sizes, under varying traffic loads. Using Single-Level Tree Network(SLTN)-based cooperative task allocation architecture, we attempt to evaluate some key performance metrics - blocking probabilities, response times, energy consumption, and resource utilization across several tens of thousands of tasks per experiment. Our resource-conscious RATA monitors key parameters such as arrival rate, resources (on-board compute, storage, bandwidth, battery) availability, satellite eclipses' influence in processing and communications. This study is an important step towards analyzing the performance under lighter to stress inducing levels of compute intense workloads to test the ultimate performance limits under the combined influence of the above-mentioned factors. Results show pronounced non-linear scaling: while capacity increases with constellation size, blocking and delay grow rapidly, whereas energy remains resilient under solar-aware scheduling. The analysis identifies a practical satellite-count limit for baseline SLTNs and demonstrates that CPU availability, rather than energy, is the primary cause of blocking.

Recent work on active view planning for neural rendering largely derives next-best-view (NBV) criteria by backpropagating through radiance fields or estimating information entropy over 3D Gaussian primitives. While effective, these strategies tightly couple view selection to heavy, representation-specific mechanisms and fail to account for the computational and resource constraints required for lightweight online deployment. In this paper, we revisit active reconstruction from a renderability-centric perspective. We propose $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$-RECON, a radiance-fields-free active reconstruction framework that induces an implicit, pose-conditioned renderability field over SE(3) from a lightweight voxel map. Our formulation aggregates per-voxel online observation statistics into a unified scalar renderability score that is cheap to update and can be queried in closed form at arbitrary candidate viewpoints in milliseconds, without requiring gradients or radiance-field training.

Given Boolean functions $f, g : \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\to \\{-1, +1\\}$, Alice and Bob are tasked with determining whether $f$ and $g$ are equivalent up to a nonsingular linear transformation of the input variables, or far from being so. This problem has been extensively investigated in several models of computation, including standard algorithmic and property testing frameworks, owing to its fundamental connections with combinatorial circuit design, complexity theory, and cryptography. However, despite its broad relevance, it has remained unexplored in the context of communication complexity, a gap we address in this work.\n  Our main results demonstrate that the approximate spectral norm of the input functions plays a central role in governing the communication complexity of this problem. We design a simple deterministic protocol whose communication cost is polynomial in the approximate spectral norm, and complement it with nearly matching lower bounds (up to a quadratic gap). In the randomised setting with private coins, we present an even more efficient protocol, though equally simple, that achieves a quadratically improved dependence on the approximate spectral norm compared to the deterministic case, and we prove that such a dependence is essentially unavoidable.\n  These results identify the approximate spectral norm as a key complexity measure for testing linear invariance in the communication complexity framework. As a core technical ingredient, we establish new junta theorems for Boolean functions with small approximate spectral norm, which may be of independent interest in Fourier analysis and learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u662f\u5173\u952e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u7ebf\u6027\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u968f\u673a\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u534f\u8bae\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u540c\u6784\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u5728\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

The task remains challenging because interactions between the knife and deformable materials are highly nonlinear and often entail large deformations, frequent contact, and topological change, which in turn hinder stable and safe large-scale data collection.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that couples a vision-language-action (VLA) dataset with a physically realistic cutting simulator built on the material point method (MPM). Our simulator adopts MLS-MPM as its computational core, reducing numerical dissipation and energy drift while preserving rotational and shear responses even under topology-changing cuts. During cutting, forces and stress distributions are estimated from impulse exchanges between particles and the grid, enabling stable tracking of transient contact forces and energy transfer.\n  We also provide a benchmark dataset that integrates diverse cutting trajectories, multi-view visual observations, and fine-grained language instructions, together with force--torque and tool--pose labels to provide physically consistent training signals.\n  These components realize a learning--evaluation loop that respects the core physics of cutting and establishes a safe, reproducible, and scalable foundation for advancing VLA models in deformable object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408VLA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cMPM\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u98df\u54c1\u5207\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u98df\u54c1\u5207\u5272\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5b9e\u7528\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5200\u5177\u4e0e\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6750\u6599\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u9891\u7e41\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MLS-MPM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u8017\u6563\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5207\u5272\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u526a\u5207\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u91cf\u4ea4\u6362\u4f30\u8ba1\u529b\u548c\u5e94\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77ac\u6001\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5207\u5272\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u529b-\u626d\u77e9\u548c\u5de5\u5177-\u59ff\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MPM\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7269\u4f53\u5207\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While existing works have shown that vision-language models (VLMs) can assist RL, they often focus on knowledge distillation from the VLM to RL, overlooking the potential of RL-generated interaction data to enhance the VLM. To address this, we propose COVR, a collaborative optimization framework that enables the mutual enhancement of the VLM and RL policies. Specifically, COVR fine-tunes the VLM with RL-generated data to enhance the semantic reasoning ability consistent with the target task, and uses the enhanced VLM to further guide policy learning via action priors. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, we introduce two key modules: (1) an Exploration-Driven Dynamic Filter module that preserves valuable exploration samples using adaptive thresholds based on the degree of exploration, and (2) a Return-Aware Adaptive Loss Weight module that improves the stability of training by quantifying the inconsistency of sampling actions via return signals of RL. We further design a progressive fine-tuning strategy to reduce resource consumption.

These constellations, now equipped with inter-satellite links, can serve as low-latency Internet backbones, requiring LEO satellites to act not only as access nodes for ground stations, but also as in-orbit core routers. Due to their high velocity and the resulting frequent handovers of ground gateways, LEO networks highly stress mobility procedures at both the sender and receiver endpoints. On the other hand, a growing trend in networking is the use of technologies based on the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm for servicing IoT networks and sensor networks in general, as its addressing, storage, and security mechanisms are usually a good match for IoT needs. Furthermore, ICN networks possess additional characteristics that are beneficial for the massive LEO scenario. For instance, the mobility of the receiver is helped by the inherent data-forwarding procedures in their architectures. However, the mobility of the senders remains an open problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to the mobility problem for massive LEO constellations using the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture, as it is probably the most mature ICN proposal. Our solution includes a scalable method to relate content to ground gateways and a way to address traffic to the gateway that does not require cooperation from the network routing algorithm. Moreover, our solution works without requiring modifications to the actual NDN protocol itself, so it is easy to test and deploy. Our results indicate that, for long enough handover lengths, traffic losses are negligible even for ground stations with just one satellite in sight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eNDN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u534f\u8bae\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5546\u4e1aLEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u661f\u5ea7\u9700\u5145\u5f53\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\uff0c\u4f46LEO\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ICN\uff09\u6280\u672f\u56e0\u5176\u5bfb\u5740\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u9002\u5408\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u53d1\u9001\u8005\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u547d\u540d\u6570\u636e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NDN\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u5173\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u7edc\u8def\u7531\u7b97\u6cd5\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u5bfb\u5740\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u957f\u7684\u5207\u6362\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u4ec5\u6709\u4e00\u9897\u536b\u661f\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u6d41\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4e5f\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u6570\u636e\u7f51\u7edc\uff08NDN\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5168\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\uff08LEO\uff09\u661f\u5ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539NDN\u534f\u8bae\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u957f\u7684\u5207\u6362\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u4ec5\u6709\u4e00\u9897\u536b\u661f\u5728\u89c6\u7ebf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u6d41\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u4e5f\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Widely used performance models primarily focus on cache and memory bandwidth, which is suitable for many memory-bound workloads. However, it is unsuitable for highly arithmetic intensive cases such as the sum-factorization with tensor $n$-mode product kernels, which are an optimization technique for high-order finite element methods (FEM). On processors with relatively high single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction latency, such as the Fujitsu A64FX, the performance of these kernels is strongly influenced by loop-body splitting strategies. Memory-bandwidth-oriented models are therefore not appropriate for evaluating these splitting configurations, and a model that directly reflects instruction-level efficiency is required. To address this need, we develop a dependency-chain-based analytical formulation that links loop-splitting configurations to instruction dependencies in the tensor $n$-mode product kernel. We further use XGBoost to estimate key parameters in the analytical model that are difficult to model explicitly. Evaluations show that the learning-augmented model outperforms the widely used standard Roofline and Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) models. On the Fujitsu A64FX processor, the learning-augmented model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) between 1% and 24% for polynomial orders ($P$) from 1 to 15. In comparison, the standard Roofline and ECM models yield errors of 42%-256% and 5%-117%, respectively. On the Intel Xeon Gold 6230 processor, the learning-augmented model achieves MAPE values from 1% to 13% for $P$=1 to $P$=14, and 24% at $P$=15. In contrast, the standard Roofline and ECM models produce errors of 1%-73% and 8%-112% for $P$=1 to $P$=15, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u548cXGBoost\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6838\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6838\uff08\u5982\u5f20\u91cf$n$-\u6a21\u79ef\u6838\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u6307\u4ee4\u7ea7\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408XGBoost\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fujitsu A64FX\u548cIntel Xeon Gold 6230\u5904\u7406\u5668\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Roofline\u548cECM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408XGBoost\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u672f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6838\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

The survey of this survey is particularly focused on most challenging facial characteristics, including differences in the light, ageing, variation in poses, partial occlusion, and facial expression and presents methodological solutions. The factors, therefore, are inevitable in the creation of effective facial recognition mechanisms used on facial images. This paper reviews the most sophisticated methods of facial detection which are Hidden Markov Models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Elastic Cluster Plot Matching, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor Waves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Eigenfaces, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and 3D Morphable Model. Alongside the works mentioned above, we have also analyzed the images of a number of facial databases, namely JAFEE, FEI, Yale, LFW, AT&T (then called ORL), and AR (created by Martinez and Benavente), to analyze the results.

Two prominent approaches for solving VSPs are dynamic programming over tree-like structures, such as tree decompositions or clique decompositions, and linear programming. In this work, we establish a sharp connection between both approaches by showing that if a vertex-subset problem $\u03a0$ admits a solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithm that produces tables of size at most $\u03b1(k,n)$ when processing a tree decomposition of width at most $k$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, then the polytope $P_\u03a0(G)$ defined as the convex-hull of solutions of $\u03a0$ in $G$ has extension complexity at most $O(\u03b1(k,n)\\cdot n)$. Additionally, this upper bound is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH).\n  On the one hand, our results imply that ETH-optimal solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms for combinatorial problems yield optimal-size parameterized extended formulations for the solution polytopes associated with instances of these problems.

While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) established the dominant paradigm, a proliferation of alternatives -- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), and many others -- has left practitioners without clear guidance on method selection. This survey provides a \\textit{theoretical unification} of preference learning methods, revealing that the apparent diversity reduces to principled choices along three orthogonal axes: \\textbf{(I) Preference Model} (what likelihood model underlies the objective), \\textbf{(II) Regularization Mechanism} (how deviation from reference policies is controlled), and \\textbf{(III) Data Distribution} (online vs.\\ offline learning and coverage requirements). We formalize each axis with precise definitions and theorems, establishing key results including the coverage separation between online and offline methods, scaling laws for reward overoptimization, and conditions under which direct alignment methods fail. Our analysis reveals that failure modes -- length hacking, mode collapse, likelihood displacement -- arise from specific, predictable combinations of design choices. We synthesize empirical findings across 50+ papers and provide a practitioner's decision guide for method selection.

Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ReAct\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff08IBN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u53d8\u5f02\u5904\u7406\u6216\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c6G\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u534f\u8c03\u8005\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08RAN\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u63a8\u7406-\u884c\u52a8\uff08ReAct\uff09\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8eO-RAN\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f16\u6392\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These agents differ fundamentally from traditional software: their behavior is not fixed at deployment but continuously shaped by experience, feedback, and context. Applying operational principles inherited from DevOps or MLOps, built for deterministic software and traditional ML systems, assumes that system behavior can be managed through versioning, monitoring, and rollback. This assumption breaks down for Agentic AI systems whose learning trajectories diverge over time. This introduces non-determinism making system reliability a challenge at runtime. We argue that architecting such systems requires a shift from managing control loops to enabling dynamic co-evolution among agents, infrastructure, and human oversight. To guide this shift, we introduce CHANGE, a conceptual framework comprising six capabilities for operationalizing Agentic AI systems: Contextualize, Harmonize, Anticipate, Negotiate, Generate, and Evolve. CHANGE provides a foundation for architecting an AgentOps platform to manage the lifecycle of evolving Agentic AI systems, illustrated through a customer-support system scenario.

This paper presents two new frameworks, named DiveRgence-based Adaptive aGgregation (DRAG) and Byzantine-Resilient DRAG (BR-DRAG), to mitigate client drifts and resist attacks while expediting training. DRAG designs a reference direction and a metric named divergence of degree to quantify the deviation of local updates. Accordingly, each worker can align its local update via linear calibration without extra communication cost. BR-DRAG refines DRAG under Byzantine attacks by maintaining a vetted root dataset at the server to produce trusted reference directions.

The central challenge is to balance consistency and robustness: when predictions are accurate, the algorithm should select a near-optimal secretary, while under inaccurate predictions it should still guarantee a bounded competitive ratio.\n  We consider both the classical Random Order Secretary Problem (ROSP), where candidates arrive in a uniformly random order, and a more natural learning-augmented model in which the decision-maker may choose the arrival order based on predicted values. We call this model the Chosen Order Secretary Problem (COSP), capturing scenarios such as interview schedules set in advance.\n  We propose a new randomized algorithm applicable to both ROSP and COSP. Our method switches from fully trusting predictions to a threshold-based rule once a large prediction deviation is detected. Let $\u03b5\\in [0,1]$ denote the maximum multiplicative prediction error.

As a practical solution, machine unlearning aims to selectively erase unwanted concepts from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch. While most existing methods are effective for single-concept unlearning, they often struggle in real-world scenarios that require removing multiple concepts, since extending them to this setting is both non-trivial and problematic, causing significant challenges in unlearning effectiveness, generation quality, and sensitivity to hyperparameters and datasets. In this paper, we take a unique perspective on multi-concept unlearning by leveraging model sparsity and propose the Forget It All (FIA) framework. FIA first introduces Contrastive Concept Saliency to quantify each weight connection's contribution to a target concept. It then identifies Concept-Sensitive Neurons by combining temporal and spatial information, ensuring that only neurons consistently responsive to the target concept are selected. Finally, FIA constructs masks from the identified neurons and fuses them into a unified multi-concept mask, where Concept-Agnostic Neurons that broadly support general content generation are preserved while concept-specific neurons are pruned to remove the targets. FIA is training-free and requires only minimal hyperparameter tuning for new tasks, thereby promoting a plug-and-play paradigm.

We present CBMAS, a diagnostic framework for continuous activation steering, which extends cognitive bias analysis from discrete before/after interventions to interpretable trajectories. By combining steering vector construction with dense \u03b1-sweeps, logit lens-based bias curves, and layer-site sensitivity analysis, our approach can reveal tipping points where small intervention strengths flip model behavior and show how steering effects evolve across layer depth.

Evaluating LLMs in Resolving Context Adaptation Bugs During Code Adaptation", "comment": "24 pages, 11 figures, accepted by FSE 2026", "summary": "Code adaptation is a fundamental but challenging task in software development, requiring developers to modify existing code for new contexts. A key challenge is to resolve Context Adaptation Bugs (CtxBugs), which occurs when code correct in its original context violates constraints in the target environment. Unlike isolated bugs, CtxBugs cannot be resolved through local fixes and require cross-context reasoning to identify semantic mismatches. Overlooking them may lead to critical failures in adaptation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great potential in automating code-related tasks, their ability to resolve CtxBugs remains a significant and unexplored obstacle to their practical use in code adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose CtxBugGen, a novel framework for generating CtxBugs to evaluate LLMs. Its core idea is to leverage LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but context-free code when contextual constraints are absent. The framework generates CtxBugs through a four-step process to ensure their relevance and validity: (1) Adaptation Task Selection, (2) Task-specific Perturbation,(3) LLM-based Variant Generation and (4) CtxBugs Identification. Based on the benchmark constructed by CtxBugGen, we conduct an empirical study with four state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal their unsatisfactory performance in CtxBug resolution. The best performing LLM, Kimi-K2, achieves 55.93% on Pass@1 and resolves just 52.47% of CtxBugs. The presence of CtxBugs degrades LLMs' adaptation performance by up to 30%. Failure analysis indicates that LLMs often overlook CtxBugs and replicate them in their outputs.

However, localization using only Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) suffers from drift caused by motion-process noise and sensor biases. This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Map-constrained Inertial Localization (UMLoc), an end-to-end framework that jointly models IMU uncertainty and map constraints to achieve drift-resilient positioning. UMLoc integrates two coupled modules: (1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) quantile regressor, which estimates the specific quantiles needed to define 68%, 90%, and 95% prediction intervals serving as a measure of localization uncertainty and (2) a Conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) with cross-attention that fuses IMU dynamic data with distance-based floor-plan maps to generate geometrically feasible trajectories.

Traditional approaches rely on aggregate statistical models that capture historical correlations but lack mechanistic interpretability and struggle with novel policy scenarios. We present a general framework for constructing Social Digital Twins - virtual population replicas where Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as cognitive engines for individual agents. Each agent, characterized by demographic and psychographic attributes, receives policy signals and outputs multi-dimensional behavioral probability vectors. A calibration layer maps aggregated agent responses to observable population-level metrics, enabling validation against real-world data and deployment for counterfactual policy analysis.\n  We instantiate this framework in the domain of pandemic response, using COVID-19 as a case study with rich observational data. On a held-out test period, our calibrated digital twin achieves a 20.7% improvement in macro-averaged prediction error over gradient boosting baselines across six behavioral categories. Counterfactual experiments demonstrate monotonic and bounded responses to policy variations, establishing behavioral plausibility. The framework is domain-agnostic: the same architecture applies to transportation policy, economic interventions, environmental regulations, or any setting where policy affects population behavior.

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored.

In TLM, a laser beam is used to cut target tissue, while forceps are employed to grasp, manipulate, and stabilize tissue within the UADT. Although TLM systems may rely on different technologies and interfaces, forceps manipulation is still predominantly performed manually, introducing limitations in ergonomics, precision, and controllability. This paper proposes a novel robotic system for tissue manipulation in UADT procedures, based on a novel end-effector designed for forceps control. The system is integrated within a teleoperation framework that employs a robotic manipulator with a programmed remote center of motion (RCM), enabling precise and constrained instrument motion while improving surgeon ergonomics. The proposed approach is validated through two experimental studies and a dedicated usability evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness and suitability for UADT surgical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u6d88\u5316\u9053\u624b\u672f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u94b3\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTLM\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u94b3\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u578b\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08RCM\uff09\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0a\u6d88\u5316\u9053\u624b\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0a\u6d88\u5316\u9053\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose B-FIRE, a binning-free diffusion implicit neural representation framework for hyper-accelerated MR reconstruction capable of reflecting instantaneous 3D abdominal anatomy. B-FIRE employs a CNN-INR encoder-decoder backbone optimized using diffusion with a comprehensive loss that enforces image-domain fidelity and frequency-aware constraints. Motion binned image pairs were used as training references, while inference was performed on binning-free undersampled data. Experiments were conducted on a T1-weighted StarVIBE liver MRI cohort, with accelerations ranging from 8 spokes per frame (RV8) to RV1.

ReliabilityBench contributes a unified reliability surface $R(k,\u03b5,\u03bb)$, \\textit{action metamorphic relations} that define correctness via end-state equivalence rather than text similarity, and a chaos-engineering-style fault injection framework (timeouts, rate limits, partial responses, schema drift). We evaluate two models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) and two agent architectures (ReAct, Reflexion) across four domains (scheduling, travel, customer support, e-commerce) over 1,280 episodes. Perturbations alone reduce success from 96.9% at $\u03b5=0$ to 88.1% at $\u03b5=0.2$. Rate limiting is the most damaging fault in ablations. ReAct is more robust than Reflexion under combined stress, and Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves comparable reliability to GPT-4o at much lower cost.

This exploratory pilot survey explores how agile R&D software teams report the use of practices and metrics related to technical quality control within Scrum-based environments. The study employed a structured questionnaire administered to professionals from Science and Technology Institutions (STIs) located in Manaus, Brazil, aiming to capture reported practices, perceptions of quality, and recurrent challenges. Quantitative data were complemented by qualitative responses to support contextual interpretation. The results indicate that although practices such as automated testing, code review, and continuous integration are widely acknowledged, their reported application is often inconsistent across iterations. Gaps were also observed in the monitoring of technical quality metrics and in the reporting of mechanisms for assessing technical debt from a business perspective.

MegaFlow abstracts agent training infrastructure into three independent services (Model Service, Agent Service, and Environment Service) that interact through unified interfaces, enabling independent scaling and flexible resource allocation across diverse agent-environment configurations.

We propose a novel semantic navigation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer patterns from partial observations and predict regions where the goal is most likely located. Our method combines local perceptual inputs with frontier-based exploration and periodic LLM queries, which extract symbolic patterns (e.g., room numbering schemes and building layout structures) and update a confidence grid used to guide exploration. This enables robots to move efficiently toward goal locations labeled with textual identifiers (e.g., \"room 8\") even before direct observation. We demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient navigation in sparse, partially observable grid environments by exploiting symbolic patterns.

Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry.

Existing length extrapolation methods often suffer from performance degradation or computational inefficiencies. We thereby use a unified framework that reinterprets positional encoding methods as a decomposition of the attention score into a multiplicative transformation and an additive bias. This perspective not only subsumes popular approaches such as relative position embeddings and attention-bias moderated approaches but also exposes their inherent limitations in handling long-range dependencies. To address these shortcomings, motivated by our framework, we introduce Adaptive Positional Encoding (APE), which leverages adaptive frequency modulation and an intricately designed decay bias that incorporates linear, logarithmic, and square-root terms. Our theoretical analysis establishes conditions for infinite-context extrapolation, ensuring that the softmax normalization remains well-defined over unbounded sequences while preserving long-distance correlations, entropy boundedness and gradient positional sensitivity.

Fairness issues have attracted increasing attention since machine learning software is increasingly used for high-stakes and high-risk decisions. It is the responsibility of all software developers to make their software accountable by ensuring that the machine learning software do not perform differently on different sensitive groups -- satisfying the separation criterion. However, evaluation of separation requires ground truth labels for each test data point. This motivates our work on analyzing whether separation can be evaluated on comparative judgment test data. Instead of asking humans to provide the ratings or categorical labels on each test data point, comparative judgments are made between pairs of data points such as A is better than B. According to the law of comparative judgment, providing such comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden for humans than providing ratings or categorical labels. This work first defines the novel fairness notion comparative separation on comparative judgment test data, and the metrics to evaluate comparative separation. Then, both theoretically and empirically, we show that in binary classification problems, comparative separation is equivalent to separation. Lastly, we analyze the number of test data points and test data pairs required to achieve the same level of statistical power in the evaluation of separation and comparative separation, respectively. This work is the first to explore fairness evaluation on comparative judgment test data. It shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of using comparative judgment test data for model evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u6ee1\u8db3\u5206\u79bb\u51c6\u5219\uff09\u6765\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u9700\u8981\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u79bb\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u8f83\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

However, several high-profile incidents involving large-scale drone failures -- where multiple drones simultaneously fall from the sky -- have raised safety and reliability concerns. To ensure robustness, we propose a drone parking algorithm designed specifically for multiple drone failures in drone light shows, aimed at mitigating the risk of cascading collisions by drone evacuation and enabling rapid recovery from failures by leveraging strategically placed hidden drones. Our algorithm integrates a Social LSTM model with attention mechanisms to predict the trajectories of failing drones and compute near-optimal evacuation paths that minimize the likelihood of surviving drones being hit by fallen drones. In the recovery node, our system deploys hidden drones (operating with their LED lights turned off) to replace failed drones so that the drone light show can continue. Our experiments showed that our approach can greatly increase the robustness of a multi-drone system by leveraging deep learning to predict the trajectories of fallen drones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u505c\u8f66\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u706f\u5149\u79c0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u706f\u5149\u79c0\u4e2d\u591a\u673a\u540c\u65f6\u6545\u969c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fde\u9501\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Social LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u758f\u6563\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u9690\u85cf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u706f\u5149\u79c0\u4e2d\u591a\u673a\u6545\u969c\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u758f\u6563\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u85cf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges effectively, we propose TBDN, a training-free framework integrating two complementary closed-loop mechanisms: Hint Instruction (HI) and Query Contrastive Decoding (QCD). HI injects task-aware inductive bias via lightweight prompt engineering to anchor models on contextual mapping rules, thereby mitigating compliance failure. QCD adjusts the decoding distributions of language models by contrasting full-input and query-omitted distributions, suppressing prior-dominated hallucination. TBDN achieves State-of-the-Art performance on CoBSAT and Text-to-Image Fast Mini-ImageNet, with robust generalization across model backbones, prompt designs, and hyperparameters. It also maintains promising performance in concept preservation and prompt following on Dreambench++.

Drawing on Jung's notion of the collective unconscious as a shared repository of archetypal forms, we introduce an Artificial Collective Unconscious (ACU): a shared dream pool where agents contribute de-identified, abstract Interaction Templates that are later re-instantiated as idiosyncratic Dream Narratives. The Dream Layer runs strictly offline: logic-enforcing modules are relaxed and sampling temperature is increased, yielding safe but deliberately bizarre narratives (e.g., travel sequences with mismatched currencies) that augment data for rare events and edge-case safety tests; to harness risk productively, we add a governance stack of strict abstraction, temporal delays, and ephemeral memory. Through behavioural simulations of everyday dialogue and long-horizon adaptation tasks, we show that the Dream Layer enables a critical decoupling: agents remain firm on safety constraints (e.g., security policies) while becoming flexible in narrative strategy (e.g., using shared archetypal metaphors to resolve deadlocks), conceptually reframing hallucination so that online, unmarked instances remain bugs, whereas bounded, marked, and delayed ones become a goldmine for synthetic scenarios and deepened companionship, echoing anti-overfitting dream mechanisms proposed in contemporary neuroscience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u96c6\u4f53\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\uff08ACU\uff09\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5806\u6808\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u53d9\u4e8b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f34\u4fa3\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4e2a\u4eba\u68a6\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u786c\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u969c\u788d\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5e7b\u89c9\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u96c6\u4f53\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u201d\uff08ACU\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u68a6\u5883\u6c60\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u8d21\u732e\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u68a6\u5883\u53d9\u4e8b\u3002\u653e\u677e\u903b\u8f91\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u4f46\u5947\u7279\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u77ed\u6682\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u5806\u6808\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u53d9\u4e8b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\uff08\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u539f\u578b\u9690\u55bb\u89e3\u51b3\u50f5\u5c40\uff09\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6210\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f34\u4fa3\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8363\u683c\u96c6\u4f53\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u201c\u68a6\u5883\u5c42\u201d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53d9\u4e8b\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f34\u4fa3\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Accessing this open-world experience is hindered by the unstructured and fragmented nature of real-world issue-tracking data. In this paper, we introduce MemGovern, a framework designed to govern and transform raw GitHub data into actionable experiential memory for agents.

Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models.

Existing solutions typically resort to a heavy \"data engineering\" paradigm-synthesizing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This pipeline primarily optimizes probability sampling efficiency and aligns output distributions, but fails to activate the intrinsic intelligence required for dynamic visual exploration. In this work, we propose TIR-Flow, a novel framework that shifts the paradigm from passive processing to active video searching and reasoning without additional data or parameter updating. Concretely, our framework operates through three synergistic modules: HDD decomposes complex queries into a set of verifiable sub-tasks; HAP actively directs visual attention to gather high-resolution evidence for hypothesis validation; EBA maintains a persistent workspace to accumulate and update the discovered clues for logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TIR-Flow significantly outperforms recent strong baselines, delivering an average performance boost of 5.9%, with gains reaching 10.5% on Egoschema.

Recent work has explored automating this process with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, but existing approaches either rely on a single generic agent that struggles in complex scenarios or narrowly specialized agents that cannot adapt to diverse vulnerability types. We therefore introduce PenForge, a framework that dynamically constructs expert agents during testing rather than relying on those prepared beforehand. By integrating automated reconnaissance of potential attack surfaces with agents instantiated on the fly for context-aware exploitation, PenForge achieves a 30.0% exploit success rate (12/40) on CVE-Bench in the particularly challenging zero-day setting, which is a 3 times improvement over the state-of-the-art. Our analysis also identifies three opportunities for future work: (1) supplying richer tool-usage knowledge to improve exploitation effectiveness; (2) extending benchmarks to include more vulnerabilities and attack types; and (3) fostering developer trust by incorporating explainable mechanisms and human review. As an emerging result with substantial potential impact, PenForge embodies the early-stage yet paradigm-shifting idea of on-the-fly agent construction, marking its promise as a step toward scalable and effective LLM-driven penetration testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "PenForge\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u96f6\u65e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e2d\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad83\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "PenForge\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u4fa6\u5bdf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728CVE-Bench\u7684\u96f6\u65e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPenForge\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630.0%\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0812/40\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e863\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PenForge\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e9\u671f\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee3\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u65e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Preprint version of a manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics", "summary": "This paper presents a single-actuator passive gripper that achieves both stable grasping and continuous bidirectional in-hand rotation through mechanically encoded power transmission logic. Unlike conventional multifunctional grippers that require multiple actuators, sensors, or control-based switching, the proposed gripper transitions between grasping and rotation solely according to the magnitude of the applied input torque. The key enabler of this behavior is a Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM), which generates non-coplanar motions, namely axial contraction and rotation, from a single rotational input while producing identical contraction regardless of rotation direction. A friction generator mechanically defines torque thresholds that govern passive mode switching, enabling stable grasp establishment before autonomously transitioning to in-hand rotation without sensing or active control. Analytical models describing the kinematics, elastic force generation, and torque transmission of the TUM are derived and experimentally validated. The fabricated gripper is evaluated through quantitative experiments on grasp success, friction-based grasp force regulation, and bidirectional rotation performance. System-level demonstrations, including bolt manipulation, object reorientation, and manipulator-integrated tasks driven solely by wrist torque, confirm reliable grasp to rotate transitions in both rotational directions. These results demonstrate that non-coplanar multifunctional manipulation can be realized through mechanical design alone, establishing mechanically encoded power transmission logic as a robust alternative to actuator and control intensive gripper architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u6267\u884c\u5668\u88ab\u52a8\u5939\u6301\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u7f16\u7801\u903b\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5939\u6301\u5668\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Twisted Underactuated Mechanism (TUM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8f74\u5411\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u975e\u5171\u9762\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6469\u64e6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b9a\u4e49\u626d\u77e9\u9608\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u88ab\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TUM\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u529b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5939\u6301\u5668\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u3001\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u7f16\u7801\u52a8\u529b\u4f20\u8f93\u903b\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5355\u6267\u884c\u5668\u88ab\u52a8\u5939\u6301\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u5e76\u8fde\u7eed\u53cc\u5411\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5171\u9762\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

This is due to the finite precision effects of the arithmetic operations, which depend on the order in which they are executed. This order, in turn, depends on the processes that are running concurrently on the GPU. Previous studies have focused on the impact of nondeterminism on the text generated by the LLMs or on proposing mechanisms to achieve deterministic execution. This work takes a closer look at nondeterminism by analyzing the variations on the token probabilities, not on the generated text. Interestingly, all the models evaluated have similar results in both the trends and the actual values of the variations of the probabilities. In particular, the results show that the effects of nondeterminism are significant for token probabilities that are in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, while they are much smaller when the probabilities are close to 0 or 1. This has significant implications for our understanding of nondeterminism. The first is that nondeterminism will likely have a non-negligible impact on generated text when the temperature is not zero, as it introduces significant variations in the token probabilities except when they are close to 0 or 1. Secondly, it suggests that all models have similar non deterministic variations at the token probability level. Therefore, different variations in the performance of the generated text, for example, when measuring accuracy on a benchmark, seem to come from different token probabilities or response lengths. A third implication is that we may be able to estimate the impact of nondeterminism by running a single inference and analyzing the token level probabilities, instead of having to run the same inference many times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5bf9token\u6982\u7387\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f0.1-0.9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76LLMs\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5bf9token\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u6216\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790token\u6982\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728token\u6982\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u503c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u6982\u7387\u503c0.1\u81f30.9\u65f6\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd10\u62161\u65f6\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5bf9token\u6982\u7387\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6982\u7387\u503c\u4ecb\u4e8e0.1\u81f30.9\u4e4b\u95f4\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Traditional syntax and semantic-based parsers often struggle with semantic variations in evolving logs and data scarcity stemming from their limited domain coverage. Recent large language model (LLM)-based parsers leverage in-context learning (ICL) to extract semantics from examples, demonstrating superior accuracy. However, LLM-based parsers face two main challenges: 1) underutilization of ICL capabilities, particularly in dynamic example selection and cross-domain generalization, leading to inconsistent performance; 2) time-consuming and costly LLM querying. To address these challenges, we present MicLog, the first progressive meta in-context learning (ProgMeta-ICL) log parsing framework that combines meta-learning with ICL on small open-source LLMs (i.e., Qwen-2.5-3B). Specifically, MicLog: i) enhances LLMs' ICL capability through a zero-shot to k-shot ProgMeta-ICL paradigm, employing weighted DBSCAN candidate sampling and enhanced BM25 demonstration selection; ii) accelerates parsing via a multi-level pre-query cache that dynamically matches and refines recently parsed templates. Evaluated on Loghub-2.0, MicLog achieves 10.3% higher parsing accuracy than the state-of-the-art parser while reducing parsing time by 42.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MicLog\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548cICL\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLLM-based\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u5728ICL\u80fd\u529b\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548cICL\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743DBSCAN\u5019\u9009\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u589e\u5f3aBM25\u6f14\u793a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7ea7\u9884\u67e5\u8be2\u7f13\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5728Loghub-2.0\u4e0a\uff0cMicLog\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u9ad810.3%\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1142.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "MicLog\u901a\u8fc7ProgMeta-ICL\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u548cLLM-based\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The core of the proposed framework is represented by the distributed Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) model, which unifies and extends classical formulations such as Dahl and LuGre by describing the rolling contact process as a spatially distributed system governed by semilinear partial differential equations (PDEs). This model is systematically integrated into a single-track vehicle framework, where the resulting semilinear ODE-PDE interconnection captures the interaction between lateral vehicle motion and tyre deformation. Two main variants are considered: one with rigid tyre carcass and another with flexible carcass, each admitting a compact state-space representation. Local and global well-posedness properties for the coupled system are established rigorously, highlighting the dissipative and physically consistent properties of the distributed FrBD model. A linearisation procedure is also presented, enabling spectral analysis and transfer function derivation, and potentially facilitating the synthesis of controllers and observers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the model's capability to capture micro-shimmy oscillations and transient lateral responses to advanced steering manoeuvres. The proposed formulation advances the state-of-the-art in vehicle dynamics modelling by providing a physically grounded, mathematically rigorous, and computationally tractable approach to incorporating transient tyre behaviour in lateral vehicle dynamics, when accounting for the effect of limited friction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFrBD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fa7\u5411\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u4e14\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFriction with Bristle Dynamics\uff08FrBD\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u8f68\u8f66\u8f86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\u63cf\u8ff0\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5355\u8f68\u8f66\u8f86\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u534a\u7ebf\u6027ODE-PDE\u4e92\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u521a\u6027\u8f6e\u80ce\u80ce\u4f53\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u8f6e\u80ce\u80ce\u4f53\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u6446\u632f\u8361\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8f6c\u5411\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u4fa7\u5411\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFrBD\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6469\u64e6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4fa7\u5411\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u77ac\u6001\u8f6e\u80ce\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

With the growing availability of online cooking videos, there is unprecedented potential to study such culinary variations using computational tools systematically. However, existing video understanding methods fail to capture the fine-grained, multimodal, and culturally grounded differences in procedural cooking videos. This work presents the first large-scale, curated dataset of biryani preparation videos, comprising 120 high-quality YouTube recordings across 12 distinct regional styles. We propose a multi-stage framework leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) to segment videos into fine-grained procedural units and align them with audio transcripts and canonical recipe text. Building on these aligned representations, we introduce a video comparison pipeline that automatically identifies and explains procedural differences between regional variants. We construct a comprehensive question-answer (QA) benchmark spanning multiple reasoning levels to evaluate procedural understanding in VLMs. Our approach employs multiple VLMs in complementary roles, incorporates human-in-the-loop verification for high-precision tasks, and benchmarks several state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. The resulting dataset, comparison methodology, and QA benchmark provide a new testbed for evaluating VLMs on structured, multimodal reasoning tasks and open new directions for computational analysis of cultural heritage through cooking videos.

Existing end-to-end paradigms, which typically treat dashboard generation as a direct code generation task (e.g., raw HTML), suffer from two fundamental limitations: representation redundancy due to massive tokens spent on visual rendering, and low controllability caused by the entanglement of analytical reasoning and presentation. To address these challenges, we propose NL2Dashboard, a lightweight framework grounded in the principle of Analysis-Presentation Decoupling. We introduce a structured intermediate representation (IR) that encapsulates the dashboard's content, layout, and visual elements. Therefore, it confines the LLM's role to data analysis and intent translation, while offloading visual synthesis to a deterministic rendering engine. Building upon this framework, we develop a multi-agent system in which the IR-driven algorithm is instantiated as a suite of tools. Comprehensive experiments conducted with this system demonstrate that NL2Dashboard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains, achieving superior visual quality, significantly higher token efficiency, and precise controllability in both generation and modification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "NL2Dashboard\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790-\u5448\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNL2Dashboard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08IR\uff09\u5c01\u88c5\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u89d2\u8272\u9650\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u7531\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u64ce\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "NL2Dashboard\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210/\u4fee\u6539\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NL2Dashboard\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790-\u5448\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4ee4\u724c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners adopt GenAI tools in real-world organizational contexts, focusing on regulatory conditions, use cases, benefits, and barriers. Method: An exploratory multiple case study was conducted in three German organizations, involving 17 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. A cross-case thematic analysis was applied to identify GenAI adoption patterns. Results: Findings reveal that GenAI is primarily used for creative tasks, documentation, and code assistance. Benefits include efficiency gains and enhanced creativity, while barriers relate to data privacy, validation effort, and lack of governance. Using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, we find that these barriers stem from misalignments across the three dimensions. Regulatory pressures are often translated into policies without accounting for actual technological usage patterns or organizational constraints. This leads to systematic gaps between policy and practice.

This work introduces a novel bearing-box approach that fully leverages modern 3D detection measurements that are widely available nowadays but have not been well explored for motion estimation so far. Unlike existing methods that rely on restrictive assumptions such as isotropic target shape and lateral motion, our bearing-box estimator can estimate both the target's motion and its physical size without these assumptions by exploiting the information buried in a 3D bounding box. When applied to multi-rotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), the estimator yields an interesting advantage: it further removes the need for higher-order motion assumptions by exploiting the unique coupling between MAV's acceleration and thrust. This is particularly significant, as higher-order motion assumptions are widely believed to be necessary in state-of-the-art bearing-based estimators. We support our claims with rigorous observability analyses and extensive experimental validation, demonstrating the estimator's superior performance in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ebearing-box\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eMAV\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8ebearing\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u3001\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u4ee33D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528bearing-box\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee33D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eMAV\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u529b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728MAV\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u9636\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ebearing-box\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u9650\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u5fae\u578b\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08MAV\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Perfective commits constitute 40.8% of all changes, suggesting that feature enhancement is prioritized over corrective maintenance (27.4%) and adaptive updates (24.3%). Data about issues shows that the most frequent concerns involve bugs (22%), infrastructure (14%), and agent coordination challenges (10%). Issue reporting also increased sharply across all frameworks starting in 2023. Median resolution times range from under one day to about two weeks, with distributions skewed toward fast responses but a minority of issues requiring extended attention.

We present ObjSplat, an active reconstruction framework that leverages Gaussian surfels as a unified representation to progressively reconstruct unknown objects with both photorealistic appearance and accurate geometry. Addressing the limitations of conventional opacity or depth-based cues, we introduce a geometry-aware viewpoint evaluation pipeline that explicitly models back-face visibility and occlusion-aware multi-view covisibility, reliably identifying under-reconstructed regions even on geometrically complex objects. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of greedy planning strategies, ObjSplat employs a next-best-path (NBP) planner that performs multi-step lookahead on a dynamically constructed spatial graph. By jointly optimizing information gain and movement cost, this planner generates globally efficient trajectories. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real-world cultural artifacts demonstrate that ObjSplat produces physically consistent models within minutes, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity and surface completeness while significantly reducing scan time and path length compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u95e8\u63a7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u3002\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u867d\u5feb\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u95e8\u63a7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5347\u7ea7\u9608\u503c\u548c\u53d1\u5e03-\u8ba2\u9605\u901a\u4fe1\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e09\u500d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u6548\u7387\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u89c9\u76d1\u63a7\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in simulation is approximately 1.67e-2 radians, while experimental validation yields an error of 0.2 radians. Additionally, the controller achieves a settling time of less than 3 seconds and a steady-state error below 1e-1 radians, consistently observed across both simulation and experimental evaluations. Comparative analyses confirm that the developed SMC surpasses alternative control strategies in motion accuracy, rapid convergence, and steady-state precision.

This is useful in cases where the amount of data is large and labelling is expensive, such as in machine vision or medical imaging. Two particularities of machine vision are first, that most of the images produced are free of defects, and second, that the amount of images produced is so big that we cannot store all acquired images. This results, on the one hand, in a strong class imbalance in defect distribution and, on the other hand, in a potential label shift caused by limited storage. To understand how these two forms of imbalance affect active learning algorithms, we propose a simulation study based on two open-source datasets. We artificially create datasets for which we control the levels of class imbalance and label shift. Three standard active learning selection strategies are compared: random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection. We demonstrate that active learning strategies, and in particular the entropy-based and core-set selections, remain interesting and efficient even for highly imbalanced datasets. We also illustrate and measure the loss of efficiency that occurs in the situation a strong label shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Active learning remains effective in imbalanced datasets, though label shift reduces efficiency, as shown by a simulation study comparing random, entropy-based, and core-set selection methods.", "motivation": "To understand the impact of class imbalance and label shift on active learning algorithms in machine vision and medical imaging, where data is abundant but labeling is costly.", "method": "A simulation study using two open-source datasets with controlled class imbalance and label shift levels, comparing random sampling, entropy-based selection, and core-set selection.", "result": "Active learning strategies (entropy-based and core-set) are efficient in imbalanced datasets, but efficiency decreases with significant label shift.", "conclusion": "Active learning strategies, particularly entropy-based and core-set selections, remain effective even in highly imbalanced datasets, though efficiency loss occurs with strong label shift."}}

Many methods have been proposed in the literature to enhance software fairness. However, the majority behave as a black-box, not allowing stakeholders to prioritise fairness or effectiveness (i.e., prediction correctness) based on their needs. Aims: In this paper, we introduce FairRF, a novel approach based on multi-objective evolutionary search to optimise fairness and effectiveness in classification tasks. FairRF uses a Random Forest (RF) model as a base classifier and searches for the best hyperparameter configurations and data mutation to maximise fairness and effectiveness. Eventually, it returns a set of Pareto optimal solutions, allowing the final stakeholders to choose the best one based on their needs. Method: We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of FairRF against 26 different baselines in 11 different scenarios using five effectiveness and three fairness metrics. Additionally, we also include two variations of the fairness metrics for intersectional bias for a total of six definitions analysed. Result: Our results show that FairRF can significantly improve the fairness of base classifiers, while maintaining consistent prediction effectiveness. Additionally, FairRF provides a more consistent optimisation under all fairness definitions compared to state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods and overcomes the existing state-of-the-art approach for intersectional bias mitigation.

Our approach demonstrates that incorporating physics-inspired inductive biases into neural architectures yields significant improvements: state-of-the-art video prediction (FVD: 287), 4x faster visual synthesis than diffusion models, and 3-18x inference speedup over transformer baselines while maintaining energy conservation over extended horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Akasha 2\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u878d\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Mamba-3 SSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SMoE-HE\u5f3a\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7HFM\u548c3DGS\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\uff08FVD: 287\uff09\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5feb4\u500d\uff09\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u6bd4Transformer\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb3-18\u500d\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Akasha 2\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408H-SSD\u4e0eVL-JEPA\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SMoE-HE\u548cHFM\u7b49\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We term this disconnect the allocation gap and provide a decision-theoretic explanation by modelling healthcare delivery as a stochastic allocation problem under binding resource constraints. In this framework, AI acts as decision infrastructure that estimates utility rather than making autonomous decisions. Using constrained optimisation and Markov decision processes, we show how improved estimation affects optimal allocation under scarcity. A synthetic triage simulation demonstrates that allocation-aware policies substantially outperform risk-threshold approaches in realised utility, even with identical predictive accuracy.

To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating 29 LLMs on object-oriented design (OOD) tasks. Owing to the lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics, we introduce OODEval, a manually constructed benchmark comprising 50 OOD tasks of varying difficulty, and OODEval-Human, the first human-rated OOD benchmark, which includes 940 undergraduate-submitted class diagrams evaluated by instructors. We further propose CLUE (Class Likeness Unified Evaluation), a unified metric set that assesses both global correctness and fine-grained design quality in class diagram generation. Using these benchmarks and metrics, we investigate five research questions: overall correctness, comparison with humans, model dimension analysis, task feature analysis, and bad case analysis. The results indicate that while LLMs achieve high syntactic accuracy, they exhibit substantial semantic deficiencies, particularly in method and relationship generation. Among the evaluated models, Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves the best overall performance, rivaling DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4o, while Gemma3-4B-IT outperforms GPT-4o-Mini despite its smaller parameter scale. Although top-performing LLMs nearly match the average performance of undergraduates, they remain significantly below the level of the best human designers. Further analysis shows that parameter scale, code specialization, and instruction tuning strongly influence performance, whereas increased design complexity and lower requirement readability degrade it.

Existing methods lack internal reasoning mechanisms that can identify task-relevant interaction cues or track progress within a subtask, leading to critical execution errors such as repeated actions, missed steps, and premature termination. To address these challenges, we introduce PALM, a VLA framework that structures policy learning around interaction-centric affordance reasoning and subtask progress cues. PALM distills complementary affordance representations that capture object relevance, contact geometry, spatial placements, and motion dynamics, and serve as task-relevant anchors for visuomotor control.

We introduce a Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to enable formal verifiability and optimization-based compliance correction. The LLM interprets statutes and enforcement cases to generate SMT constraints, while the solver enforces consistency and computes the minimal factual modification required to restore legality when penalties arise. Unlike transparency-oriented methods, our approach emphasizes logic-driven optimization, delivering verifiable, legally consistent reasoning rather than post-hoc explanation.

Recent work on adversarial attacks has revealed significant vulnerabilities in existing robot task planners, especially those built on foundation models. In this paper, we aim to address these security challenges by introducing PROTEA, an LLM-as-a-Judge defense mechanism, to evaluate the security of task plans. PROTEA is developed to address the dimensionality and history challenges in plan safety assessment. We used different LLMs to implement multiple versions of PROTEA for comparison purposes.

Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAPL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ECPL\u548cHECL\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u6076\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u7f18\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7be1\u6539\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u8fdc\u5927\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faSAPL\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "SAPL\u5229\u7528CLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning\uff08ECPL\uff09\u548cHierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning\uff08HECL\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fe1\u606f\u3002ECPL\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff1bHECL\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u7be1\u6539\u8fb9\u7f18\u533a\u57df\u7684\u533a\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSAPL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SAPL\uff08Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ECPL\u548cHECL\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "We present HERE, an active 3D scene reconstruction framework based on neural radiance fields, enabling high-fidelity implicit mapping. Our approach centers around an active learning strategy for camera trajectory generation, driven by accurate identification of unseen regions, which supports efficient data acquisition and precise scene reconstruction. The key to our approach is epistemic uncertainty quantification based on evidential deep learning, which directly captures data insufficiency and exhibits a strong correlation with reconstruction errors. This allows our framework to more reliably identify unexplored or poorly reconstructed regions compared to existing methods, leading to more informed and targeted exploration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical exploration strategy that leverages learned epistemic uncertainty, where local planning extracts target viewpoints from high-uncertainty voxels based on visibility for trajectory generation, and global planning uses uncertainty to guide large-scale coverage for efficient and comprehensive reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed method in active 3D reconstruction is demonstrated by achieving higher reconstruction completeness compared to previous approaches on photorealistic simulated scenes across varying scales, while a hardware demonstration further validates its real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERE\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u826f\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cHERE\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u6f14\u793a\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HERE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u6f14\u793a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range.

To answer this, we introduce GroupQA, a curated dataset of 1,635 controversial questions paired with 15,058 diversely-sourced evidence documents, annotated for stance and qualitative strength. Through controlled experiments, we characterize group-level evidence aggregation dynamics: Paraphrasing an argument can be more persuasive than providing distinct independent support; Models favor evidence presented first rather than last, and Larger models are increasingly resistant to adapt to presented evidence.

Existing solutions typically resort to training embodiment-specific models, which scales poorly and fails to exploit shared motion semantics. To address this, we present AdaMorph, a unified neural retargeting framework that enables a single model to adapt human motion to diverse robot morphologies. Our approach treats retargeting as a conditional generation task. We map human motion into a morphology-agnostic latent intent space and utilize a dual-purpose prompting mechanism to condition the generation. Instead of simple input concatenation, we leverage Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) to dynamically modulate the decoder's feature space based on embodiment constraints. Furthermore, we enforce physical plausibility through a curriculum-based training objective that ensures orientation and trajectory consistency via integration.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a conditional generative framework for synthesizing realistic Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave radar Range-Azimuth Maps.

Specifically, conditioning is achieved via Confidence Maps, where each channel represents a semantic class and encodes Gaussian-distributed annotations at target locations. To address radar-specific characteristics, we incorporate Geometry Aware Conditioning and Temporal Consistency Regularization into the generative process. Experiments on the ROD2021 dataset demonstrate that signal reconstruction quality improves by \\SI{3.6}{dB} in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio over baseline methods, while training with a combination of real and synthetic datasets improves overall mean Average Precision by 4.15% compared with conventional image-processing-based augmentation.

Traditional end-to-end learning approaches often struggle to handle the conflicting demands of these distinct phases. Navigation relies on robust decision-making over large spaces, while manipulation needs high sensitivity to fine local details. Forcing a single network to learn these different objectives simultaneously often causes optimization interference, where improving one task degrades the other. To address these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (HMER) framework tailored for autonomous forklifts. HMER decomposes long-horizon tasks into specialized sub-policies controlled by a Semantic Task Planner. This structure separates macro-level navigation from micro-level manipulation, allowing each expert to focus on its specific action space without interference. The planner coordinates the sequential execution of these experts, bridging the gap between task planning and continuous control. Furthermore, to solve the problem of sparse exploration, we introduce a Hybrid Imitation-Reinforcement Training Strategy. This method uses expert demonstrations to initialize the policy and Reinforcement Learning for fine-tuning. Experiments in Gazebo simulations show that HMER significantly outperforms sequential and end-to-end baselines.

For knowledge graph construction, we leverage the role-playing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform reasoning tasks. To enhance the quality of the generated knowledge, we incorporate a debate mechanism consisting of a proponent, an opponent, and a judge, which iteratively refines the outputs through feedback loops. We evaluate the dataset from multiple perspectives and conduct fine-tuning and ablation experiments using multiple LLM backbones to assess PCoKG's robustness and the effectiveness of its construction pipeline. Our LoRA-based fine-tuning results indicate a positive correlation between model performance and the parameter scale of the base models.

Yet, obtaining accurate near-surface measurements remains hazardous and logistically challenging, motivating the need for autonomous solutions.

We present a legged robotic system for autonomous volcanic gas analysis, utilizing the quadruped ANYmal, equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Our modular autonomy stack integrates a mission planning interface, global planner, localization framework, and terrain-aware local navigation.

Validation results on MPIIFaceGaze show comparable performance between both approaches prior to calibration, while lightweight user-specific fine-tuning consistently reduces gaze prediction error. We further evaluate EyeTheia in a realistic Dot-Probe task and compare it to the commercial webcam-based tracker SeeSo SDK. Results indicate strong agreement in left-right gaze allocation during stimulus presentation, despite higher temporal variability.

It includes a task creation engine that synthesizes long-horizon, multi-tool workflows with wild constraints, and a state controller that injects interruptions and failures to stress-test robustness. On top of this environment, we develop a tool select-then-execute agent framework with a planner-actor decomposition to separate deliberate reasoning and self-correction from step-wise execution. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals the misalignment between tool planning and execution abilities, the constraint following weakness of existing LLMs, and DeepSeek-v3.2's strongest robustness. Finally, we collect 1,170 trajectories from our environment to fine-tune LLMs, achieving superior performance to baselines using 119k samples, indicating the environment's value as both a realistic benchmark and a data engine for tool-using agents.

Our approach introduces a Two-Ways Splatting technique that accurately models the dual directions for intensity accumulation and transmittance calculation inherent in sonar imaging, significantly improving rendering speed without sacrificing quality. Moreover, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based noise model that captures complex sonar noise patterns, including side-lobes, speckle, and multi-path noise. This model enhances the realism of synthesized images while preventing 3D Gaussian overfitting to noise, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real-world large-scale offshore sonar scenarios, achieving superior results in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAS-GS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u58f0\u7eb3\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6e85\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u548cGMM\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf93D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdTwo-Ways Splatting\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u58f0\u7eb3\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5f3a\u5ea6\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u58f0\u7eb3\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "NAS-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "NAS-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u5cb8\u58f0\u7eb3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to this task, most existing frameworks rely on geometry-driven methods that require extensive preprocessing, suffer from information loss, and offer limited interpretability. This study proposes a methodology that evaluates manufacturability directly from parametric design features, enabling explicit incorporation of dimensional tolerances without requiring computer-aided design (CAD) processing. The approach employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn functional relationships between design parameters, tolerances, and manufacturability outcomes. A synthetic dataset of 300,000 labeled designs is generated to evaluate performance across three representative scenarios: hole drilling, pocket milling, and combined drilling-milling, while accounting for machining constraints and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) rules. Benchmarking against fourteen machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models shows that KAN achieves the highest performance in all scenarios, with AUC values of 0.9919 for drilling, 0.9841 for milling, and 0.9406 for the combined case. The proposed framework provides high interpretability through spline-based functional visualizations and latent-space projections, enabling identification of the design and tolerance parameters that most strongly influence manufacturability. An industrial case study further demonstrates how the framework enables iterative, parameter-level design modifications that transform a non-manufacturable component into a manufacturable one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eKAN\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e14\u79cdML/DL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528KANs\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u516c\u5dee\u548c\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0830\u4e07\u6807\u8bb0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u94bb\u5b54\u3001\u94e3\u524a\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "KAN\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u94bb\u5b54AUC 0.9919\uff0c\u94e3\u524a0.9841\uff0c\u7ec4\u54080.9406\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u6761\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold Networks\uff08KANs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700CAD\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing inherently supports privacy-preserving interaction, making it a promising modality for room-scale HRI. However, existing mmWave-based interaction-sensing systems exhibit poor spatial generalization at unseen distances or viewpoints. To address this challenge, we introduce WaveMan, a spatially adaptive room-scale perception system that restores reliable human interaction sensing across arbitrary user positions. WaveMan integrates viewpoint alignment and spectrogram enhancement for spatial consistency, with dual-channel attention for robust feature extraction. Experiments across five participants show that, under fixed-position evaluation, WaveMan achieves the same cross-position accuracy as the baseline with five times fewer training positions. In random free-position testing, accuracy increases from 33.00% to 94.33%, enabled by the proposed method.

In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models.

In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token.

Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality. Comprehensive ablations validate each component's contribution. FlyCo also serves as a flexible, extensible blueprint, readily leveraging future FM and robotics advances.

Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining.

Additionally, in-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting a pen into a writing posture after picking it up from a desk. We previously developed PLEXUS hand (Precision-Lateral dEXteroUS manipulation hand), a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand driven by four motors. This prosthetic performed reorientation between precision and lateral grasps with various objects. However, its controller required predefined object widths and was limited to handling lightweight objects (of weight up to 34 g). This study addresses these limitations by employing motor current feedback. Combined with the hand's previously optimized single-axis thumb, this approach achieves more stable manipulation by estimating the object's width and adjusting the index finger position to maintain stable object holding during the reorientation. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in a 100% success rate with lightweight objects and maintained a high success rate (>=80) even with heavy aluminum prisms (of weight up to 289 g). By contrast, the performance without index finger coordination dropped to just 40% on the heaviest 289 g prism. The hand also successfully executed several daily tasks, including closing bottle caps and orienting a pen for writing.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLEXUS\u624b\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u673a\u7535\u6d41\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u6293\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u8f7b\u91cd\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u65e5\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709PLEXUS\u624b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e14\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u8f7b\u7269\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7535\u673a\u7535\u6d41\u53cd\u9988\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5355\u8f74\u62c7\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u98df\u6307\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u624b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff085-30\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5706\u67f1\u548c\u68f1\u67f1\uff09\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u8f7b\u7269\u6210\u529f\u7387100%\uff0c\u91cd\u7269\uff08\u5982289\u514b\u94dd\u68f1\u67f1\uff09\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ecd\u226580%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u673a\u7535\u6d41\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5355\u8f74\u62c7\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cPLEXUS\u624b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u7269\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u65e5\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Second, to handle continuous and unpredictable student actions, we utilize the sliding temporal window technique to divide each student's 2-minute-long video into non-overlapping segments. Each segment is assigned an action category via the fine-tuned VLM model, generating a sequence of action predictions.

Inspired by cognitive theories, we propose HiMem, a hierarchical long-term memory framework for long-horizon dialogues, designed to support memory construction, retrieval, and dynamic updating during sustained interactions. HiMem constructs cognitively consistent Episode Memory via a Topic-Aware Event--Surprise Dual-Channel Segmentation strategy, and builds Note Memory that captures stable knowledge through a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. These two memory types are semantically linked to form a hierarchical structure that bridges concrete interaction events and abstract knowledge, enabling efficient retrieval without sacrificing information fidelity. HiMem supports both hybrid and best-effort retrieval strategies to balance accuracy and efficiency, and incorporates conflict-aware Memory Reconsolidation to revise and supplement stored knowledge based on retrieval feedback. This design enables continual memory self-evolution over long-term use. Experimental results on long-horizon dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that HiMem consistently outperforms representative baselines in accuracy, consistency, and long-term reasoning, while maintaining favorable efficiency. Overall, HiMem provides a principled and scalable design paradigm for building adaptive and self-evolving LLM-based conversational agents.

By training a single policy to perform multiple distinct motions across varied terrestrial features, we demonstrate the non-trivial benefit of integrating perception into the control loop.

Compared with image outpainting, it requires not only per-frame spatial plausibility but also long-range temporal coherence, especially when outpainted content becomes visible across time under camera or object motion. We propose GlobalPaint, a diffusion-based framework for spatiotemporal coherent video outpainting. Our approach adopts a hierarchical pipeline that first outpaints key frames and then completes intermediate frames via an interpolation model conditioned on the completed boundaries, reducing error accumulation in sequential processing. At the model level, we augment a pretrained image inpainting backbone with (i) an Enhanced Spatial-Temporal module featuring 3D windowed attention for stronger spatiotemporal interaction, and (ii) global feature guidance that distills OpenCLIP features from observed regions across all frames into compact global tokens using a dedicated extractor.

However, existing benchmarks are often constrained by pitfalls such as reliance on simulated or general-purpose samples and a focus on singular, offline static scenarios. Consequently, they fail to align with the requirements for authenticity and real-time responsiveness in financial services, leading to a significant discrepancy between benchmark performance and actual operational efficacy. To address this, we introduce BizFinBench.v2, the first large-scale evaluation benchmark grounded in authentic business data from both Chinese and U.S. equity markets, integrating online assessment. We performed clustering analysis on authentic user queries from financial platforms, resulting in eight fundamental tasks and two online tasks across four core business scenarios, totaling 29,578 expert-level Q&A pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-5 achieves a prominent 61.5% accuracy in main tasks, though a substantial gap relative to financial experts persists; in online tasks, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms all other commercial LLMs. Error analysis further identifies the specific capability deficiencies of existing models within practical financial business contexts. BizFinBench.v2 transcends the limitations of current benchmarks, achieving a business-level deconstruction of LLM financial capabilities and providing a precise basis for evaluating efficacy in the widespread deployment of LLMs within the financial domain.

However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \\textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \\textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \\textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \\textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets.

A Multi-Model Analysis of Self-Consistency Tradeoffs", "comment": "24 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables", "summary": "Self-consistency has emerged as a popular technique for improving large language model accuracy on reasoning tasks. The approach is straightforward: generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer through majority voting. While this reliably boosts accuracy, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect genuine improvements in reasoning quality. We investigate a fundamental question that has not been studied before: does inference scaling improve reasoning faithfulness?\n  We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across four frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash-preview, and DeepSeek-v3.2) on 100 GSM8K mathematical reasoning problems. Our analysis employs bootstrap confidence intervals, McNemar's tests for paired comparisons, and Cohen's d effect sizes to quantify the effects rigorously. The results reveal striking differences across models that challenge common assumptions about self-consistency.\n  GPT-5.2 shows the expected pattern: accuracy improves from 78% to 90% at N=5, with faithfulness remaining relatively stable (0.540 to 0.510). Claude Opus 4.5 tells a completely different story. Its accuracy actually drops from 78% to 74.3% while faithfulness jumps dramatically from 0.270 to 0.891 at N=5. DeepSeek-v3.2, already at 98% accuracy, shows ceiling effects with modest faithfulness gains (0.440 to 0.541). Gemini-3-flash improves from 81% to 86% accuracy with a slight faithfulness decrease (0.260 to 0.212).\n  Problem difficulty analysis reveals that GPT-5.2 solves 82% of hard problems while breaking only 13% of easy ones. Claude, in contrast, breaks 23% of easy problems, explaining its accuracy decrease. These findings matter for practitioners: self-consistency is not universally beneficial, and teams should test their specific models before deployment.

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in leveraging advances in computer vision to enable large-scale, systematic characterization of neighborhood built environments. However, the generalizability of vision models across fundamentally different domains remains uncertain, for example, transferring knowledge from ImageNet to the distinct visual characteristics of Google Street View (GSV) imagery. In applied fields such as social health research, several critical questions arise: which models are most appropriate, whether to adopt unsupervised training strategies, what training scale is feasible under computational constraints, and how much such strategies benefit downstream performance. These decisions are often costly and require specialized expertise.\n  In this paper, we answer these questions through empirical analysis and provide practical insights into how to select and adapt foundation models for datasets with limited size and labels, while leveraging larger, unlabeled datasets through unsupervised training. Our study includes comprehensive quantitative and visual analyses comparing model performance before and after unsupervised adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u793e\u533a\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u524d\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer.

However, these models often hallucinate details that are not present in the image to satisfy user prompts. While recent datasets and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate systematic hallucinations in VLMs, many hallucination behaviors remain insufficiently characterized. In particular, prior work primarily focuses on object presence or absence, leaving it unclear how prompt phrasing and structural constraints can systematically induce hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how different forms of prompt pressure influence hallucination behavior. We introduce Ghost-100, a procedurally generated dataset of synthetic scenes in which key visual details are deliberately removed, enabling controlled analysis of absence-based hallucinations. Using a structured 5-Level Prompt Intensity Framework, we vary prompts from neutral queries to toxic demands and rigid formatting constraints. We evaluate three representative open-weight VLMs: MiniCPM-V 2.6-8B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen3-VL-8B. Across all three models, hallucination rates do not increase monotonically with prompt intensity. All models exhibit reductions at higher intensity levels at different thresholds, though not all show sustained reduction under maximum coercion. These results suggest that current safety alignment is more effective at detecting semantic hostility than structural coercion, revealing model-specific limitations in handling compliance pressure.

However, accurately interpreting heterogeneous multimodal sensor data remains a fundamental challenge. We show that a single monolithic LLM often fails to reason coherently across modalities, leading to incomplete interpretations and prior-knowledge bias. We introduce ConSensus, a training-free multi-agent collaboration framework that decomposes multimodal sensing tasks into specialized, modality-aware agents. To aggregate agent-level interpretations, we propose a hybrid fusion mechanism that balances semantic aggregation, which enables cross-modal reasoning and contextual understanding, with statistical consensus, which provides robustness through agreement across modalities.

However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. Prior work in 2D VLMs has shown that the integration of visual inputs significantly increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks, making these models easier to manipulate into generating toxic or misleading outputs. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating 3D vision similarly compromises the robustness of 3D VLMs. To this end, we present the first systematic study of adversarial robustness in point-based 3D VLMs. We propose two complementary attack strategies: \\textit{Vision Attack}, which perturbs the visual token features produced by the 3D encoder and projector to assess the robustness of vision-language alignment; and \\textit{Caption Attack}, which directly manipulates output token sequences to evaluate end-to-end system robustness. Each attack includes both untargeted and targeted variants to measure general vulnerability and susceptibility to controlled manipulation. Our experiments reveal that 3D VLMs exhibit significant adversarial vulnerabilities under untargeted attacks, while demonstrating greater resilience against targeted attacks aimed at forcing specific harmful outputs, compared to their 2D counterparts.

This paper introduces the concept of AI Nativity, the capacity to integrate AI fluidly into everyday reasoning, problem solving, and decision making, and proposes the AI Pyramid, a conceptual framework for organizing human capability in an AI mediated economy. The framework distinguishes three interdependent capability layers: AI Native capability as a universal baseline for participation in AI augmented environments; AI Foundation capability for building, integrating, and sustaining AI enabled systems; and AI Deep capability for advancing frontier AI knowledge and applications. Crucially, the pyramid is not a career ladder but a system level distribution of capabilities required at scale. Building on this structure, the paper argues that effective AI workforce development requires treating capability formation as infrastructure rather than episodic training, centered on problem based learning embedded in work contexts and supported by dynamic skill ontologies and competency based measurement.

Despite significant progress in individual fields, there is still no method that can effectively integrate both paradigms. Conventional VLMs struggle with token explosion and limited spatiotemporal reasoning, while semantic occupancy provides a unified, explicit spatial representation but is too dense to integrate efficiently with VLMs. To address these challenges and bridge the gap between VLMs and occupancy, we propose SparseOccVLA, a novel vision-language-action model that unifies scene understanding, occupancy forecasting, and trajectory planning powered by sparse occupancy queries. Starting with a lightweight Sparse Occupancy Encoder, SparseOccVLA generates compact yet highly informative sparse occupancy queries that serve as the single bridge between vision and language.

However, their scalability and generalization remain limited, and their effectiveness diminishes as problem size increases, particularly in routing problems involving more than 30 nodes. We propose DRAGON, which stands for Decomposition and Reconstruction Agents Guided OptimizatioN, a novel framework that combines the strengths of metaheuristic design and LLM reasoning. Starting from an initial global solution, DRAGON autonomously identifies regions with high optimization potential and strategically decompose large-scale COPs into manageable subproblems. Each subproblem is then reformulated as a concise, localized optimization task and solved through targeted LLM prompting guided by accumulated experiences. Finally, the locally optimized solutions are systematically reintegrated into the original global context to yield a significantly improved overall outcome. By continuously interacting with the optimization environment and leveraging an adaptive experience memory, the agents iteratively learn from feedback, effectively coupling symbolic reasoning with heuristic search. Empirical results show that, unlike existing LLM-based solvers limited to small-scale instances, DRAGON consistently produces feasible solutions on TSPLIB, CVRPLIB, and Weibull-5k bin packing benchmarks, and achieves near-optimal results (0.16% gap) on knapsack problems with over 3M variables.

Measurements of wave signals from radio telescopes, called visibility, need to be transformed into images for astronomical observations. These dirty images blend information from real sources and artifacts. Therefore, astronomers usually perform reconstruction before imaging to obtain cleaner images. Existing methods consider only a single modality of sparse visibility data, resulting in images with remaining artifacts and insufficient modeling of correlation. To enhance the extraction of visibility information and emphasize output quality in the image domain, we propose VVTRec, a multimodal radio interferometric data reconstruction method with visibility-guided visual and textual modality enrichment. In our VVTRec, sparse visibility is transformed into image-form and text-form features to obtain enhancements in terms of spatial and semantic information, improving the structural integrity and accuracy of images. Also, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to achieve additional training-free performance improvements. VVTRec enables sparse visibility, as a foreign modality unseen by VLMs, to accurately extract pre-trained knowledge as a supplement.

To address this challenge, we propose 3D CoCa v2, a generalizable 3D captioning framework that unifies contrastive vision-language learning with 3D caption generation and further improves robustness via test-time search (TTS) without updating the captioner parameters. 3D CoCa v2 builds on a frozen CLIP-based semantic prior, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder for geometry, and a multimodal decoder jointly optimized with contrastive and captioning objectives, avoiding external detectors or handcrafted proposals. At inference, TTS produces diverse caption candidates and performs reward-guided selection using a compact scene summary.

While these advancements promise significant productivity gains, they also introduce critical safety risks that remain under-explored. Existing safety evaluations primarily focus on simple, daily assistance tasks, failing to capture the intricate decision-making processes and potential consequences of misaligned behaviors in professional settings. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{SafePro}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of AI agents performing professional activities. SafePro features a dataset of high-complexity tasks across diverse professional domains with safety risks, developed through a rigorous iterative creation and review process. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals significant safety vulnerabilities and uncovers new unsafe behaviors in professional contexts.

To support the needs of ever-changing object sets in such context, modern zero-shot object pose estimators were developed to not require object-specific training but only rely on CAD models. Such models are hard to obtain once deployed, and a continuously changing and growing set of objects makes it harder to reliably identify the instance model of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce an Open-Set CAD Retrieval from a Language Prompt and a Single Image (OSCAR), a novel training-free method that retrieves a matching object model from an unlabeled 3D object database. During onboarding, OSCAR generates multi-view renderings of database models and annotates them with descriptive captions using an image captioning model. At inference, GroundedSAM detects the queried object in the input image, and multi-modal embeddings are computed for both the Region-of-Interest and the database captions. OSCAR employs a two-stage retrieval: text-based filtering using CLIP identifies candidate models, followed by image-based refinement using DINOv2 to select the most visually similar object. In our experiments we demonstrate that OSCAR outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the cross-domain 3D model retrieval benchmark MI3DOR. Furthermore, we demonstrate OSCAR's direct applicability in automating object model sourcing for 6D object pose estimation. We propose using the most similar object model for pose estimation if the exact instance is not available and show that OSCAR achieves an average precision of 90.48\\% during object retrieval on the YCB-V object dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the most similar object model can be utilized for pose estimation using Megapose achieving better results than a reconstruction-based approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSCAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u96c6CAD\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e3D\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u548c6D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6CAD\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OSCAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "OSCAR\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8bc6\u522b\u5019\u9009\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7DINOv2\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "OSCAR\u5728YCB-V\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523090.48%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "OSCAR\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df3D\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6MI3DOR\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57286D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u76f8\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Conversely, traditional CNN-based baselines offer real-time inference but struggle with \"over-smoothing,\" failing to recover fine structural details in extreme low-light conditions. This creates a practical gap in the literature: the lack of a model that provides generative-level texture recovery at edge-deployable speeds. In this paper, we address this trade-off by proposing a hybrid Attention U-Net GAN. We demonstrate that the heavy iterative sampling of diffusion models is not strictly necessary for texture recovery. Instead, by integrating Attention Gates into a lightweight U-Net backbone and training within a conditional adversarial framework, we can approximate the high-frequency fidelity of generative models in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on the SID dataset show that our method achieves a best-in-class LPIPS score of 0.112 among efficient models, significantly outperforming efficient baselines (SID, EnlightenGAN) while maintaining an inference latency of 0.06s.

Laurent", "Patrick Sandoz"], "title": "FMAC: a Fair Fiducial Marker Accuracy Comparison Software", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents a method for carrying fair comparisons of the accuracy of pose estimation using fiducial markers. These comparisons rely on large sets of high-fidelity synthetic images enabling deep exploration of the 6 degrees of freedom. A low-discrepancy sampling of the space allows to check the correlations between each degree of freedom and the pose errors by plotting the 36 pairs of combinations. The images are rendered using a physically based ray tracing code that has been specifically developed to use the standard calibration coefficients of any camera directly. The software reproduces image distortions, defocus and diffraction blur. Furthermore, sub-pixel sampling is applied to sharp edges to enhance the fidelity of the rendered image.

We uncovered a crucial fact: state-of-the-art MLLMs consistently fail on basic visual tasks that humans, even 3-year-olds, can solve effortlessly. To systematically investigate this gap, we introduce BabyVision, a benchmark designed to assess core visual abilities independent of linguistic knowledge for MLLMs. BabyVision spans a wide range of tasks, with 388 items divided into 22 subclasses across four key categories. Empirical results and human evaluation reveal that leading MLLMs perform significantly below human baselines. Gemini3-Pro-Preview scores 49.7, lagging behind 6-year-old humans and falling well behind the average adult score of 94.1. These results show despite excelling in knowledge-heavy evaluations, current MLLMs still lack fundamental visual primitives. Progress in BabyVision represents a step toward human-level visual perception and reasoning capabilities. We also explore solving visual reasoning with generation models by proposing BabyVision-Gen and automatic evaluation toolkit.

Current automated chemical design methodologies focus mainly on various representations of process flow diagrams. However, transforming these diagrams into executable simulation flowsheets remains a time-consuming and labor-intensive endeavor, requiring extensive manual parameter configuration within simulation software. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent workflow that leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of large language models(LLMs) and enables iterative interactions with chemical process simulation software, achieving end-to-end automated simulation from textual process specifications to computationally validated software configurations for design enhancement. Our approach integrates four specialized agents responsible for task understanding, topology generation, parameter configuration, and evaluation analysis, respectively, coupled with Enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search to accurately interpret semantics and robustly generate configurations. Evaluated on Simona, a large-scale process description dataset, our method achieves a 31.1% improvement in the simulation convergence rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and reduces the design time by 89. 0% compared to the expert manual design. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted chemical process design, which bridges the gap between conceptual design and practical implementation.

Our analysis shows this limitation stems from two factors: datasets face an inherent trade-off between realism and coverage of diverse blur patterns, and algorithmic designs remain restrictive, as pixel-wise losses drive models toward local detail recovery while overlooking structural and semantic consistency, whereas diffusion-based approaches, though perceptually strong, still fail to generalize when trained on narrow datasets with simplistic strategies. Through systematic investigation, we identify blur pattern diversity as the decisive factor for robust generalization and propose Blur Pattern Pretraining (BPP), which acquires blur priors from simulation datasets and transfers them through joint fine-tuning on real data.

However, current methods often rely on static or offline critic models, which fail to adapt as the policy evolves. In on-policy RL, the agent's error patterns shift over time, causing stationary critics to become stale and providing feedback of diminishing utility. To address this, we introduce ECHO (Evolving Critic for Hindsight-Guided Optimization)}, a framework that jointly optimizes the policy and critic through a synchronized co-evolutionary loop. ECHO utilizes a cascaded rollout mechanism where the critic generates multiple diagnoses for an initial trajectory, followed by policy refinement to enable group-structured advantage estimation. We address the challenge of learning plateaus via a saturation-aware gain shaping objective, which rewards the critic for inducing incremental improvements in high-performing trajectories. By employing dual-track GRPO updates, ECHO ensures the critic's feedback stays synchronized with the evolving policy.

State-of-the-art methods demonstrate strong performance when trained and tested within the same domain. However, they struggle to generalise to new environments due to limited training data and depth perception -- overfitting to specific camera intrinsics. Our method addresses this by estimating keypoint z-coordinates in a virtual camera space, normalised by focal length and image size, enabling camera-agnostic depth prediction. We further leverage this invariance to camera intrinsics to propose a self-supervised test-time optimisation strategy that refines the model's depth perception during inference. This is achieved by applying a 3D consistency loss between predicted and in-space scale-transformed hand poses, allowing the model to adapt to target domain characteristics without requiring ground truth annotations. V-HPOT significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation performance in cross-domain scenarios, achieving a 71% reduction in mean pose error on the H2O dataset and a 41% reduction on the AssemblyHands dataset.

Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly the high-performance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, has emerged as a mainstream approach for this task. However, in ATP scenarios, GRPO faces two critical issues: when composite rewards are used, its relative advantage estimation may conflict with the binary feedback from the formal verifier; meanwhile, its static sampling strategy may discard entire batches of data if no valid proof is found, resulting in zero contribution to model updates and significant data waste. To address these limitations, we propose Group Dual-dynamic and Equal-right-advantage Policy Optimization (GDEPO), a method incorporating three core mechanisms: 1) dynamic additional sampling, which resamples invalid batches until a valid proof is discovered; 2) equal-right advantage, decoupling the sign of the advantage function (based on correctness) from its magnitude (modulated by auxiliary rewards) to ensure stable and correct policy updates; and 3) dynamic additional iterations, applying extra gradient steps to initially failed but eventually successful samples to accelerate learning on challenging cases. Experiments conducted on three datasets of varying difficulty (MinF2F-test, MathOlympiadBench, PutnamBench) confirm the effectiveness of GDEPO, while ablation studies validate the necessity of its synergistic components.

To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \\textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly employed for this task, existing approaches predominantly train models to associate events with timestamps in the forward video only. This paradigm hinders VLMs from capturing the inherent temporal structure and directionality of events, thereby limiting robustness and generalization. To address this limitation, inspired by the arrow of time in physics, which characterizes the intrinsic directionality of temporal processes, we propose ArrowGEV, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly models temporal directionality in events to improve both event grounding and temporal directionality understanding in VLMs. Specifically, we categorize events into time-sensitive (e.g., putting down a bag) and time-insensitive (e.g., holding a towel in the left hand). The former denote events whose reversal substantially alters their meaning, while the latter remain semantically unchanged under reversal. For time-sensitive events, ArrowGEV introduces a reward that encourages VLMs to discriminate between forward and backward videos, whereas for time-insensitive events, it enforces consistent grounding across both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArrowGEV not only improves grounding precision and temporal directionality recognition, but also enhances general video understanding and reasoning ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ArrowGEV\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u8054\u524d\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArrowGEV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9f13\u52b1\u533a\u5206\u524d\u540e\u5411\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u8de8\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eArrowGEV\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ArrowGEV\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success, it often suffers from high sample complexity, reward shaping difficulties, and produces opaque neural network policies that are hard to interpret or verify. Manual design, on the other hand, requires substantial domain expertise and struggles to scale across diverse tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary search can effectively synthesize interpretable control policies in the form of executable code. By treating policy synthesis as a code evolution problem, we harness the LLM's prior knowledge of programming patterns and control heuristics while employing evolutionary search to explore the solution space systematically. We implement our approach using EvoToolkit, a framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-driven evolution with customizable fitness evaluation. Our method iteratively evolves populations of candidate policy programs, evaluating them against task-specific objectives and selecting superior individuals for reproduction. This process yields compact, human-readable control policies that can be directly inspected, modified, and formally verified. This work highlights the potential of combining foundation models with evolutionary computation for synthesizing trustworthy control policies in autonomous systems.

Mediano"], "title": "A Brain-like Synergistic Core in LLMs Drives Behaviour and Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "The independent evolution of intelligence in biological and artificial systems offers a unique opportunity to identify its fundamental computational principles. Here we show that large language models spontaneously develop synergistic cores -- components where information integration exceeds individual parts -- remarkably similar to those in the human brain. Using principles of information decomposition across multiple LLM model families and architectures, we find that areas in middle layers exhibit synergistic processing while early and late layers rely on redundancy, mirroring the informational organisation in biological brains. This organisation emerges through learning and is absent in randomly initialised networks. Crucially, ablating synergistic components causes disproportionate behavioural changes and performance loss, aligning with theoretical predictions about the fragility of synergy. Moreover, fine-tuning synergistic regions through reinforcement learning yields significantly greater performance gains than training redundant components, yet supervised fine-tuning shows no such advantage. This convergence suggests that synergistic information processing is a fundamental property of intelligence, providing targets for principled model design and testable predictions for biological intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5927\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u7269\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u751f\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e2a\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u89e3\u539f\u7406\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e2d\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5904\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u534f\u540c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u534f\u540c\u533a\u57df\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence.

However, existing LLM-based agent training framework often focuses on answers' accuracy, overlooking specific alignment for behavior patterns. Consequently, agent often exhibits ineffective actions during TIR tasks, such as redundant and insufficient tool calls. How to calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns when executing TIR tasks, thereby exploring effective trajectories, remains an open-ended problem. In this paper, we propose ET-Agent, a training framework for calibrating agent's tool-use behavior through two synergistic perspectives: Self-evolving Data Flywheel and Behavior Calibration Training. Specifically, we introduce a self-evolutionary data flywheel to generate enhanced data, used to fine-tune LLM to improve its exploration ability. Based on this, we implement an two-phases behavior-calibration training framework. It is designed to progressively calibrate erroneous behavioral patterns to optimal behaviors. Further in-depth experiments confirm the superiority of \\ourmodel{} across multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, reasoning conciseness, and tool execution accuracy.

Accurate organoid instance segmentation is critical for quantifying their dynamic behaviors, yet remains profoundly limited by high-quality annotated datasets and pervasive overlap in microscopy imaging. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to alleviate reliance on scarce labeled data, conventional SSL frameworks suffer from biases induced by noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in overlapping regions. Synthesis-assisted SSL (SA-SSL) has been proposed for mitigating training biases in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. We present the first adaptation of SA-SSL to organoid instance segmentation and reveal that SA-SSL struggles to disentangle intertwined organoids, often misrepresenting overlapping instances as a single entity. To overcome this, we propose Pseudo-Label Unmixing (PLU), which identifies erroneous pseudo-labels for overlapping instances and then regenerates organoid labels through instance decomposition. For image synthesis, we apply a contour-based approach to synthesize organoid instances efficiently, particularly for overlapping cases. Instance-level augmentations (IA) on pseudo-labels before image synthesis further enhances the effect of synthetic data (SD). Rigorous experiments on two organoid datasets demonstrate our method's effectiveness, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised models using only 10% labeled data, and state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies validate the contributions of PLU, contour-based synthesis, and augmentation-aware training.

While large language models show considerable promise for mental health support, their predominantly Western-centric training data limit cultural and linguistic applicability in African contexts. This study introduces a proof-of-concept framework that integrates cognitive behavioral therapy with the African philosophy of Ubuntu to create a culturally sensitive, emotionally intelligent, AI-driven mental health dialogue system. Guided by a design science research methodology, the framework applies both deep theoretical and therapeutic adaptations as well as surface-level linguistic and communicative cultural adaptations. Key CBT techniques, including behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, were reinterpreted through Ubuntu principles that emphasize communal well-being, spiritual grounding, and interconnectedness. A culturally adapted dataset was developed through iterative processes of language simplification, spiritual contextualization, and Ubuntu-based reframing. The fine-tuned model was evaluated through expert-informed case studies, employing UniEval for conversational quality assessment alongside additional measures of CBT reliability and cultural linguistic alignment. Results demonstrate that the model effectively engages in empathetic, context-aware dialogue aligned with both therapeutic and cultural objectives. Although real-time end-user testing has not yet been conducted, the model underwent rigorous review and supervision by domain specialist clinical psychologists. The findings highlight the potential of culturally embedded emotional intelligence to enhance the contextual relevance, inclusivity, and effectiveness of AI-driven mental health interventions across African settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408Ubuntu\u54f2\u5b66\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u7597\u6cd5\u7684AI\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5357\u975e\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5371\u673a\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u62a4\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5f53\u5730\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9002\u5e94\u4ee5\u53ca\u8868\u5c42\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5bcc\u6709\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u6587\u5316\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u63d0\u5347AI\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u6d32Ubuntu\u54f2\u5b66\u7684\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611fAI\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Benchmarking SDTrack (spiking transformer) against STARK (RGB transformer), we find that event-based tracking is substantially resilient to broadcast clutter in scenes dominated by static overlays, achieving 0.685 IoU, outperforming RGB by +20.0 points.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression, neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies. Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues: (1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the desired area, and (2) uniform modeling the target UI element fails to distinguish between its center and edges, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.

This work presents a unified framework leveraging vision foundation models to automate the quantification and classification of CNTs in electron microscopy images. First, we introduce an interactive quantification tool built on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that segments particles with near-perfect accuracy using minimal user input. Second, we propose a novel classification pipeline that utilizes these segmentation masks to spatially constrain a DINOv2 vision transformer, extracting features exclusively from particle regions while suppressing background noise. Evaluated on a dataset of 1,800 TEM images, this architecture achieves 95.5% accuracy in distinguishing between four different CNT morphologies, significantly outperforming the current baseline despite using a fraction of the training data. Crucially, this instance-level processing allows the framework to resolve mixed samples, correctly classifying distinct particle types co-existing within a single field of view.

However, in forensic applications, a human expert may be needed to review and confirm a positive identification before an iris matching result can be presented as evidence in court, especially in cases where processed samples are degraded (e.g., in post-mortem cases) or where there is a need to judge whether the sample is authentic, rather than a result of a presentation attack.\n  This paper presents a study that examines human performance in iris verification in two controlled scenarios: (a) under varying pupil sizes, with and without a linear/nonlinear alignment of the pupil size between compared images, and (b) when both genuine and impostor iris image pairs are synthetically generated. The results demonstrate that pupil size normalization carried out by a modern autoencoder-based identity-preserving image-to-image translation model significantly improves verification accuracy. Participants were also able to determine whether iris pairs corresponded to the same or different eyes when both images were either authentic or synthetic. However, accuracy declined when subjects were comparing authentic irises against high-quality, same-eye synthetic counterparts. These findings (a) demonstrate the importance of pupil-size alignment for iris matching tasks in which humans are involved, and (b) indicate that despite the high fidelity of modern generative models, same-eye synthetic iris images are more often judged by humans as different-eye images, compared to same-eye authentic image pairs.\n  We offer data and human judgments along with this paper to allow full replicability of this study and future works.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9000\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5224\u65ad\u6837\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u53d7\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8679\u819c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a(a) \u4e0d\u540c\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709/\u65e0\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u7ebf\u6027/\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(b) \u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5192\u540d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u8679\u819c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u77b3\u5b54\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u8679\u819c\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u773c\u5408\u6210\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u5e38\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bef\u5224\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u773c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

We propose a novel framework for supervised LLM uncertainty quantification, learning a dedicated meta-model based on LLM Performance Predictors (LPPs) derived from LLM outputs: log-probabilities, entropy, and novel uncertainty attribution indicators. We demonstrate that our method enables cost-aware selective classification in real-world human-AI workflows: escalating high-risk cases while automating the rest. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, including both off-the-shelf (Gemini, GPT) and open-source (Llama, Qwen), on multimodal and multilingual moderation tasks, show significant improvements over existing uncertainty estimators in accuracy-cost trade-offs.

This approach allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate and solve complex problems, thereby improving their reasoning capabilities. However, multi-turn search agents struggle in data-free self-evolution due to the limited question diversity and the substantial compute required for multi-step reasoning and tool using. In this work, we introduce Dr. Zero, a framework enabling search agents to effectively self-evolve without any training data. In particular, we design a self-evolution feedback loop where a proposer generates diverse questions to train a solver initialized from the same base model. As the solver evolves, it incentivizes the proposer to produce increasingly difficult yet solvable tasks, thus establishing an automated curriculum to refine both agents. To enhance training efficiency, we also introduce hop-grouped relative policy optimization (HRPO).

In this work, we challenge this paradigm by returning to mathematical first principles. We propose the \\textbf{Clifford Algebra Network (CAN)}, also referred to as CliffordNet, a vision backbone grounded purely in Geometric Algebra. Instead of engineering separate modules for mixing and memory, we derive a unified interaction mechanism based on the \\textbf{Clifford Geometric Product} ($uv = u \\cdot v + u \\wedge v$). This operation ensures algebraic completeness regarding the Geometric Product by simultaneously capturing feature coherence (via the generalized inner product) and structural variation (via the exterior wedge product).\n  Implemented via an efficient sparse rolling mechanism with \\textbf{strict linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$}, our model reveals a surprising emergent property: the geometric interaction is so representationally dense that standard Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) become redundant.

To tackle these challenges, this research introduces an innovative approach for constructing Domain Question Maps (DQMs), rather than traditional concept maps.

This leads to substantial computational overhead with limited performance gain, primarily due to redundant verification and repetitive generation. While prior work typically constrains output length or optimizes correctness, such coarse supervision fails to guide models toward concise yet accurate inference. In this paper, we propose ENTRA, an entropy-based training framework that suppresses redundant reasoning while preserving performance. ENTRA first estimates the token-level importance using a lightweight Bidirectional Importance Estimation (BIE) method, which accounts for both prediction confidence and forward influence. It then computes a redundancy reward based on the entropy of low-importance tokens, normalized by its theoretical upper bound, and optimizes this reward via reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ENTRA reduces output length by 37% to 53% with no loss-and in some cases, gains-in accuracy.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution but faces two critical obstacles: designing reliable reward signals for subjective storytelling quality and mitigating training instability. This paper introduces the Reinforcement Learning for Creative Storytelling (RLCS) framework to systematically address both challenges. First, we develop a Generative Reward Model (GenRM) that provides multi-dimensional analysis and explicit reasoning about story preferences, trained through supervised fine-tuning on demonstrations with reasoning chains distilled from strong teacher models, followed by GRPO-based refinement on expanded preference data. Second, we introduce an entropy-based reward shaping strategy that dynamically prioritizes learning on confident errors and uncertain correct predictions, preventing overfitting on already-mastered patterns. Experiments demonstrate that GenRM achieves 68\\% alignment with human creativity judgments, and RLCS significantly outperforms strong baselines including Gemini-2.5-Pro in overall story quality.

However, unlocking their full potential requires developing high-performance compute kernels using vendor-specific Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), a task that demands deep hardware expertise and is labor-intensive. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general code generation, they struggle with the strict constraints and scarcity of training data in the NPU domain. Our preliminary study reveals that state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs fail to generate functional complex kernels for Ascend NPUs, yielding a near-zero success rate. To address these challenges, we propose AscendKernelGen, a generation-evaluation integrated framework for NPU kernel development. We introduce Ascend-CoT, a high-quality dataset incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning derived from real-world kernel implementations, and KernelGen-LM, a domain-adaptive model trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with execution feedback. Furthermore, we design NPUKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing compilation, correctness, and performance across varying complexity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly bridges the gap between general LLMs and hardware-specific coding. Specifically, the compilation success rate on complex Level-2 kernels improves from 0% to 95.5% (Pass@10), while functional correctness achieves 64.3% compared to the baseline's complete failure.

Current approaches are often hindered by the inherent speckle noise and geometric distortions of SAR data, which frequently result in semantic misinterpretation, ambiguous texture synthesis, and structural hallucinations. To address these limitations, a novel SAR-to-Optical (S2O) translation framework is proposed, integrating three core technical contributions: (i) Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment, which establishes an Optical-Aware SAR Encoder by distilling robust semantic priors from an Optical Teacher into a SAR Student (ii) Semantically-Grounded Generative Guidance, realized by a Semantically-Grounded ControlNet that integrates class-aware text prompts for global context with hierarchical visual prompts for local spatial guidance; and (iii) an Uncertainty-Aware Objective, which explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty to dynamically modulate the reconstruction focus, effectively mitigating artifacts caused by speckle-induced ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cdSAR-to-Optical\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SAR\u6570\u636e\u56e0\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8bef\u89e3\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\uff1a(i) \u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5411SAR\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f20\u9012\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b(ii) \u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840ControlNet\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b(iii) \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u91cd\u5efa\u7126\u70b9\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SAR-to-Optical\uff08S2O\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Focus, an agent-centric architecture inspired by the biological exploration strategies of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). The Focus Agent autonomously decides when to consolidate key learnings into a persistent \"Knowledge\" block and actively withdraws (prunes) the raw interaction history. Using an optimized scaffold matching industry best practices (persistent bash + string-replacement editor), we evaluated Focus on N=5 context-intensive instances from SWE-bench Lite using Claude Haiku 4.5. With aggressive prompting that encourages frequent compression, Focus achieves 22.7% token reduction (14.9M -> 11.5M tokens) while maintaining identical accuracy (3/5 = 60% for both agents). Focus performed 6.0 autonomous compressions per task on average, with token savings up to 57% on individual instances.

Recent streaming methods reduce latency by interleaving perception and generation, but still enforce a sequential perception-generation cycle, limiting real-time interaction. In this work, we target a fundamental bottleneck that arises when extending MLLMs to real-time video understanding: the global positional continuity constraint imposed by standard positional encoding schemes. While natural in offline inference, this constraint tightly couples perception and generation, preventing effective input-output parallelism. To address this limitation, we propose a parallel streaming framework that relaxes positional continuity through three designs: Overlapped, Group-Decoupled, and Gap-Isolated. These designs enable simultaneous perception and generation, allowing the model to process incoming inputs while producing responses in real time. Extensive experiments reveal that Group-Decoupled achieves the best efficiency-performance balance, maintaining high fluency and accuracy while significantly reducing latency.

Current data arbitration strategies often rely on surface-level heuristics that fail to diagnose intrinsic learning needs. Since SFT targets pattern consolidation through imitation while RL drives structural adaptation via exploration, misaligning data with these functional roles causes severe optimization interference. We propose PRISM, a dynamics-aware framework grounded in Schema Theory that arbitrates data based on its degree of cognitive conflict with the model's existing knowledge. By analyzing the spatial geometric structure of gradients, PRISM identifies data triggering high spatial concentration as high-conflict signals that require RL for structural restructuring. In contrast, data yielding diffuse updates is routed to SFT for efficient consolidation. Extensive experiments on WebShop and ALFWorld demonstrate that PRISM achieves a Pareto improvement, outperforming state-of-the-art hybrid methods while reducing computational costs by up to 3.22$\\times$.

We posit this limitation arises from the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale clinical referring-localization pairs. To address this, we introduce MedGround, an automated pipeline that transforms segmentation resources into high-quality medical referring grounding data. Leveraging expert masks as spatial anchors, MedGround precisely derives localization targets, extracts shape and spatial cues, and guides VLMs to synthesize natural, clinically grounded queries that reflect morphology and location. To ensure data rigor, a multi-stage verification system integrates strict formatting checks, geometry- and medical-prior rules, and image-based visual judging to filter out ambiguous or visually unsupported samples. Finally, we present MedGround-35K, a novel multimodal medical dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMs trained with MedGround-35K consistently achieve improved referring grounding performance, enhance multi-object semantic disambiguation, and exhibit strong generalization to unseen grounding settings.

However, this shift introduces input contexts that are inherently noisy, a reality that current sanitized benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce NoisyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates model robustness across 11 datasets in RAG, reasoning, alignment, and tool-use tasks against diverse noise types, including random documents, irrelevant chat histories, and hard negative distractors. Our evaluation reveals a catastrophic performance drop of up to 80% in state-of-the-art models when faced with contextual distractors. Crucially, we find that agentic workflows often amplify these errors by over-trusting noisy tool outputs, and distractors can trigger emergent misalignment even without adversarial intent. We find that prompting, context engineering, SFT, and outcome-reward only RL fail to ensure robustness; in contrast, our proposed Rationale-Aware Reward (RARE) significantly strengthens resilience by incentivizing the identification of helpful information within noise. Finally, we uncover an inverse scaling trend where increased test-time computation leads to worse performance in noisy settings and demonstrate via attention visualization that models disproportionately focus on distractor tokens, providing vital insights for building the next generation of robust, reasoning-capable agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "NoisyBench\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRARE\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u5411\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u667a\u80fdAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165NoisyBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6RAG\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u6587\u6863\u3001\u65e0\u5173\u804a\u5929\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001SFT\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800cRARE\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRationale-Aware Reward (RARE)\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u7f29\u653e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9c81\u68d2\u63a8\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES.

Existing multimodal or prompting-based models generate explanations for humor but operate in an open loop,lacking the ability to critique or refine their reasoning once a prediction is made. We propose FLoReNce, an agentic feedback reasoning framework that treats meme understanding as a closed-loop process during learning and an open-loop process during inference. In the closed loop, a reasoning agent is critiqued by a judge; the error and semantic feedback are converted into control signals and stored in a feedback-informed, non-parametric knowledge base. At inference, the model retrieves similar judged experiences from this KB and uses them to modulate its prompt, enabling better, self-aligned reasoning without finetuning.

As large language models move into real-world deployment, this ideal has been imported wholesale into inference stacks. Recent work from the Thinking Machines Lab has presented a detailed analysis of nondeterminism in LLM inference, showing how batch-invariant kernels and deterministic attention can enforce bitwise-identical outputs, positioning deterministic inference as a prerequisite for reproducibility and enterprise reliability.\n  In this paper, we take the opposite stance. We argue that, for LLMs, deterministic inference kills. It kills the ability to model uncertainty, suppresses emergent abilities, collapses reasoning into a single brittle path, and weakens safety alignment by hiding tail risks. LLMs implement conditional distributions over outputs, not fixed functions. Collapsing these distributions to a single canonical completion may appear reassuring, but it systematically conceals properties central to artificial cognition. We instead advocate Stochastic CHAOS, treating distributional variability as a signal to be measured and controlled.\n  Empirically, we show that deterministic inference is systematically misleading. Single-sample deterministic evaluation underestimates both capability and fragility, masking failure probability under paraphrases and noise. Phase-like transitions associated with emergent abilities disappear under greedy decoding. Multi-path reasoning degrades when forced onto deterministic backbones, reducing accuracy and diagnostic insight. Finally, deterministic evaluation underestimates safety risk by hiding rare but dangerous behaviors that appear only under multi-sample evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u53cd\u5bf9LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff08Stochastic CHAOS\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63a9\u76d6\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u524a\u5f31\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u9a73\u5f53\u524dLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u53ca\u9690\u85cf\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u4f4e\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a9\u76d6\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u4f4e\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63a9\u76d6\u5931\u8d25\u6982\u7387\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9690\u85cf\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5371\u9669\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff08Stochastic CHAOS\uff09\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4f1a\u63a9\u76d6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u524a\u5f31\u6d8c\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u9650\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u9690\u85cf\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, a few methods predominantly focus on single-modal RGB features, neglecting the inherent correlation between scene depth and haze distribution. Even those that jointly optimize depth estimation and image dehazing often suffer from suboptimal performance due to inadequate utilization of accurate depth information. In this paper, we present UDPNet, a general framework that leverages depth-based priors from large-scale pretrained depth estimation model DepthAnything V2 to boost existing image dehazing models. Specifically, our architecture comprises two typical components: the Depth-Guided Attention Module (DGAM) adaptively modulates features via lightweight depth-guided channel attention, and the Depth Prior Fusion Module (DPFM) enables hierarchical fusion of multi-scale depth map features by dual sliding-window multi-head cross-attention mechanism. These modules ensure both computational efficiency and effective integration of depth priors. Moreover, the intrinsic robustness of depth priors empowers the network to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities, illumination conditions, and domain gaps across synthetic and real-world data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our UDPNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on popular dehazing datasets, such as 0.85 dB PSNR improvement on the SOTS dataset, 1.19 dB on the Haze4K dataset and 1.79 dB PSNR on the NHR dataset.

We introduce a Multi-Model Consensus Reasoning Engine that treats the set of LLM outputs as input to a supervised meta-learner. The system maps natural language responses into structured features using semantic embeddings, pairwise similarity and clustering statistics, lexical and structural cues, reasoning-quality scores, confidence estimates, and model-specific priors, and then applies gradient-boosted trees, listwise ranking, and graph neural networks over similarity graphs of answers. Using three open-weight LLMs evaluated on compact, resource- constrained subsets of GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA, our best graph-attention-based consensus model improves macro-average accuracy by 4.6 percentage points over the strongest single LLM and by 8.1 points over majority vote, while also yielding lower Brier scores and fewer TruthfulQA hal- lucinations. Ablation and feature-importance analyses show that semantic agreement and clustering features are most influential, with reasoning-quality and model-prior features providing com- plementary gains, suggesting supervised multi-model consensus is a practical route toward more reliable LLM behavior, even in a modest single-machine setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8106\u5f31\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u826f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u54cd\u5e94\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u3001\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86Brier\u5206\u6570\u548cTruthfulQA\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u8bc6\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5355\u673a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although recent deep learning approaches leverage diffusion model priors with geometry buffers (G-buffers) to produce visually compelling results without explicit scene geometry or light simulation, they remain constrained by two major limitations. First, the iterative nature of the diffusion process introduces substantial latency. Second, the inherent stochasticity of these generative models compromises physical accuracy and temporal consistency. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel, end-to-end, deterministic, single-step neural rendering framework, RenderFlow, built upon a flow matching paradigm. To further strengthen both rendering quality and generalization, we propose an efficient and effective module for sparse keyframe guidance. Our method significantly accelerates the rendering process and, by optionally incorporating sparsely rendered keyframes as guidance, enhances both the physical plausibility and overall visual quality of the output. The resulting pipeline achieves near real-time performance with photorealistic rendering quality, effectively bridging the gap between the efficiency of modern generative models and the precision of traditional physically based rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework by introducing a lightweight, adapter-based module that efficiently repurposes the pretrained forward model for the inverse rendering task of intrinsic decomposition.", "AI": {"tldr": "RenderFlow \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf PBR \u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf PBR \u7ba1\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8303\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u7684 RenderFlow \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "RenderFlow \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "RenderFlow \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5355\u6b65\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Agent-Role Merging (ARM), an activation-guided, role-conditioned neuron transplantation method for model merging in LLM agents. ARM improves existing merging methods from static natural language tasks to multi-turn agent scenarios, and over the generalization ability across various interactive environments. This is achieved with a well designed 3-step framework: 1) constructing merged backbones, 2) selection based on its role-conditioned activation analysis, and 3) neuron transplantation for fine-grained refinements. Without gradient-based optimization, ARM improves cross-benchmark generalization while enjoying efficiency. Across diverse domains, the model obtained via ARM merging outperforms prior model merging methods and domain-specific expert models, while demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u79fb\u690d\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u4ee3\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1)\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u5e76\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c2)\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0c3)\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u79fb\u690d\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "ARM\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ARM\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u6761\u4ef6\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u79fb\u690d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ee3\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, how to compare and evaluate human and AI intelligence has become an important theoretical issue. However, existing definitions of intelligence are anthropocentric and unsuitable for empirical comparison, resulting in a lack of consensus in the research field.\n  This paper first introduces four criteria for evaluating intelligence definitions based on R. Carnap's methodology of conceptual clarification: similarity to explicandum, exactness, fruitfulness, and simplicity. We then examine six representative definitions: IQ testing, complex problem-solving ability, reward optimization, environmental adaptation, learning efficiency, and predictive ability, and clarify their theoretical strengths and limitations.\n  The results show that while definitions based on predictive ability have high explanatory power and empirical feasibility, they suffer from an inability to adequately explain the relationship between predictions and behavior/benefits. This paper proposes the Extended Predictive Hypothesis (EPH), which views intelligence as a combination of the ability to accurately predict the future and the ability to benefit from those predictions. Furthermore, by distinguishing predictive ability into spontaneous and reactive predictions and adding the concept of gainability, we present a unified framework for explaining various aspects of intelligence, such as creativity, learning, and future planning. In conclusion, this paper argues that the EPH is the most satisfactory and universal definition for comparing human and AI intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u5047\u8bf4\uff08EPH\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u589e\u76ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u667a\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8eR.

Recent personalized unified models introduce learnable soft prompts to encode concept information, yet they either couple understanding and generation or depend on complex multi-stage training, leading to cross-task interference and ultimately to fuzzy or misaligned personalized knowledge. We present \\textbf{OmniPersona}, an end-to-end personalization framework for unified LMMs that, for the first time, integrates personalized understanding, generation, and image editing within a single architecture. OmniPersona introduces structurally decoupled concept tokens, allocating dedicated subspaces for different tasks to minimize interference, and incorporates an explicit knowledge replay mechanism that propagates personalized attribute knowledge across tasks, enabling consistent personalized behavior. To systematically evaluate unified personalization, we propose \\textbf{\\texttt{OmniPBench}}, extending the public UnifyBench concept set with personalized editing tasks and cross-task evaluation protocols integrating understanding, generation, and editing.

A widely adopted strategy for boosting performance on challenging tasks such as math and coding is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, several prior works have reported that CoT can actually harm performance on visual perception tasks. These studies, though, examine the issue from relatively narrow angles and leave open why CoT degrades perception-heavy performance. We systematically re-examine the role of CoT in FGVC through the lenses of zero-shot evaluation and multiple training paradigms. Across these settings, we uncover a central paradox: the degradation induced by CoT is largely driven by the reasoning length, in which longer textual reasoning consistently lowers classification accuracy. We term this phenomenon the ``Cost of Thinking''. Building on this finding, we make two key contributions: (1) \\alg, a simple and general plug-and-play normalization method for multi-reward optimization that balances heterogeneous reward signals, and (2) ReFine-RFT, a framework that combines ensemble rewards with \\alg to constrain reasoning length while providing dense accuracy-oriented feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our findings and the proposed ReFine-RFT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across FGVC benchmarks.

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements.

Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enables non-invasive tumor characterization, clinical workflows typically acquire only single-phase post-contrast images to reduce scan time and contrast agent dose. In this study, we propose a spatial multi-task learning framework for breast cancer molecular subtype prediction from clinically practical single-phase DCE-MRI. The framework simultaneously predicts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and the Ki-67 proliferation index -- biomarkers that collectively define molecular subtypes. The architecture integrates a deep feature extraction network with multi-scale spatial attention to capture intratumoral and peritumoral characteristics, together with a region-of-interest weighting module that emphasizes the tumor core, rim, and surrounding tissue. Multi-task learning exploits biological correlations among biomarkers through shared representations with task-specific prediction branches. Experiments on a dataset of 960 cases (886 internal cases split 7:1:2 for training/validation/testing, and 74 external cases evaluated via five-fold cross-validation) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 0.893, 0.824, and 0.857 for ER, PR, and HER2 classification, respectively, and a mean absolute error of 8.2\\% for Ki-67 regression, significantly outperforming radiomics and single-task deep learning baselines. These results indicate the feasibility of accurate, non-invasive molecular subtype prediction using standard imaging protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76f8DCE-MRI\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u5206\u5b50\u4e9a\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6d3b\u68c0\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u91c7\u6837\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8aDCE-MRI\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u83b7\u53d6\u5355\u76f8\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u4e9a\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4bER\u3001PR\u3001HER2\u72b6\u6001\u548cKi-67\u589e\u6b96\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u652f\u5229\u7528\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728960\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ER\u3001PR\u548cHER2\u5206\u7c7b\u7684AUC\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.893\u30010.824\u548c0.857\uff0cKi-67\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a8.2%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5355\u76f8DCE-MRI\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u5206\u5b50\u4e9a\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u4e9a\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.

While prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance LLM reasoning abilities to some extent, they often suffer from a lack of faithfulness, where the derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches to bolster LLM logical reasoning capabilities. However, existing neuro-symbolic methods still face challenges with information loss during the process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Iterative Feedback-Driven Neuro-Symbolic (IFDNS), a novel prompt-based method that employs a multi-round feedback mechanism to address LLM limitations in handling complex logical relationships. IFDNS utilizes iterative feedback during the logic extraction phase to accurately extract causal relationship statements and translate them into propositional and logical implication expressions, effectively mitigating information loss issues. Furthermore, IFDNS is orthogonal to existing prompt methods, allowing for seamless integration with various prompting approaches. Empirical evaluations across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IFDNS in significantly improving the performance of CoT and Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency (CoT-SC).

However, existing methods fail to properly model the temporal dimension of memory in two aspects: 1) Temporal inaccuracy: memories are organized by dialogue time rather than their actual occurrence time; 2) Temporal fragmentation: existing methods focus on point-wise memory, losing durative information that captures persistent states and evolving patterns. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal Semantic Memory (TSM), a memory framework that models semantic time for point-wise memory and supports the construction and utilization of durative memory. During memory construction, it first builds a semantic timeline rather than a dialogue one. Then, it consolidates temporally continuous and semantically related information into a durative memory. During memory utilization, it incorporates the query's temporal intent on the semantic timeline, enabling the retrieval of temporally appropriate durative memories and providing time-valid, duration-consistent context to support response generation.

Currently, a paramount concern for VQA in this domain is the stringent requirement for fast latency and real-time processing, as delays directly impact real-world safety in this safety-critical application. However, current state-of-the-art VQA models, particularly large vision-language models (VLMs), often prioritize performance over computational efficiency. These models typically process dense patch tokens for every frame, leading to prohibitive computational costs (FLOPs) and significant inference latency, especially with long video sequences. This focus limits their practical deployment in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient VLM framework for autonomous driving VQA tasks, SRC-Pipeline. It learns to compress early frame tokens into a small number of high-level tokens while retaining full patch tokens for recent frames.

Although diffusion models have demonstrated strong denoising capability, their stochastic nature makes it challenging to enforce anatomically consistent structures, particularly in low signal-to-noise regimes and volumetric whole-body imaging. We propose Wavelet-Conditioned ControlNet (WCC-Net), a fully 3D diffusion-based framework that introduces explicit frequency-domain structural priors via wavelet representations to guide volumetric PET denoising. By injecting wavelet-based structural guidance into a frozen pretrained diffusion backbone through a lightweight control branch, WCC-Net decouples anatomical structure from noise while preserving generative expressiveness and 3D structural continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WCC-Net consistently outperforms CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based baselines.

This paper proposes the Meta-Cognitive Memory Abstraction method (MCMA), which treats memory abstraction as a learnable cognitive skill rather than a fixed design choice. MCMA decouples task execution from memory management by combining a frozen task model with a learned memory copilot. The memory copilot is trained using direct preference optimization, it determines how memories should be structured, abstracted, and reused. Memories are further organized into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, enabling selective reuse based on task similarity.

Medical VLMs often rely on static visual embeddings and single-pass inference, preventing models from re-examining, verifying, or refining visual evidence during reasoning. While tool-integrated reasoning offers a promising path forward, open-source VLMs lack the training infrastructure to learn effective tool selection, invocation, and coordination in multi-modal medical reasoning. We introduce MedVistaGym, a scalable and interactive training environment that incentivizes tool-integrated visual reasoning for medical image analysis. MedVistaGym equips VLMs to determine when and which tools to invoke, localize task-relevant image regions, and integrate single or multiple sub-image evidence into interleaved multimodal reasoning within a unified, executable interface for agentic training. Using MedVistaGym, we train MedVistaGym-R1 to interleave tool use with agentic reasoning through trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning.

This work proposes a generative co-memory regularization approach to facilitate FSCIL. In the approach, the base learning leverages generative domain adaptation finetuning to finetune a pretrained generative encoder on a few examples of base classes by jointly incorporating a masked autoencoder (MAE) decoder for feature reconstruction and a fully-connected classifier for feature classification, which enables the model to efficiently capture general and adaptable representations. Using the finetuned encoder and learned classifier, we construct two class-wise memories: representation memory for storing the mean features for each class, and weight memory for storing the classifier weights. After that, the memory-regularized incremental learning is performed to train the classifier dynamically on the examples of few-shot classes in each incremental session by simultaneously optimizing feature classification and co-memory regularization.

Existing methods typically fall into two paradigms: step-wise planning, which is reactive but often short-sighted; and one-shot planning, which generates a complete plan upfront yet is brittle to execution errors. Crucially, both paradigms suffer from entangled contexts, where the agent must reason over a monolithic history spanning multiple sub-tasks. This entanglement increases cognitive load and lets local errors propagate across otherwise independent decisions, making recovery computationally expensive. To address this, we propose Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP), a training-free framework that replaces entangled reasoning with task decoupling. TDP decomposes tasks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of sub-goals via a Supervisor. Using a Planner and Executor with scoped contexts, TDP confines reasoning and replanning to the active sub-task. This isolation prevents error propagation and corrects deviations locally without disrupting the workflow. Results on TravelPlanner, ScienceWorld, and HotpotQA show that TDP outperforms strong baselines while reducing token consumption by up to 82%, demonstrating that sub-task decoupling improves both robustness and efficiency for long-horizon agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "TDP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea0\u7f20\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u9010\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff09\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ea0\u7f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u9ad8\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u6613\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "TDP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7Supervisor\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff08DAG\uff09\u7684\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Planner\u548cExecutor\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u3001ScienceWorld\u548cHotpotQA\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTDP\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe82%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "Task-Decoupled Planning (TDP)\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

Philip Chen", "Tong Zhang"], "title": "Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network for Reliable Multimodal Classification", "comment": "14 pages,9 figures, 8 tables", "summary": "Reliable learning on low-quality multimodal data is a widely concerning issue, especially in safety-critical applications. However, multimodal noise poses a major challenge in this domain and leads existing methods to suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to reliably remove heterogeneous data noise, hindering robust multimodal representation learning. Second, they exhibit limited adaptability and generalization when encountering previously unseen noise. To address these issues, we propose Test-time Adaptive Hierarchical Co-enhanced Denoising Network (TAHCD). On one hand, TAHCD introduces the Adaptive Stable Subspace Alignment and Sample-Adaptive Confidence Alignment to reliably remove heterogeneous noise. They account for noise at both global and instance levels and enable jointly removal of modality-specific and cross-modality noise, achieving robust learning. On the other hand, TAHCD introduces test-time cooperative enhancement, which adaptively updates the model in response to input noise in a label-free manner, improving adaptability and generalization. This is achieved by collaboratively enhancing the joint removal process of modality-specific and cross-modality noise across global and instance levels according to sample noise.

Finally, most systems output unranked weakness lists, rather than prioritizing the most consequential issues for users. In this work, we propose DIAGPaper, a novel multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges through three tightly integrated modules. The customizer module simulates human-defined review criteria and instantiates multiple reviewer agents with criterion-specific expertise. The rebuttal module introduces author agents that engage in structured debate with reviewer agents to validate and refine proposed weaknesses. The prioritizer module learns from large-scale human review practices to assess the severity of validated weaknesses and surfaces the top-K severest ones to users.

To address this, we propose DIVER (Dynamic Iterative Visual Evidence Reasoning), a framework grounded in a progressive, evidence-driven reasoning paradigm. DIVER first establishes a strong text-based baseline through language analysis, leveraging intra-modal consistency to filter unreliable or hallucinated claims. Only when textual evidence is insufficient does the framework introduce visual information, where inter-modal alignment verification adaptively determines whether deeper visual inspection is necessary. For samples exhibiting significant cross-modal semantic discrepancies, DIVER selectively invokes fine-grained visual tools (e.g., OCR and dense captioning) to extract task-relevant evidence, which is iteratively aggregated via uncertainty-aware fusion to refine multimodal reasoning.

Our framework includes four key components: A recorder that captures screen video along with precise user interactions like mouse clicks, keystrokes, and scrolls. A learner that semantically interprets these raw interactions and the surrounding visual context, translating them into descriptive natural language captions.

Existing LLM-based agents rely on static, pre-defined tool libraries, a paradigm that fundamentally fails in scientific domains where tools are sparse, heterogeneous, and intrinsically incomplete. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Tool Evolution (TTE), a new paradigm that enables agents to synthesize, verify, and evolve executable tools during inference. By transforming tools from fixed resources into problem-driven artifacts, TTE overcomes the rigidity and long-tail limitations of static tool libraries. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciEvo, a benchmark comprising 1,590 scientific reasoning tasks supported by 925 automatically evolved tools. Extensive experiments show that TTE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and tool efficiency, while enabling effective cross-domain adaptation of computational tools.

Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation.

By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure. To boost relational reasoning, SceneNAT employs a dedicated triplet predictor for modeling the scene's layout and object relationships by mapping a set of learnable relation queries to a sparse set of symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object).

In contrast, scene graph-based image editing addresses this limitation by providing a structured representation of semantic entities and their relations, thereby offering improved controllability. However, existing scene graph editing methods typically depend on model fine-tuning, which incurs high computational cost and limits scalability. To this end, we introduce VENUS (Visual Editing with Noise inversion Using Scene graphs), a training-free framework for scene graph-guided image editing. Specifically, VENUS employs a split prompt conditioning strategy that disentangles the target object of the edit from its background context, while simultaneously leveraging noise inversion to preserve fidelity in unedited regions. Moreover, our proposed approach integrates scene graphs extracted from multimodal large language models with diffusion backbones, without requiring any additional training. Empirically, VENUS substantially improves both background preservation and semantic alignment on PIE-Bench, increasing PSNR from 22.45 to 24.80, SSIM from 0.79 to 0.84, and reducing LPIPS from 0.100 to 0.070 relative to the state-of-the-art scene graph editing model (SGEdit). In addition, VENUS enhances semantic consistency as measured by CLIP similarity (24.97 vs. 24.19). On EditVal, VENUS achieves the highest fidelity with a 0.87 DINO score and, crucially, reduces per-image runtime from 6-10 minutes to only 20-30 seconds. Beyond scene graph-based editing, VENUS also surpasses strong text-based editing baselines such as LEDIT++ and P2P+DirInv, thereby demonstrating consistent improvements across both paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "VENUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u5206\u62c6\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6216\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "VENUS\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u62c6\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u6f14\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "VENUS\u5728PIE-Bench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PSNR\u3001SSIM\u548cCLIP\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LPIPS\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff1b\u5728EditVal\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "VENUS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance.

Adversarial purification offers a promising solution by removing adversarial noise from contaminated data. However, existing purification methods are primarily designed for classification tasks and fail to address SD-specific adversarial strategies, such as attacks targeting the VAE encoder, UNet denoiser, or both. To address the gap in SD security, we propose Universal Diffusion Adversarial Purification (UDAP), a novel framework tailored for defending adversarial attacks targeting SD models. UDAP leverages the distinct reconstruction behaviors of clean and adversarial images during Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion to optimize the purification process. By minimizing the DDIM metric loss, UDAP can effectively remove adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic epoch adjustment strategy that adapts optimization iterations based on reconstruction errors, significantly improving efficiency without sacrificing purification quality. Experiments demonstrate UDAP's robustness against diverse adversarial methods, including PID (VAE-targeted), Anti-DreamBooth (UNet-targeted), MIST (hybrid), and robustness-enhanced variants like Anti-Diffusion (Anti-DF) and MetaCloak.

Recently, Google AlphaEarth (AE) embeddings, derived from multi-source geospatial observations, have emerged as a unified representation of Earth surface conditions. This study evaluated the potential of AE embeddings as alternative predictors for LSM. Two AE representations, including retained principal components and the full set of 64 embedding bands, were systematically compared with conventional LCFs across three study areas (Nantou County, Taiwan; Hong Kong; and part of Emilia-Romagna, Italy) using three deep learning models (CNN1D, CNN2D, and Vision Transformer). Performance was assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, ROC-AUC analysis, error statistics, and spatial pattern assessment. Results showed that AE-based models consistently outperformed LCFs across all regions and models, yielding higher F1-scores, AUC values, and more stable error distributions. Such improvement was most pronounced when using the full 64-band AE representation, with F1-score improvements of approximately 4% to 15% and AUC increased ranging from 0.04 to 0.11, depending on the study area and model. AE-based susceptibility maps also exhibited clearer spatial correspondence with observed landslide occurrences and enhanced sensitivity to localised landslide-prone conditions. Performance improvements were more evident in Nantou and Emilia than in Hong Kong, revealing that closer temporal alignment between AE embeddings and landslide inventories may lead to more effective LSM outcomes.

When source and target characters have vastly different bone arrangements, maintaining the original motion's semantics and quality becomes increasingly difficult. We present PALUM, a novel approach that learns common motion representations across diverse skeleton topologies by partitioning joints into semantic body parts and applying attention mechanisms to capture spatio-temporal relationships. Our method transfers motion to target skeletons by leveraging these skeleton-agnostic representations alongside target-specific structural information.

This requires diffusion models to reconcile high-frequency visual constraints and low-frequency textual guidance during the denoising process. However, while existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency, how to effectively couple this dual guidance to ensure strong adherence to the text prompt remains underexplored. In this work, we observe that in Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based I2V models, certain intermediate layers exhibit weak semantic responses (termed Semantic-Weak Layers), as indicated by a measurable drop in text-visual similarity. We attribute this to a phenomenon called Condition Isolation, where attention to visual features becomes partially detached from text guidance and overly relies on learned visual priors. To address this, we propose Focal Guidance (FG), which enhances the controllability from Semantic-Weak Layers. FG comprises two mechanisms: (1) Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) leverages CLIP to identify key regions in the reference frame and uses them as anchors to guide Semantic-Weak Layers. (2) Attention Cache transfers attention maps from semantically responsive layers to Semantic-Weak Layers, injecting explicit semantic signals and alleviating their over-reliance on the model's learned visual priors, thereby enhancing adherence to textual instructions. To further validate our approach and address the lack of evaluation in this direction, we introduce a benchmark for assessing instruction following in I2V models. On this benchmark, Focal Guidance proves its effectiveness and generalizability, raising the total score on Wan2.1-I2V to 0.7250 (+3.97\\%) and boosting the MMDiT-based HunyuanVideo-I2V to 0.5571 (+7.44\\%).", "AI": {"tldr": "FG enhances text-visual coupling in I2V models by addressing Semantic-Weak Layers, improving adherence to text prompts with measurable performance gains.", "motivation": "Existing I2V models prioritize visual consistency but lack effective coupling of visual and textual guidance, leading to weak semantic responses in certain layers (Semantic-Weak Layers).", "method": "FG comprises Fine-grained Semantic Guidance (FSG) and Attention Cache mechanisms to guide Semantic-Weak Layers by leveraging CLIP and transferring attention maps.", "result": "FG improves performance on Wan2.1-I2V (0.7250, +3.97%) and HunyuanVideo-I2V (0.5571, +7.44%), demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.", "conclusion": "Focal Guidance (FG) effectively addresses the Condition Isolation issue in DiT-based I2V models, enhancing text-visual coupling and improving adherence to textual instructions, as validated by significant performance improvements on benchmarks."}}

We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.

Current research on their fusion strategies primarily bifurcates into sequential and parallel paradigms, yet the selection process remains largely empirical, lacking systematic analysis and unified principles. We systematically compare channel-spatial attention combinations under a unified framework, building an evaluation suite of 18 topologies across four classes: sequential, parallel, multi-scale, and residual. Across two vision and nine medical datasets, we uncover a \"data scale-method-performance\" coupling law: (1) in few-shot tasks, the \"Channel-Multi-scale Spatial\" cascaded structure achieves optimal performance; (2) in medium-scale tasks, parallel learnable fusion architectures demonstrate superior results; (3) in large-scale tasks, parallel structures with dynamic gating yield the best performance. Additionally, experiments indicate that the \"Spatial-Channel\" order is more stable and effective for fine-grained classification, while residual connections mitigate vanishing gradient problems across varying data scales. We thus propose scenario-based guidelines for building future attention modules.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PulseMind, a new family of multi-modal diagnostic models that integrates a systematically curated dataset, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, and a tailored training framework. Specifically, we first construct a diagnostic dataset, MediScope, which comprises 98,000 real-world multi-turn consultations and 601,500 medical images, spanning over 10 major clinical departments and more than 200 sub-specialties. Then, to better reflect the requirements of real-world clinical diagnosis, we develop the PulseMind Benchmark, a multi-turn diagnostic consultation benchmark with a four-dimensional evaluation protocol comprising proactiveness, accuracy, usefulness, and language quality. Finally, we design a training framework tailored for multi-modal clinical diagnostics, centered around a core component named Comparison-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (CRPO).

This results in a disconnect between what the model internally understands and what it ultimately expresses, a phenomenon we describe as seeing it right but saying it wrong. To address this issue, we propose DualPD, a dual-perspective decoding refinement strategy that enhances the visual understanding without any additional training. DualPD consists of two components. (1) The layer-wise attention-guided contrastive logits module captures how the belief in the correct answer evolves by comparing output logits between layers that exhibit the largest attention shift. (2) The head-wise information filtering module suppresses low-contribution attention heads that focus on irrelevant regions, thereby improving attention quality within each layer. Experiments conducted on both the LLaVA and Qwen-VL model families across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that DualPD consistently improves accuracy without training, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conventional mean teacher (MT) methods typically employ a static approach, where the roles of the teacher and student models are fixed. However, due to the complexity of 3D vessel data, the teacher model may not always outperform the student model, leading to cognitive biases that can limit performance. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic collaborative network that allows the two models to dynamically switch their teacher-student roles. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view integration module to capture various perspectives of the inputs, mirroring the way doctors conduct medical analysis. We also incorporate adversarial supervision to constrain the shape of the segmented vessels in unlabeled data. In this process, the 3D volume is projected into 2D views to mitigate the impact of label inconsistencies.

Traditional deep learning models often suffer from overfitting and high computational costs. Self-distillation (SD), a variant of knowledge distillation where a network learns from its own predictions, has recently emerged as a promising strategy to enhance model performance without requiring external teacher networks. In this work, we explore the application of SD to HSI by treating earlier outputs as soft targets, thereby enforcing consistency between intermediate and final predictions.

Due to heavy compute requirements, most large visual language models (VLMs) for VideoQA rely on a fixed number of frames by uniformly sampling the video. However, this process does not pick important frames or capture the context of the video. We present a novel query-based selection of frames relevant to the questions based on the submodular mutual Information (SMI) functions. By replacing uniform frame sampling with query-based selection, our method ensures that the chosen frames provide complementary and essential visual information for accurate VideoQA. We evaluate our approach on the MVBench dataset, which spans a diverse set of multi-action video tasks. VideoQA accuracy on this dataset was assessed using two VLMs, namely Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, both of which originally employed uniform frame sampling. Experiments were conducted using both uniform and query-based sampling strategies. An accuracy improvement of up to \\textbf{4\\%} was observed when using query-based frame selection over uniform sampling. Qualitative analysis further highlights that query-based selection, using SMI functions, consistently picks frames better aligned with the question.

Recently, dynamic resolution sampling has emerged as a promising acceleration technique by reducing the resolution of early sampling steps. However, existing methods rely on heuristic re-noising at every resolution transition, injecting noise that breaks cross-stage consistency and forces the model to relearn global structure. In addition, these methods indiscriminately upsample the entire latent space at once without checking which regions have actually converged, causing accumulated errors, and visible artifacts. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{Fresco}, a dynamic resolution framework that unifies re-noise and global structure across stages with progressive upsampling, preserving both the efficiency of low-resolution drafting and the fidelity of high-resolution refinement, with all stages aligned toward the same final target. Fresco achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 10$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, and 5$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo, while remaining orthogonal to distillation, quantization and feature caching, reaching 22$\\times$ speedup when combined with distilled models.

Most existing methods rely on uniform supervision, implicitly assuming a constant difficulty distribution across layout regions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by revealing a critical flaw: \\textbf{Positional Disparity}, a phenomenon where models demonstrate mastery over the deterministic start and end regions but suffer a performance collapse in the complex intermediate sections. This degradation arises because standard training allows the massive volume of easy patterns to drown out the learning signals from difficult layouts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FocalOrder}, a framework driven by \\textbf{Focal Preference Optimization (FPO)}.

However, achieving high-fidelity segmentation remains challenging due to adhesion artifacts in naturally occluded scans, which are caused by low contrast and indistinct inter-arch boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose the Anatomy Aware Cascade Network (AACNet), a coarse-to-fine framework designed to resolve boundary ambiguity while maintaining global structural consistency. Specifically, we introduce two mechanisms: the Ambiguity Gated Boundary Refiner (AGBR) and the Signed Distance Map guided Anatomical Attention (SDMAA). The AGBR employs an entropy based gating mechanism to perform targeted feature rectification in high uncertainty transition zones. Meanwhile, the SDMAA integrates implicit geometric constraints via signed distance map to enforce topological consistency, preventing the loss of spatial details associated with standard pooling. Experimental results on a dataset of 125 CBCT volumes demonstrate that AACNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 90.17 \\% and a 95\\% Hausdorff Distance of 3.63 mm, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization on an external dataset with an HD95 of 2.19 mm, validating its reliability for downstream clinical applications such as surgical planning.

However, existing systems rely on hardware-intensive multi-camera setups and demand high bandwidth for volumetric streaming, limiting their real-time performance on mobile devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mon3tr, a novel Monocular 3D telepresence framework that integrates 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) based parametric human modeling into telepresence for the first time. Mon3tr adopts an amortized computation strategy, dividing the process into a one-time offline multi-view reconstruction phase to build a user-specific avatar and a monocular online inference phase during live telepresence sessions. A single monocular RGB camera is used to capture body motions and facial expressions in real time to drive the 3DGS-based parametric human model, significantly reducing system complexity and cost. The extracted motion and appearance features are transmitted at < 0.2 Mbps over WebRTC's data channel, allowing robust adaptation to network fluctuations. On the receiver side, e.g., Meta Quest 3, we develop a lightweight 3DGS attribute deformation network to dynamically generate corrective 3DGS attribute adjustments on the pre-built avatar, synthesizing photorealistic motion and appearance at ~ 60 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, achieving a PSNR of > 28 dB for novel poses, an end-to-end latency of ~ 80 ms, and > 1000x bandwidth reduction compared to point-cloud streaming, while supporting real-time operation from monocular inputs across diverse scenarios.

However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark. BenchSeg aggregates 55 dish scenes (from Nutrition5k, Vegetables & Fruits, MetaFood3D, and FoodKit) with 25,284 meticulously annotated frames, capturing each dish under free 360\u00b0 camera motion. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames.

Excluding the most uncertain 20 percent of cases improved AUC to 0.91 and balanced accuracy to 0.86. Decision curve analysis showed clinical benefit for threshold probabilities between 0.30 and 0.40.

Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset.

Popular methods often rely on high-quality Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to merge visual features with extracted text. This dependency introduces two major drawbacks: propagation of text recognition errors and substantial computational overhead, limiting the robustness and practical applicability of multimodal approaches. In contrast to the prevailing multimodal trend, we argue that effective layout analysis depends not on text-visual fusion, but on a deep understanding of documents' intrinsic visual structure. To this end, we propose PARL (Position-Aware Relation Learning Network), a novel OCR-free, vision-only framework that models layout through positional sensitivity and relational structure. Specifically, we first introduce a Bidirectional Spatial Position-Guided Deformable Attention module to embed explicit positional dependencies among layout elements directly into visual features.

However, existing pipelines typically decouple motion quantization from semantic embedding learning, linking them solely via token IDs. This approach fails to effectively align the intrinsic geometry of the motion space with the embedding space, thereby hindering the LLM's capacity for nuanced motion reasoning. We argue that alignment is most effective when both modalities share a unified geometric basis. Therefore, instead of forcing the LLM to reconstruct the complex geometry among motion tokens from scratch, we present a novel framework that explicitly enforces orthogonality on both the motion codebook and the LLM embedding space, ensuring that their relational structures naturally mirror each other. Specifically, we employ a decoder-only quantizer with Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable training and balanced codebook usage. To bridge the modalities, we use a sparse projection that maps motion codes into the LLM embedding space while preserving orthogonality. Finally, a two-stage orthonormal regularization schedule enforces soft constraints during tokenizer training and LLM fine-tuning to maintain geometric alignment without hindering semantic adaptation. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D demonstrate that our framework achieves a 20% performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, validating that a unified geometric basis effectively empowers the LLM for nuanced motion reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724cID\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u7ed3\u5408Gumbel-Softmax\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u7ef4\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing 3D generative methods often produce monolithic meshes that lack the structural flexibility required by industrial pipelines in gaming and animation.

To achieve production-level fidelity, we introduce a novel semantic surface extraction formalism compatible with hybrid implicit fields. This mechanism is accelerated by a coarse-to-fine proposal scheme, which significantly reduces memory footprint and enables high-resolution mesh generation. Furthermore, we propose a video-diffusion-based texture decomposition module that disentangles appearance into editable layers (e.g., separated iris and skin), resolving semantic confusion in facial regions. Experiments demonstrate that StdGEN++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in geometric accuracy and semantic disentanglement.

While recent studies use synthetic images to improve License Plate Recognition (LPR) results, there remain several limitations in these efforts. This work addresses these constraints by comprehensively exploring the integration of real and synthetic data to enhance LPR performance. We subject 16 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models to a benchmarking process involving 12 public datasets acquired from various regions. Several key findings emerge from our investigation. Primarily, the massive incorporation of synthetic data substantially boosts model performance in both intra- and cross-dataset scenarios. We examine three distinct methodologies for generating synthetic data: template-based generation, character permutation, and utilizing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, each contributing significantly to performance enhancement. The combined use of these methodologies demonstrates a notable synergistic effect, leading to end-to-end results that surpass those reached by state-of-the-art methods and established commercial systems. Our experiments also underscore the efficacy of synthetic data in mitigating challenges posed by limited training data, enabling remarkable results to be achieved even with small fractions of the original training data.

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes \"near-miss\" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks.

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning.

To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art.

However, this requires the use of pretrained external networks, introducing additional dependencies and reducing flexibility. In this work, we argue that DiTs actually have the power to guide the training of themselves, and propose \\textbf{Self-Transcendence}, a simple yet effective method that achieves fast convergence using internal feature supervision only. It is found that the slow convergence in DiT training primarily stems from the difficulty of representation learning in shallow layers. To address this, we initially train the DiT model by aligning its shallow features with the latent representations from the pretrained VAE for a short phase (e.g., 40 epochs), then apply classifier-free guidance to the intermediate features, enhancing their discriminative capability and semantic expressiveness. These enriched internal features, learned entirely within the model, are used as supervision signals to guide a new DiT training. Compared to existing self-contained methods, our approach brings a significant performance boost. It can even surpass REPA in terms of generation quality and convergence speed, but without the need for any external pretrained models.

This task is usually addressed with automated crater detection algorithms (CDA) based on deep learning techniques. It is non-trivial due to the vast amount of craters of various sizes and shapes, as well as challenging conditions such as varying illumination and rugged terrain. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning CDA based on the OWLv2 model, which is built on a Vision Transformer, that has proven highly effective in various computer vision tasks. For fine-tuning, we utilize a manually labeled dataset fom the IMPACT project, that provides crater annotations on high-resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Calibrated Data Record images.

Prevailing paradigms typically utilize Siamese encoders bridged by explicit difference computation modules, such as subtraction or concatenation, to identify changes. In this work, we challenge this complexity with SEED (Siamese Encoder-Exchange-Decoder), a streamlined paradigm that replaces explicit differencing with parameter-free feature exchange. By sharing weights across both Siamese encoders and decoders, SEED effectively operates as a single parameter set model. Theoretically, we formalize feature exchange as an orthogonal permutation operator and prove that, under pixel consistency, this mechanism preserves mutual information and Bayes optimal risk, whereas common arithmetic fusion methods often introduce information loss. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, including SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, PX-CLCD, WaterCD, and CDD, and three backbones, namely SwinT, EfficientNet, and ResNet, demonstrate that SEED matches or surpasses state of the art methods despite its simplicity. Furthermore, we reveal that standard semantic segmentation models can be transformed into competitive change detectors solely by inserting this exchange mechanism, referred to as SEG2CD. The proposed paradigm offers a robust, unified, and interpretable framework for change detection, demonstrating that simple feature exchange is sufficient for high performance information fusion.

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.
