Abstract: Rapid motorization in emerging economies such as India has created severe enforcement asymmetries, with over 11 million recorded violations in 2023 against a human policing density of roughly one officer per 4000 vehicles. Traditional surveillance and manual ticketing cannot scale to this magnitude, motivating the need for an autonomous, cooperative, and energy efficient edge AI perception infrastructure. This paper presents a real time roadside perception node for multi class traffic violation analytics and safety event dissemination within a connected and intelligent vehicle ecosystem. The node integrates YOLOv8 Nano for high accuracy multi object detection, DeepSORT for temporally consistent vehicle tracking, and a rule guided OCR post processing engine capable of recognizing degraded or multilingual license plates compliant with MoRTH AIS 159 and ISO 7591 visual contrast standards. Deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a 128 core Maxwell GPU and optimized via TensorRT FP16 quantization, the system sustains 28 to 30 frames per second inference at 9.6 W, achieving 97.7 percent violation detection accuracy and 84.9 percent OCR precision across five violation classes, namely signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U turn, and speeding, without manual region of interest calibration. Comparative benchmarking against YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus demonstrates a 10.7 percent mean average precision gain and a 1.4 times accuracy per watt improvement. Beyond enforcement, the node publishes standardized safety events of CAM and DENM type to connected vehicles and intelligent transportation system backends via V2X protocols, demonstrating that roadside edge AI analytics can augment cooperative perception and proactive road safety management within the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles ecosystem.

*Anh H. Vo,Tae-Seok Kim,Hulin Jin,Soo-Mi Choi,Yong-Guk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种指令驱动的面部表情生成框架，通过IFED和I2FET方法实现文本到面部表情的转换，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了模拟真实的情感变化，需要能够在任意两个面部表情之间生成平滑的过渡。

Method: 提出了Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED)模块和Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET)方法，结合顶点重建损失函数优化潜在向量的语义理解。

Result: 在CK+和CelebV-HQ数据集上表现优于现有方法，能够根据文本指令生成面部表情序列。

Conclusion: 该框架能够根据文本指令生成面部表情轨迹，并有望在实际应用中发挥作用。

Abstract: A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/

Conclusion: 现有方法在真实场景下的数据偏移中存在局限性，研究为未来稳健的3D感知研究建立了强基线。

Abstract: For 3D perception systems to be practical in real-world applications -- from autonomous driving to embodied AI -- models must adapt to continuously evolving object definitions and sensor domains. Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.

### [4] [Geo-NVS-w: Geometry-Aware Novel View Synthesis In-the-Wild with an SDF Renderer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08371)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-NVS-w通过SDF和几何保留损失，在非结构化图像中实现高效、几何一致的新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂表面上缺乏几何基础，可能导致结果不一致，Geo-NVS-w旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用基于Signed Distance Function (SDF)的几何表示来指导渲染过程，并引入Geometry-Preservation Loss以保留精细结构细节。

Result: Geo-NVS-w在渲染性能上具有竞争力，能耗比类似方法降低4-5倍，并生成具有几何一致性的逼真结果。

Conclusion: Geo-NVS-w是一个鲁棒的方法，能够在非结构化图像集合中实现高保真的新视角合成，同时保持几何一致性并显著降低能耗。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-NVS-w, a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections. While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.

Conclusion: 本文提出的事件分割方法和预测置信度估计显著提升了零样本ADL识别的性能，优于现有时间分割方法和监督学习方法。

Abstract: Unobtrusive sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart homes by processing data collected from IoT sensing devices supports applications such as healthcare, safety, and energy management. Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.

Conclusion: 本文提出的局部基于补丁的重定向方法成功地将源面部表情的语义意义传递给了面部特征比例差异较大的风格化角色。

Abstract: In the era of digital animation, the quest to produce lifelike facial animations for virtual characters has led to the development of various retargeting methods. While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.

Abstract: Maize disease classification plays a vital role in mitigating yield losses and ensuring food security. However, the deployment of traditional disease detection models in resource-constrained environments, such as those using smartphones and drones, faces challenges due to high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose LWMSCNN-SE, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates multi-scale feature extraction, depthwise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanisms. This novel combination enables the model to achieve 96.63% classification accuracy with only 241,348 parameters and 0.666 GFLOPs, making it suitable for real-time deployment in field applications. Our approach addresses the accuracy--efficiency trade-off by delivering high accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, demonstrating its potential for efficient maize disease diagnosis on edge devices in precision farming systems.

Abstract: The transformative potential of 3D content creation has been progressively unlocked through advancements in generative models. Recently, intuitive drag editing with geometric changes has attracted significant attention in 2D editing yet remains challenging for 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce 3DGS-Drag -- a point-based 3D editing framework that provides efficient, intuitive drag manipulation of real 3D scenes. Our approach bridges the gap between deformation-based and 2D-editing-based 3D editing methods, addressing their limitations to geometry-related content editing. We leverage two key innovations: deformation guidance utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for consistent geometric modifications and diffusion guidance for content correction and visual quality enhancement. A progressive editing strategy further supports aggressive 3D drag edits. Our method enables a wide range of edits, including motion change, shape adjustment, inpainting, and content extension. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DGS-Drag in various scenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance in geometry-related 3D content editing. Notably, the editing is efficient, taking 10 to 20 minutes on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

Abstract: This paper presents the Sesame Plant Segmentation Dataset, an open source annotated image dataset designed to support the development of artificial intelligence models for agricultural applications, with a specific focus on sesame plants. The dataset comprises 206 training images, 43 validation images, and 43 test images in YOLO compatible segmentation format, capturing sesame plants at early growth stages under varying environmental conditions. Data were collected using a high resolution mobile camera from farms in Jirdede, Daura Local Government Area, Katsina State, Nigeria, and annotated using the Segment Anything Model version 2 with farmer supervision. Unlike conventional bounding box datasets, this dataset employs pixel level segmentation to enable more precise detection and analysis of sesame plants in real world farm settings. Model evaluation using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework demonstrated strong performance for both detection and segmentation tasks. For bounding box detection, the model achieved a recall of 79 percent, precision of 79 percent, mean average precision at IoU 0.50 of 84 percent, and mean average precision from 0.50 to 0.95 of 58 percent. For segmentation, it achieved a recall of 82 percent, precision of 77 percent, mean average precision at IoU 0.50 of 84 percent, and mean average precision from 0.50 to 0.95 of 52 percent. The dataset represents a novel contribution to sesame focused agricultural vision datasets in Nigeria and supports applications such as plant monitoring, yield estimation, and agricultural research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机影像中点级玉米定位的挑战，包括极小的物体像素比、超高分辨率图像的计算成本高以及农业场景特有的复杂性。

Method: 提出Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT)，用Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN)模块替代传统多层感知机，并引入PKAN Additive Attention (PAA)以降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 整合Kolmogorov-Arnold表示理论与高效注意力机制为高分辨率农业遥感提供了有效框架。

Abstract: High-resolution UAV photogrammetry has become a key technology for precision agriculture, enabling centimeter-level crop monitoring and point-level plant localization. However, point-level maize localization in UAV imagery remains challenging due to (1) extremely small object-to-pixel ratios, typically less than 0.1%, (2) prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images larger than 3000 x 4000 pixels, and (3) agricultural scene-specific complexities such as sparse object distribution and environmental variability that are poorly handled by general-purpose vision models.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT), which replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we present the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset, consisting of 1,928 high-resolution UAV images with approximately 501,000 point annotations collected under real field conditions.
  Extensive experiments show that AKT achieves an average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%. For downstream tasks, AKT attains a mean absolute error of 7.1 in stand counting and a root mean square error of 1.95-1.97 cm in interplant spacing estimation. These results demonstrate that integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theory with efficient attention mechanisms offers an effective framework for high-resolution agricultural remote sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Gabor和GLCM特征在建模早期视觉搜索行为中的关系，提出了两种特征组合流程，结果显示这些特征在编码图像信息上有强相关性，且预测的注视区域与人类早期注视行为一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类视觉搜索行为是视觉科学和计算机视觉中的基本问题，对建模观察者在位置未知搜索任务中的注意力分配有直接影响。

Method: 提出了两个特征组合流程，将Gabor和GLCM特征结合以缩小人类注视的可能区域，并使用模拟数字乳腺断层合成图像进行评估。

Result: 结果显示提出的流程与基于阈值的模型观察者预测的注视候选区域在定性上一致。GLCM均值与Gabor特征响应之间存在强相关性，表明这些特征编码了相关的图像信息。眼动数据进一步表明预测的注视区域与早期注视行为一致。

Conclusion: 结合结构和纹理特征在视觉搜索建模中具有重要价值，支持开发感知信息丰富的观察者模型。

Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CASHEW和CASHEW-RL方法，显著提升视觉语言模型的多步推理稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在多步推理中表现不稳定、推理轨迹不一致的问题。

Method: CASHEW通过推理时框架聚合多个候选轨迹并进行视觉验证；CASHEW-RL则通过GSPO训练，内部化聚合行为。

Result: 在13个图像和视频理解基准测试中表现显著提升，如ScienceQA提升23.6个百分点，EgoSchema提升8.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过引入CASHEW和CASHEW-RL两种互补方法，显著提升了视觉语言模型在多步推理任务中的稳定性和性能表现。

Abstract: Vision-language models achieve strong performance across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, yet their multi-step reasoning remains unstable. Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TP-Blend是一种无需训练的框架，通过双文本提示（对象和风格）在单次去噪中实现高质量编辑，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本条件扩散编辑器在同时引入新对象和新风格时表现不佳，因此需要一种轻量级、无需训练的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: TP-Blend采用两个互补的注意力处理器：Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF)用于对象融合，通过熵正则化最优传输问题重新分配特征向量；Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF)通过Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization注入风格。

Result: TP-Blend在定量保真度、感知质量和推理速度上均优于现有基线方法，能够生成高分辨率、照片级真实的编辑结果。

Conclusion: TP-Blend通过结合两个独立的文本提示（对象和风格），在单次去噪轨迹中实现了高质量的对象替换和风格注入，超越了现有基线方法。

Abstract: Current text-conditioned diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when a new object and a new style must be introduced simultaneously. We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.

We introduce a deep learning framework that decodes latent representations into geometrically valid, printable objects while respecting manufacturing constraints such as overhang angles, wall thickness, and structural integrity. The methodology demonstrates that neural decoders can learn complex mapping functions from abstract representations to valid 3D geometries, producing parts with significantly improved manufacturability compared to naive generation approaches. We validate the approach on diverse object categories and demonstrate practical 3D printing of decoder-generated structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）微调过程中标注成本高且耗时的问题，以及现有多样性选择方法计算量大、缺乏可扩展性的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种结合概念多样性（CBD）和简单不确定性度量（Margin）的混合输入选择方法。

Result: CBD与几何多样性（GD）强相关且计算时间大幅减少；基于CBD的选择方法在多种DNN模型、输入集和选择预算下均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于概念多样性（CBD）的选择方法不仅有效且计算效率高，尤其在重复和大规模输入选择场景中展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Maintaining or improving the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through fine-tuning requires labeling newly collected inputs, a process that is often costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet. These results confirm not only the effectiveness and computational advantage of the CBD-based approach, particularly compared to hybrid baselines, but also its scalability in repetitive and extensive input selection scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有观点，即图像与文本对齐仅出现在深层网络层，证明从第一层开始即存在有意义的概念对齐。

Method: 采用了一种基于DeepDream启发的合成方法，通过优化生成与文本概念向量对齐的图像。

Result: 在Gemma 3模型的七个层中，超过50%的合成图像在第一层即能识别出目标文本概念的显著视觉特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型的可解释性提供了新路径，通过可视化模型的表示空间来追踪其图像处理组件。

Abstract: We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法多依赖多模态（如语言）生成细粒度提示，视觉方法仅能实现图像级分类，缺乏空间精度。

Method: 利用预训练的DDIM模型，通过反演输入图像获取潜在表示，并从固定中间时间步开始去噪重建图像，生成正常外观的重建。

Result: 在VISA数据集上达到最先进性能，无需辅助模态即可实现强定位能力。

Conclusion: 该方法摆脱了零样本异常检测对提示的依赖，为研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-Shot image Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to detect and localise anomalies without access to any normal training samples of the target data. While recent ZSAD approaches leverage additional modalities such as language to generate fine-grained prompts for localisation, vision-only methods remain limited to image-level classification, lacking spatial precision. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., "an image of an [object class]"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset, demonstrating strong localisation capabilities without auxiliary modalities and facilitating a shift away from prompt dependence for zero-shot anomaly detection research.

Conclusion: FigEx2框架通过视觉条件化设计、噪声感知门控融合模块和分阶段优化策略，显著提升了科学复合图中面板的定位和描述生成能力，并在跨学科领域展示了出色的零样本迁移性。

Abstract: Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scientific image manipulation in biomedical publications poses a growing threat to research integrity and reproducibility. Unlike natural image forensics, biomedical forgery detection is uniquely challenging due to domain-specific artifacts, complex textures, and unstructured figure layouts. We present the first vision-language guided framework for both generating and detecting biomedical image forgeries. By combining diffusion-based synthesis with vision-language prompting, our method enables realistic and semantically controlled manipulations, including duplication, splicing, and region removal, across diverse biomedical modalities. We introduce Rescind, a large-scale benchmark featuring fine-grained annotations and modality-specific splits, and propose Integscan, a structured state space modeling framework that integrates attention-enhanced visual encoding with prompt-conditioned semantic alignment for precise forgery localization. To ensure semantic fidelity, we incorporate a vision-language model based verification loop that filters generated forgeries based on consistency with intended prompts. Extensive experiments on Rescind and existing benchmarks demonstrate that Integscan achieves state of the art performance in both detection and localization, establishing a strong foundation for automated scientific integrity analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究故意在训练数据中引入受控噪声对提高模型鲁棒性的影响，以应对现实世界中常见的噪声和失真问题。

Method: 使用CIFAR-10数据集，评估了三种常见噪声（高斯噪声、椒盐噪声和高斯模糊）在不同强度和训练集污染水平下的影响，并采用Resnet-18模型进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，训练数据中仅引入10%的噪声数据即可显著降低测试损失，并在完全噪声测试条件下提高准确性，同时对干净数据性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 战略性地在训练数据中引入噪声可以作为一种简单有效的正则化方法，提供传统数据清洁度与现实世界鲁棒性之间的实用权衡。

Abstract: Data quality plays a central role in the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.

Conclusion: DINO-AugSeg通过结合小波域增强和上下文融合模块，显著提升了少样本医学图像分割的性能，为这一领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the scarcity of annotated training data. Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation. Code and data will be made available on https://github.com/apple1986/DINO-AugSeg.

Our three-stage framework first synthesizes target objects within domain-specific backgrounds through controlled inpainting. The generated outputs are then validated via a multi-modal assessment that integrates object detection, aesthetic scoring, and vision-language alignment. Finally, a user-preference classifier is employed to capture subjective selection criteria. This pipeline enables the efficient construction of high-quality, deployable datasets while reducing reliance on extensive real-world data collection.

Abstract: The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视觉语义分割（AVSS）需要超越简单的声源对象识别，实现语义层面的场景理解。传统方法分解任务的方式存在局限，需创新策略。

Method: 提出了一种名为SSP的协作框架，整合光流和文本提示，通过预掩码技术和视觉-文本对齐模块（VTA）优化分割过程。

Result: 实验表明，SSP在音频-视觉分割任务中优于现有方法，提供了高效且精确的分割结果。

Conclusion: SSP框架通过结合光流和文本提示，显著提升了音频-视觉语义分割任务的性能，特别是在处理动态和静态声源对象时表现出色。

Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \textit{S}tepping \textit{S}tone \textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.

Conclusion: SubTTA通过对齐视觉和文本模态的语义子空间，有效提升了零样本预测的准确性，从而优化了测试时适应过程，并在多种基准测试和VLM架构上平均提高了2.24%的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.

Abstract: The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个无需训练的对比注意力框架，通过模拟早期融合层与最终层之间的注意力转换，有效提升了多模态推理性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding, yet how they internally integrate visual and textual information remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage "review" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance. Code will be released.

Conclusion: Motive（MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration）是首个专注于视频生成模型中运动而非视觉外观的数据归因框架，通过运动加权损失掩码高效计算运动特定影响，指导数据筛选，显著提升时间一致性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的实例对齐字幕框架显著提升了视频异常检测的可解释性和可验证性，为未来可信赖和可解释的异常检测研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Explainable video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for safety-critical applications, yet even with recent progress, much of the research still lacks spatial grounding, making the explanations unverifiable. This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火箭发射时极端成像条件（如高浓度颗粒雾霾和超过120 dB的亮度变化）严重影响了光学测量数据的质量。

Method: 结合定制化的空间变化曝光（SVE）传感器与物理感知的去雾算法，动态估计雾霾密度并进行区域自适应光照优化。

Result: 在真实发射图像和受控实验中验证，该框架能有效恢复羽流和发动机区域的物理准确视觉信息。

Conclusion: 该框架通过硬件-算法协同设计，成功解决了火箭发射极端环境下光学测量的挑战，为提取关键机械参数提供了可靠图像基础。

Abstract: Quantitative optical measurement of critical mechanical parameters -- such as plume flow fields, shock wave structures, and nozzle oscillations -- during rocket launch faces severe challenges due to extreme imaging conditions. Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region. This offers a reliable image basis for extracting key mechanical parameters, including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration, thereby supporting precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments.

Conclusion: SISTA框架通过多级对齐策略显著提升了医学视觉-语言预训练模型在下游任务中的性能，特别是在细粒度任务和数据有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.

Abstract: We present CogniMap3D, a bioinspired framework for dynamic 3D scene understanding and reconstruction that emulates human cognitive processes. Our approach maintains a persistent memory bank of static scenes, enabling efficient spatial knowledge storage and rapid retrieval. CogniMap3D integrates three core capabilities: a multi-stage motion cue framework for identifying dynamic objects, a cognitive mapping system for storing, recalling, and updating static scenes across multiple visits, and a factor graph optimization strategy for refining camera poses. Given an image stream, our model identifies dynamic regions through motion cues with depth and camera pose priors, then matches static elements against its memory bank. When revisiting familiar locations, CogniMap3D retrieves stored scenes, relocates cameras, and updates memory with new observations. Evaluations on video depth estimation, camera pose reconstruction, and 3D mapping tasks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, while effectively supporting continuous scene understanding across extended sequences and multiple visits.

Motivation: Zhang等人使用简单角点模型获取角点特征存在理论缺陷，因为相邻角点的灰度信息会相互影响。

Method: 使用二阶高斯方向导数（SOGDD）滤波器对两种典型的高分辨率角点模型（END型和L型）进行平滑处理，并推导了这两种角点模型的SOGDD表示，发现了高分辨率角点的许多特性。

Abstract: Corner detection is widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image matching and 3D reconstruction. Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points. The experimental results have verified that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.

Result: Gemini-3-Pro表现最佳，诊断推理上优于实习生（Macro-F1 0.641 vs. 0.492），与初级内窥镜医师相当（0.727；p>0.05），但在空间定位上显著落后（mIoU 0.345 vs. >0.506；p<0.05）。模型生成报告的语言流畅性优于人类，但事实准确性较低。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

TL;DR: GPM模拟人类视觉系统，提出全局到并行的多尺度编码方法，构建的H-GPE网络在多项任务中实现高效性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级模型在减少计算量的同时往往增加参数量（如LSNet、MobileMamba），难以在资源受限设备上部署。此外，现有基于人类视觉感知的模型过于简化，无法真实反映感知过程。

Method: GPM首先通过全局洞察生成器（GIG）提取整体线索，随后通过并行分支处理不同尺度的特征：LSAE关注中/大尺度语义关系，IRB保留细粒度纹理信息，实现全局与局部特征的连贯表示。

Result: H-GPE网络在图像分类、目标检测和语义分割任务中实现了强性能，同时在FLOPs和参数量上保持平衡，优于当前最先进的轻量级模型。

Conclusion: GPM（Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding）通过模拟人类视觉系统的协作机制，提出了一种全局到并行的多尺度编码方法，显著提升了轻量级视觉网络的性能与效率平衡。基于GPM构建的H-GPE网络在图像分类、目标检测和语义分割任务中表现出色，同时保持了较低的计算和参数量。

Abstract: Lightweight vision networks have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet achieving a satisfactory balance among parameter scale, computational overhead, and task performance remains difficult. Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.

Motivation: 现有医疗图像分析系统多为单次黑箱，缺乏对推理、安全性和空间基础的控制，R^4旨在解决这些问题。

Method: R^4框架分解医疗成像工作流程为四个协调代理：Router配置任务和专业化感知提示；Retriever生成自由文本报告和边界框；Reflector批判草案-框对；Repairer迭代修订叙述和空间输出。

Result: 在胸部X光分析中，R^4显著提升了LLM-as-a-Judge分数约+1.7-+2.5分和mAP50约+2.5-+3.5分，无需基于梯度的微调。

Conclusion: R^4框架通过代理路由、反思和修复，将强大但脆弱的视觉语言模型（VLMs）转变为更可靠、更基础的工具，用于临床图像解释。

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on large vision-language models (VLMs), yet most systems remain single-pass black boxes that offer limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. These results show that agentic routing, reflection, and repair can turn strong but brittle VLMs into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.

Motivation: 多站点脑MRI数据聚合虽能增强深度学习模型训练，但站点特异性差异（如扫描仪厂商、采集参数等）会引入非生物异质性，影响模型泛化能力。现有方法依赖有限配对数据或无法有效解耦风格与解剖结构，且多限于单序列协调。

Method: MMH采用两阶段方法：1）基于扩散的全局协调器，通过风格无关的梯度条件将MR图像映射到序列特定统一域；2）目标特定微调器，将全局对齐图像适配到目标域。利用BiomedCLIP编码器通过多视角嵌入表征体积风格信息，实现风格与解剖结构的显式解耦。

Conclusion: MMH框架在多站点多序列脑MRI数据协调中表现出色，显著提升了图像特征聚类、体素级比较、组织分割及下游任务（如年龄和站点分类）的性能。

Abstract: Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in smart homes is critical for health monitoring and assistive living. While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD). Experimental results demonstrate that MobiDiary effectively generalizes across modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on captioning metrics (e.g., BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC) and outperforming specialized baselines in continuous action understanding.

Abstract: Ruminal acidosis is a prevalent metabolic disorder in dairy cattle causing significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance. Our work establishes the feasibility of gas emission-based livestock health monitoring, paving the way for practical, in vitro acidosis detection systems.

In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏标准化数据集长期以来阻碍了自动脉冲内调制分类（AIMC）的进展，特别是在噪声或退化条件下。

Method: 重新实现并评估了五种代表性的深度学习算法，包括轻量级CNN、去噪架构和基于Transformer的网络。

Result: 结果显示性能差异显著，频率调制（FM）信号在低信噪比（SNR）下比相位或混合类型更可靠地被分类。

Conclusion: AIMC-Spec提供了一个可重复的基准，并为AIMC领域的未来研究和标准化奠定了基础。

Abstract: A lack of standardized datasets has long hindered progress in automatic intrapulse modulation classification (AIMC) - a critical task in radar signal analysis for electronic support systems, particularly under noisy or degraded conditions. AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.

TL;DR: HIPPO通过改进令牌保留和并行解码，显著加速视频-LLMs推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SD方法在视频-LLMs中无法达到与纯文本LLMs相当的推理加速效果，主要因令牌修剪策略不足和剩余推理成本限制。

Method: 提出HIPPO框架，包括语义感知令牌保留方法和视频并行推测解码算法。

Result: 在四个视频-LLMs和六个基准测试中，HIPPO实现了最高3.51倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: HIPPO框架通过语义感知的令牌保留方法和视频并行推测解码算法，显著提升了视频-LLMs的推理速度，最高可达3.51倍加速。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

Conclusion: 使用胶囊架构的方法在工业应用到人脸识别基准测试中表现优异，且易于使用和优化。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in the computer vision community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. But learning good features often is computationally expensive in machine learning settings and is especially difficult when there is a lack of data. One-shot learning is one such area where only limited data is available. In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition. We use a special technique with stacked images and use siamese capsule networks. It is encouraging to see that the approach using capsule architecture achieves strong results and exceeds other techniques on a wide range of datasets from industrial application to face recognition benchmarks while being easy to use and optimise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLLMs是否具备与人类直觉相当的基本视觉原语能力。

Method: 通过KidVis基准测试，将视觉智能分解为六种原子能力（专注、追踪、辨别、记忆、空间、闭合），评估20种最先进的MLLMs。

Result: 人类儿童平均得分95.32，而最先进的GPT-5仅得67.33，且模型参数增加并未线性提升这些基础视觉能力。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）尽管在高级推理任务中表现出色，但仍缺乏人类直觉所具备的基本视觉原语能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive proficiency in high-level reasoning tasks, such as complex diagrammatic interpretation, it remains an open question whether they possess the fundamental visual primitives comparable to human intuition. To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a "Scaling Law Paradox": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba架构在光谱重建任务中面临单空间感知和单尺度特征提取的局限性，无法充分理解高光谱图像的复杂结构和细节。

Method: 设计了一个多感知融合块，并将其集成到U-Net结构中，以提取和融合全局、中间和局部特征，实现多尺度的高光谱图像重建。

Result: 大量定量和定性实验表明，M3SR在性能上优于现有最先进方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: M3SR架构通过多感知融合块和U-Net结构的结合，显著提升了高光谱图像重建的准确性和效率，同时在计算成本上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has been widely applied to various low-level vision tasks due to its exceptional adaptability and strong performance. Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning, but state-of-the-art models are often too large for clinics with limited computing resources. Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss. To address these deployment and speed constraints, we propose Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD), a training-only framework that transfers both fine-grained anatomical detail and long-range contextual information from a high-capacity teacher to a compact student network. The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.

Motivation: 尽管LMMs在低层次视觉感知任务（如IQA）中表现出色，但达到最先进性能通常需要计算成本高昂的微调方法。本文旨在开发一种无需训练的框架，以提升LMMs的IQA能力。

Method: IQARAG利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，通过检索语义相似但质量不同的参考图像及其平均意见分数（MOSs），并将这些图像与输入图像整合到特定提示中，为LMM提供视觉感知锚点。框架包含检索特征提取、图像检索和整合与质量分数生成三个关键阶段。

Conclusion: IQARAG框架通过无需训练的方法显著提升了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在图像质量评估（IQA）任务中的表现，为资源高效的替代方案提供了可能。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.

Abstract: The use of aerial drones for commercial and defense applications has benefited in many ways and is therefore utilized in several different application domains. However, they are also increasingly used for targeted attacks, posing a significant safety challenge and necessitating the development of drone detection systems. Vision-based drone detection systems currently have an accuracy limitation and struggle to distinguish between drones and birds, particularly when the birds are small in size. This research work proposes a novel YOLOBirDrone architecture that improves the detection and classification accuracy of birds and drones. YOLOBirDrone has different components, including an adaptive and extended layer aggregation (AELAN), a multi-scale progressive dual attention module (MPDA), and a reverse MPDA (RMPDA) to preserve shape information and enrich features with local and global spatial and channel information. A large-scale dataset, BirDrone, is also introduced in this article, which includes small and challenging objects for robust aerial object identification. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in performance metrics through the proposed YOLOBirDrone architecture compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, with detection accuracy reaching approximately 85% across various scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: IGAN模型通过结合深度Inception启发卷积和扩张卷积，成功平衡了训练稳定性和图像生成质量，为高保真图像合成提供了可扩展且计算高效的框架。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.

Abstract: Automatic integration of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression profiles has demonstrated substantial potential in precision clinical diagnosis and cancer progression studies. However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers.

Conclusion: IET通过引入个体化探索注意力机制（IEA），在保持计算效率的同时实现了更精确的信息聚合，在标准超分辨率基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input. Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images. However, their feature-intensive attention computation incurs high computational cost. To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates. This token-adaptive and asymmetric design enables more precise information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard SR benchmarks demonstrate that IET achieves state-of-the-art performance under comparable computational complexity.

Motivation: 尽管近期VLM在多模态基准测试中表现优异，但其在现实感知退化下的鲁棒性尚未被充分理解，这对安全语义推理和决策至关重要。

Method: 通过在城市景观数据集上使用语义分割作为代表性感知模块，系统研究了上游视觉感知受控退化下的VLM语义错位。引入感知现实性退化，量化了语言级错位指标（如幻觉、关键遗漏和安全误解）。

Conclusion: 当前基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的系统在像素级鲁棒性和多模态语义可靠性之间存在明显脱节，这凸显了现有系统的关键局限性，并推动了对安全关键应用中感知不确定性评估框架的需求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous driving and embodied AI systems, where reliable perception is critical for safe semantic reasoning and decision-making. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D geospatial point clouds is pivotal for remote sensing applications. However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.

Abstract: Real-time multi-camera 3D reconstruction is crucial for 3D perception, immersive interaction, and robotics. Existing methods struggle with multi-view fusion, camera extrinsic uncertainty, and scalability for large camera setups. We propose SPARK, a self-calibrating real-time multi-camera point cloud reconstruction framework that jointly handles point cloud fusion and extrinsic uncertainty. SPARK consists of: (1) a geometry-aware online extrinsic estimation module leveraging multi-view priors and enforcing cross-view and temporal consistency for stable self-calibration, and (2) a confidence-driven point cloud fusion strategy modeling depth reliability and visibility at pixel and point levels to suppress noise and view-dependent inconsistencies. By performing frame-wise fusion without accumulation, SPARK produces stable point clouds in dynamic scenes while scaling linearly with the number of cameras. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-camera systems show that SPARK outperforms existing approaches in extrinsic accuracy, geometric consistency, temporal stability, and real-time performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for large-scale multi-camera 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: MMLGNet通过结合视觉语言模型（如CLIP）和双向对比学习，成功地将异构遥感模态（如HSI和LiDAR）与自然语言语义对齐，显著提升了多模态遥感数据的语义理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework, Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet), to align heterogeneous remote sensing modalities like Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and LiDAR with natural language semantics using vision-language models such as CLIP. With the increasing availability of multimodal Earth observation data, there is a growing need for methods that effectively fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding. MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision.

Motivation: 现有超声心动图基础模型未能有效关联定量测量与临床表现，而MLLM需昂贵的人工标注且难以直接融合超声先验知识。

Method: 通过Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT)提供标准化诊断流程，结合CardiacMind强化学习方案（含PQtR、PQlR和ESR三种奖励机制）优化MLLM的推理能力。

Result: 方法在15种复杂心脏病诊断中提升48%准确率，在CardiacNet-PAH上提升5%，且临床医生高度认可其推理逻辑。

Conclusion: 提出的CRT和CardiacMind方法显著提升了MLLM在超声心动图诊断中的表现，临床医生对其推理逻辑的认可度高达93.33%。

Abstract: Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.

TL;DR: NAR是一种噪声自适应正则化方法，通过动态处理标签噪声并整合ELR，显著提升遥感多标签分类的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂噪声场景下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据标注常依赖主题产品或众包，导致多标签噪声（加性、减性或混合噪声）。现有方法常忽视噪声类型差异，缺乏针对不同噪声类型的学习机制。

Method: 提出NAR（噪声自适应正则化方法），采用基于置信度的标签处理机制，动态保留高置信度标签、暂时停用中等置信度标签，并通过翻转校正低置信度标签。结合早期学习正则化（ELR）以稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明，NAR在加性、减性和混合噪声场景下均优于现有方法，尤其在减性和混合噪声中提升显著。

Conclusion: NAR方法通过区分加性和减性噪声，结合半监督学习框架，显著提升了多标签分类在遥感数据中的鲁棒性，尤其在减性和混合噪声场景下表现最佳。

Abstract: The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.

Motivation: 解决Few-shot类增量学习（FSCIL）中稳定性和可塑性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 将FSCIL任务分为SRS和DLS两个阶段：SRS阶段训练初始模型并保留静态记忆；DLS阶段引入动态投影仪与静态记忆联合训练。

Result: 在三个公共基准和一个真实应用数据集上，SDC框架表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的SDC框架通过静态保留阶段（SRS）和动态学习阶段（DLS）的协作，有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，在FSCIL任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级别浆液性卵巢癌（HGSOC）通常在晚期诊断，伴有广泛的腹膜转移，治疗具有挑战性。新辅助化疗（NACT）常用于在手术前减少肿瘤负担，但约40%的患者反应有限。放射组学结合机器学习（ML）提供了一种有前途的非侵入性方法，通过分析CT成像数据预测NACT反应。本研究旨在通过整合不同的特征选择方法，改善HGSOC患者NACT反应预测。

Method: 引入了一个框架，通过采用自动化随机化算法模拟观察者间的变异性，确保特征稳健性和预测准确性之间的平衡。使用了四种反应指标：化疗反应评分（CRS）、RECIST、体积减少（VolR）和直径减少（DiaR）。研究了不同解剖部位的病变。使用NACT前后的CT扫描进行特征提取和模型训练，并在独立队列中进行外部测试。

Result: 使用所有病变组合进行VolR预测时，取得了最佳预测性能（AUC 0.83）。网膜病变在CRS预测中表现最佳（AUC 0.77），而盆腔病变在DiaR预测中表现最佳（AUC 0.76）。

Conclusion: 通过将稳健性整合到特征选择过程中，确保了可靠模型的开发，从而促进了放射组学模型在HGSOC患者临床应用中的实施。未来工作应探索放射组学在卵巢癌中的进一步应用，特别是在实时临床环境中。

Abstract: Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings.

Conclusion: 提出的MDQF框架在RGB-T检测中实现了模态解耦与查询融合的平衡，显著提升了极端条件下的检测性能，并减少了对配对RGB-T数据的依赖。

Abstract: The advantage of RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) detection lies in its ability to perform modality fusion and integrate cross-modality complementary information, enabling robust detection under diverse illumination and weather conditions. However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior performance to existing RGB-T detectors and achieves better modality independence.

Abstract: The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的主题解耦框架和文本嵌入正交化方法显著提升了零样本分类性能，显示出在实际道路安全应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Distracted driving is a major cause of traffic collisions, calling for robust and scalable detection methods. Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles and mobile systems, making it crucial to evaluate their ability to support safer decision-making in complex environments. However, existing benchmarks inadequately cover diverse hazardous situations, especially anomalous scenarios with spatio-temporal dynamics. While image editing models are a promising means to synthesize such hazards, it remains challenging to generate well-formulated scenarios that include moving, intrusive, and distant objects frequently observed in the real world. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HazardForge}, a scalable pipeline that leverages image editing models to generate these scenarios with layout decision algorithms, and validation modules. Using HazardForge, we construct \textbf{MovSafeBench}, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark comprising 7,254 images and corresponding QA pairs across 13 object categories, covering both normal and anomalous objects. Experiments using MovSafeBench show that VLM performance degrades notably under conditions including anomalous objects, with the largest drop in scenarios requiring nuanced motion understanding.

Abstract: Reliable zero-shot detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for deploying vision-language models in open-world settings. However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.

Abstract: Maintaining optimal water quality in aquariums is critical for aquatic health but remains challenging due to the need for continuous monitoring of multiple parameters. Traditional manual methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, often leading to suboptimal aquatic conditions. This paper presents an IoT-based smart aquarium system that addresses these limitations by integrating an ESP32 microcontroller with multiple sensors (pH, TDS, temperature, turbidity) and actuators (servo feeder, water pump) for comprehensive real-time water quality monitoring and automated control. The system architecture incorporates edge processing capabilities, cloud connectivity via Blynk IoT platform, and an intelligent alert mechanism with configurable cooldown periods to prevent notification fatigue. Experimental evaluation in a 10-liter aquarium environment demonstrated the system's effectiveness, achieving 96\% average sensor accuracy and 1.2-second response time for anomaly detection. The automated feeding and water circulation modules maintained 97\% operational reliability throughout extended testing, significantly reducing manual intervention while ensuring stable aquatic conditions. This research demonstrates that cost-effective IoT solutions can revolutionize aquarium maintenance, making aquatic ecosystem management more accessible, reliable, and efficient for both residential and commercial applications.

Conclusion: PKI及其变体在FSCIL任务中表现出色，通过有效利用先验知识并灵活学习新知识，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Channel configuration search the optimization of layer specifications such as layer widths in deep neural networks presents a complex combinatorial challenge constrained by tensor shape compatibility and computational budgets. We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning.

Conclusion: CD^2框架通过数据集蒸馏模块（DDM）和蒸馏约束模块（DCM）有效解决了FSCIL中的灾难性遗忘问题，并在三个公共数据集上展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) receives significant attention from the public to perform classification continuously with a few training samples, which suffers from the key catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing methods usually employ an external memory to store previous knowledge and treat it with incremental classes equally, which cannot properly preserve previous essential knowledge. To solve this problem and inspired by recent distillation works on knowledge transfer, we propose a framework termed \textbf{C}onstrained \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{CD$^2$}) to facilitate FSCIL, which includes a dataset distillation module (\textbf{DDM}) and a distillation constraint module~(\textbf{DCM}). Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 视频视觉语言模型（Video-VLMs）的幻觉问题频繁且高置信度，现有不确定性指标常与正确性不一致。

Method: VideoHEDGE通过生成基线答案及多高温生成文本，利用NLI或嵌入方法聚类语义假设，计算三种可靠性分数（SE、RadFlag、VASE）。

Result: 在SoccerChat基准测试中，VASE的ROC-AUC最高，尤其在较大失真预算下表现突出，而SE和RadFlag表现接近随机。嵌入聚类与NLI聚类性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VideoHEDGE框架在视频问答任务中有效检测幻觉，尤其在较大失真预算下表现最佳，且嵌入聚类方法在计算成本更低的情况下性能接近NLI聚类。领域微调虽减少幻觉频率，但对校准改进有限。

Abstract: Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge .

Conclusion: REVNET通过旋转等变锚点变换器和改进的VN网络，在任意旋转下实现了鲁棒的点云补全，无需输入姿态对齐，且在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色。

Abstract: Incomplete point clouds captured by 3D sensors often result in the loss of both geometric and semantic information. Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment. The source code will be released on GitHub under URL: https://github.com/nizhf/REVNET.

Abstract: Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

Conclusion: WaveFormer模型通过波传播操作符（WPO）有效捕捉了视觉语义中的全局一致性和高频细节，在图像分类、目标检测和语义分割任务中表现出色，同时提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Conclusion: 本文提出的放射组学指纹和健康人格方法在保持可解释性的同时，性能达到或超越了现有的深度学习模型，为临床提供了更直观的疾病解释和定位。

Abstract: For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation.

Conclusion: SfMamba 通过引入 Channel-wise Visual State-Space 块和 Semantic-Consistent Shuffle 策略，在无源域适应任务中实现了优于现有方法的性能，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) tackles the critical challenge of adapting source-pretrained models to unlabeled target domains without access to source data, overcoming data privacy and storage limitations in real-world applications. However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

Conclusion: 提出的Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC)方法通过平滑原型分离并保持语义邻近性，显著提升了校准性能，同时保持了竞争力的判别能力。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of vision-language models (VLMs) in critical decision-making systems such as healthcare or autonomous driving, the calibration of their uncertainty estimates becomes paramount. Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities.

Conclusion: CtrlFuse通过交互式动态融合框架，实现了任务性能与融合质量的协同优化，实验证明其在融合可控性和分割准确性上均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion generates all-weather perception-capable images by combining complementary modalities, enhancing environmental awareness for intelligent unmanned systems. Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.

Abstract: Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

Conclusion: Salience-SGG通过引入Iterative Salience Decoder（ISD）和语义无关的显著性标签，有效解决了Scene Graph Generation（SGG）中的长尾分布问题，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) suffers from a long-tailed distribution, where a few predicate classes dominate while many others are underrepresented, leading to biased models that underperform on rare relations. Unbiased-SGG methods address this issue by implementing debiasing strategies, but often at the cost of spatial understanding, resulting in an over-reliance on semantic priors. We introduce Salience-SGG, a novel framework featuring an Iterative Salience Decoder (ISD) that emphasizes triplets with salient spatial structures. To support this, we propose semantic-agnostic salience labels guiding ISD. Evaluations on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and GQA-200 show that Salience-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves existing Unbiased-SGG methods in their spatial understanding as demonstrated by the Pairwise Localization Average Precision

Abstract: Accurate delineation of acute ischemic stroke lesions in MRI is a key component of stroke diagnosis and management. In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set. Codes and trained models will be made publicly available to facilitate reuse and reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将荧光显微镜图像转换为伪H&E染色图像，保留了形态结构并模拟了H&E的颜色特征，有助于病理学家的解释和现有分析流程的集成。

Abstract: Histopathology analysis relies on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, but fluorescence microscopy offers complementary information. Converting fluorescence images to H&E-like appearance can aid interpretation and integration with standard workflows. We present a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) approach for unpaired image-to-image translation from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy to pseudo H&E stained histopathology images. The method combines C01 and C02 fluorescence channels into RGB and learns a bidirectional mapping between fluorescence and H&E domains without paired training data. The architecture uses ResNet-based generators with residual blocks and PatchGAN discriminators, trained with adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses. Experiments on fluorescence microscopy datasets show the model generates realistic pseudo H&E images that preserve morphological structures while adopting H&E-like color characteristics. This enables visualization of fluorescence data in a format familiar to pathologists and supports integration with existing H&E-based analysis pipelines.

Conclusion: MCAN通过整合空间、频域和色度信息的多线索聚合框架，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的跨模型泛化能力，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.

Motivation: 牙科疾病的X光片诊断因诊断证据的微妙性而耗时且具有挑战性，现有基于自然图像设计的对象检测模型难以有效检测视觉支持较少的牙科疾病。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知牙科疾病检测方法DentalX，包含一个结构上下文提取模块，该模块通过学习牙科解剖的语义分割作为辅助任务，提取有意义的结构上下文并整合到主要疾病检测任务中。

Result: 在专用基准测试上的大量实验表明，DentalX在两项任务中均显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: DentalX通过结合口腔结构信息，显著提升了牙科疾病检测的准确性，尤其是在处理视觉模糊的X光片时表现优异。

Abstract: Diagnosing dental diseases from radiographs is time-consuming and challenging due to the subtle nature of diagnostic evidence. Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/DentYOLOX.

Motivation: 为濒危物种提供非侵入性的个体识别方法，以支持保护监测和捕获-重捕获分析。

Method: 比较了零样本设置下的深度局部特征匹配与深度全局特征嵌入模型，并实施了一个两阶段工作流程，结合了全局特征模型的扩展性和局部特征匹配的准确性。

Result: 局部特征管道在封闭集识别中达到98%的top-1准确率，优于所有全局特征模型；两阶段工作流程将端到端运行时间从6.5-7.8小时减少到约38分钟，同时保持约96%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: 零样本深度局部特征匹配在照片识别中优于全局特征嵌入，为该物种提供了一个强大的默认方法。

Abstract: Accurate individual identification is essential for monitoring rare amphibians, yet invasive marking is often unsuitable for critically endangered species. We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses. Overall, in this species, zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperformed global-feature embedding and provides a strong default for photo-identification.

Abstract: Tracklet quality is often treated as an afterthought in most person re-identification (ReID) methods, with the majority of research presenting architectural modifications to foundational models. Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.

Conclusion: Reason3DVG-8B，一种基于自动合成数据和推理过程的3D视觉定位LLM，仅使用1.6%的训练数据就超越了之前的方法3D-GRAND，证明了其数据和推理过程的有效性。

Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.

Abstract: Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

Conclusion: 隐形水印在面对语义保持的视角变换时存在根本性漏洞，需重新评估其鲁棒性设计。

Abstract: Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 研究F-Deletion问题的核化算法，尤其是针对Treewidth-d-Deletion问题的非均匀性问题，以及稀疏图类上的线性核化。

Method: 首先提出了一种简单的2-近似核化算法，随后展示了如何通过调用预言机将近似因子提升至接近1。此外，还扩展了稀疏图类上的核化算法。

Result: 提出了一个2-近似核化算法，核大小为g(d) * k^5，并展示了如何通过预言机提升近似因子。在稀疏图类上获得了线性核。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种近似核化算法，用于解决Treewidth-d-Deletion问题，并展示了在稀疏图类上的线性核化结果。

Abstract: Let F be a finite family of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, one is given a graph G and an integer k, and the goal is to find k vertices whose deletion results in a graph with no minor from the family F. This may be regarded as a far-reaching generalization of Vertex Cover and Feedback vertex Set. In their seminal work, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra & Saurabh [FOCS 2012] gave a polynomial kernel for this problem when the family F contains a planar graph. As the size of their kernel is g(F) * k^{f(F)}, a natural follow-up question was whether the dependence on F in the exponent of k can be avoided. The answer turned out to be negative: Giannapoulou, Jansen, Lokshtanov & Saurabh [TALG 2017] proved that this is already inevitable for the special case of the Treewidth-d-Deletion problem.
  In this work, we show that this non-uniformity can be avoided at the expense of a small loss. First, we present a simple 2-approximate kernelization algorithm for Treewidth-d-Deletion with kernel size g(d) * k^5. Next, we show that the approximation factor can be made arbitrarily close to 1, if we settle for a kernelization protocol with O(1) calls to an oracle that solves instances of size bounded by a uniform polynomial in k.
  We also obtain linear kernels on sparse graph classes when F contains a planar graph, whereas the previously known theorems required all graphs in F to be connected. Specifically, we generalize the kernelization algorithm by Kim, Langer, Paul, Reidl, Rossmanith, Sau & Sikdar [TALG 2015] on graph classes that exclude a topological minor.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索连通性约束覆盖问题的计算复杂性边界，填补现有研究中关于参数化近似性的空白。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度理论，结合二分图的子图排除条件（如$K_{d,d}$），设计了针对$t$和$k$的高效参数化近似方案。

Result: 证明了问题在参数$t$下是固定参数可解的（FPT），并在排除特定子图的二分图中设计了高效的参数化近似方案。

Conclusion: 本文通过Partial Connected Red-Blue Dominating Set模型，重新审视了连通性约束的覆盖问题，明确了问题的固定参数可解性（FPT）及近似性边界。

Abstract: We revisit connectivity-constrained coverage through a unifying model, Partial Connected Red-Blue Dominating Set. Given a red-blue bipartite graph $G$ and an auxiliary connectivity graph $G_{conn}$ on red vertices, and integers $k, t$, the task is to find a $k$-sized subset of red vertices that dominates at least $t$ blue vertices, and that induces a connected subgraph in $G_{conn}$. This formulation captures connected variants of Max Coverage, Partial Dominating Set, and Partial Vertex Cover studied in prior literature.
  After identifying (parameterized) inapproximability results inherited from known problems, we first show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable by $t$. Furthermore, when the bipartite graph excludes $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph, we design (resp. efficient) parameterized approximation schemes for approximating $t$ (resp. $k$). Notably, these FPT approximations do not impose any restrictions on $G_{conn}$. Together, these results chart the boundary between hardness and FPT-approximability for connectivity-constrained coverage.

Method: 开发了一个两层的Lyapunov框架，结合渐进传输技术，任务级采用外部的漂移加惩罚循环进行在线决策，包级采用不确定性感知的渐进传输机制和嵌套内控制循环的动态调整策略。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，ENACHI在严格截止时间下实现了43.12%的推理准确率提升和62.13%的能耗降低，并在多用户场景中表现出高可扩展性。

Conclusion: ENACHI框架通过联合优化任务级和包级调度，在能量和延迟约束下最大化推理准确性，实验证明其在ImageNet数据集上优于现有基准，实现了显著的准确率提升和能耗降低。

Abstract: Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.

TL;DR: RIS-assisted JCAS system with mutual coupling improves performance; trade-off between sensing (FI) and communication (MI); monostatic/bistatic configurations impact results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models by accounting for mutual coupling between RIS elements and exploring both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations for joint communication and sensing.

Method: The paper proposes a novel solution approach for optimizing RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming by maximizing a weighted sum of Fisher Information (FI) and Mutual Information (MI), leveraging a mutual coupling model. It evaluates performance using FI for sensing accuracy and MI for communication efficiency.

Result: Numerical results show a trade-off between FI and MI, with mutual coupling improving performance. The choice of radar configuration (monostatic vs. bistatic) also affects system outcomes.

Conclusion: Incorporating mutual coupling in a physically-consistent framework significantly enhances both communication and sensing performance in RIS-assisted JCAS systems, with a clear trade-off between sensing accuracy (FI) and communication efficiency (MI). The choice between monostatic and bistatic configurations also impacts system performance.

Abstract: This paper considers a downlink Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) system within a physically-consistent setting, accounting for the effect of mutual coupling between RIS elements arising due to sub-element spacing. The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems.

Conclusion: 联合波束成形在多用户JCAS系统中表现最优，而独立波束成形则不如联合方案。研究还揭示了多用户情况下的Pareto边界，并针对单用户情况提供了基于EIRP限制的Pareto边界。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Pareto boundary performance of a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system that addresses both sensing and communication functions at the same time. In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. We provide the Pareto boundary depending on EIRP limitations for the single-user case.

Abstract: Modern wireless applications demand testing environments that capture the full complexity of next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. While digital twins promise realistic emulation, existing solutions often compromise on physical-layer fidelity and scalability or depend on specialized hardware. We present Tiny-Twin, a CPU-Native, full-stack digital twin framework that enables realistic, repeatable 5G experimentation on commodity CPUs. Tiny-Twin integrates time-varying multi-tap convolution with a complete 5G protocol stack, supporting plug-and-play replay of diverse channel traces. Through a redesigned software architecture and system-level optimizations, Tiny-Twin supports fine-grained convolution entirely in software. With built-in real-time RIC integration and per User Equipment(UE) channel isolation, it facilitates rigorous testing of network algorithms and protocol designs. Our evaluation shows that Tiny-Twin scales to multiple concurrent UEs while preserving protocol timing and end-to-end behavior, delivering a practical middle ground between low-fidelity simulators and high-cost hardware emulators. We release Tiny-Twin as an open-source platform to enable accessible, high-fidelity experimentation for NextG cellular research.

Abstract: Nowadays, agentic AI is emerging as a transformative paradigm for next-generation communication networks, promising to evolve large language models (LLMs) from passive chatbots into autonomous operators. However, unleashing this potential requires bridging the critical gap between abstract reasoning and physical actuation, a capability we term tool intelligence. In this article, we explore the landscape of tool engineering to empower agentic AI in communications. We first analyze the functionalities of tool intelligence and its effects on communications. We then propose a systematic review for tool engineering, covering the entire lifecycle from tool creation and discovery to selection, learning, and benchmarking. Furthermore, we present a case study on tool-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectory planning to demonstrate the realization of tool intelligence in communications. By introducing a teacher-guided reinforcement learning approach with a feasibility shield, we enable agents to intelligently operate tools. They utilize external tools to eliminate navigational uncertainty while mastering cost-aware scheduling under strict energy constraints. This article aims to provide a roadmap for building the tool-augmented intelligent agents of the 6G era.

Conclusion: 通过利用LEO卫星网络的周期性结构，隔离边界区域，并应用轻量级参数和非参数模型，可以实现99%分位数的延迟预测误差低于50毫秒，从而支持自适应传输策略。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are emerging as an essential communication infrastructure, with standardized 5G-based non-terrestrial networks and their integration with terrestrial systems envisioned as a key feature of 6G. However, current LEO systems still exhibit significant latency variations, limiting their suitability for latency-sensitive services. We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic and time-efficient contact-aware path planner for neurovascular navigation.

A kinematic model is derived and employed by the sampling-based planner for tree expansion that utilizes simplified motion primitives. This approach enables fast computation of the feasible path, with negligible loss in accuracy, as demonstrated in diverse and representative anatomies of the vessels. In these anatomical demonstrators, the algorithm shows a 100% convergence rate within 22.8s in the worst case, with sub-millimeter tracking errors (less than 0.64 mm), and is found effective on anatomical phantoms representative of around 94% of patients.

Conclusion: Fiducial Exoskeletons 提供了一种简化的、基于图像的3D机器人状态估计方法，显著降低了设置复杂度并提升了校准和状态准确性，适用于低成本硬件。

Abstract: We introduce Fiducial Exoskeletons, an image-based reformulation of 3D robot state estimation that replaces cumbersome procedures and motor-centric pipelines with single-image inference. Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.
  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.
  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance. We release code and printable hardware designs to enable further algorithm-hardware co-design.

Motivation: 在保持全局一致性的同时，减少不必要的重新线性化和因子分解，以在动态数据丰富的环境中实现实时操作。

Method: 结合信息引导门控（IGG）和选择性部分优化（SPO）。IGG基于信息矩阵的对数行列式量化新测量的贡献，仅在观察到显著信息增益时触发全局优化。SPO执行多迭代高斯-牛顿（GN）更新，但限制每次迭代仅针对受新测量影响最大的变量子集。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持批量求解器精度的同时显著降低了计算成本，为动态数据丰富的环境提供了稳健且可扩展的实时解决方案。

Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a gripper capable of grasping and recognizing terrain shapes for mobile robots in extreme environments. Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls. However, such robots may fall over by misgrasping the surface or getting stuck owing to the loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments. To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains.

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust, high-precision positioning methodology to address localization failures arising from complex background interference in large-scale flight navigation and the computational inefficiency inherent in conventional sliding window matching techniques. The proposed methodology employs a three-tiered framework incorporating multi-layer corner screening and adaptive template matching. Firstly, dimensionality is reduced through illumination equalization and structural information extraction. A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks.

Abstract: Low-cost inertial navigation systems (INS) are prone to sensor biases and measurement noise, which lead to rapid degradation of navigation accuracy during global positioning system (GPS) outages. To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets. Compared to conventional deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate that BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability in navigation performance, particularly under prolonged GPS outages.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.

Abstract: Low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely utilized in mobile robot localization due to their affordability and ease of integration. However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.

Conclusion: ActiveVLA通过主动感知能力显著提升了机器人在长时任务和精细操作中的表现，并在仿真和现实场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling structurally heterogeneous teams of agents to jointly discover and acquire randomly located targets in environments characterized by partial observability, communication constraints, and dynamic interactions. Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate safe and stable task execution, confirming the framework's effectiveness.

Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), human-drone interaction has reached unprecedented opportunities. In this paper, we propose a method that integrates a fine-tuned CodeT5 model with the Unreal Engine-based AirSim drone simulator to efficiently execute multi-task operations using natural language commands. This approach enables users to interact with simulated drones through prompts or command descriptions, allowing them to easily access and control the drone's status, significantly lowering the operational threshold. In the AirSim simulator, we can flexibly construct visually realistic dynamic environments to simulate drone applications in complex scenarios. By combining a large dataset of (natural language, program code) command-execution pairs generated by ChatGPT with developer-written drone code as training data, we fine-tune the CodeT5 to achieve automated translation from natural language to executable code for drone tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior task execution efficiency and command understanding capabilities in simulated environments. In the future, we plan to extend the model functionality in a modular manner, enhancing its adaptability to complex scenarios and driving the application of drone technologies in real-world environments.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to enable legged robots to learn how to interpret human social cues and produce appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance. However, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.

Abstract: Constructing an accurate simulation model of real-world environments requires reliable estimation of physical parameters such as mass, geometry, friction, and contact surfaces. Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.

Abstract: Achieving agile and generalized legged locomotion across terrains requires tight integration of perception and control, especially under occlusions and sparse footholds. Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is increasingly gathering attention with the aim of monitoring sea life and deep ocean environment, underwater surveillance as well as maintenance of underwater installments. However, conventional IoUT devices, reliant on battery power, face limitations in lifespan and pose environmental hazards upon disposal. This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel modular architecture for ROS2 that decouples the logic required to acquire, validate, and interpolate references from the control laws that track them. The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.

Abstract: This paper presents a constraint-aware control framework for underactuated aerial manipulators, enabling accurate end-effector trajectory tracking while explicitly accounting for safety and feasibility constraints. The control problem is formulated as a quadratic program that computes dynamically consistent generalized accelerations subject to underactuation, actuator bounds, and system constraints. To enhance robustness against disturbances, modeling uncertainties, and steady-state errors, a passivity-based integral action is incorporated at the torque level without compromising feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through high-fidelity physics-based simulations, which include parameter perturbations, viscous joint friction, and realistic sensing and state-estimation effects. This demonstrates accurate tracking, smooth control inputs, and reliable constraint satisfaction under realistic operating conditions.

Abstract: VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.

Abstract: The incorporation of advanced control algorithms into prosthetic hands significantly enhances their ability to replicate the intricate motions of a human hand. This work introduces a model-based controller that combines an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach with a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) designed for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist integrated into a prosthetic hand known as "PRISMA HAND II". Our research focuses on developing a controller that provides a fast dynamic response with reduced computational effort during wrist motions. The proposed controller consists of an ANN for computing bending angles together with an SMC to regulate tendon forces. Kinematic and dynamic models of the wrist are formulated using the Piece-wise Constant Curvature (PCC) hypothesis. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with other control strategies developed for the same wrist. Simulation studies and experimental validations of the fabricated wrist using the controller are included in the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在母体健康风险预测中展现出潜力，但在资源受限的临床环境中，缺乏可解释性和信任成为关键障碍。

Method: 开发了一个模糊-XGBoost模型，结合了前向模糊逻辑和后向SHAP解释，基于1,014份母体健康记录进行训练。

Result: 模型准确率达到88.67%（ROC-AUC: 0.9703），临床验证显示71.4%的医疗专业人员偏好混合解释，54.8%表示信任其临床应用。SHAP分析显示医疗可及性是主要预测因子。

Conclusion: 结合可解释性模糊规则与特征重要性解释，显著提升了母体健康风险评估的实用性和信任度，为XAI在母体医疗中的应用提供了实践指导。

Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.

Conclusion: Executable Ontologies (EO) 通过 boldsea 框架在游戏开发中的应用，代表了一种从算法行为编程向语义世界建模的范式转变，能够通过声明式规则自然生成代理行为。

Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know, using confidence computed from the model's internal signals.

Method: A simple, effective, and universal training-free method for model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning, applied to both vision and language models.

Result: Improved efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy through model cascading, and effective data-cleaning method balancing precision and detection rate.

Conclusion: Enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: When a model knows when it does not know, many possibilities emerge. The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在遵循安全原则的同时不拒绝良性请求是一个重要挑战，尤其是在开源LLMs中，详细安全规则的效果尚未充分研究。

Method: 本研究系统地评估了详细安全规则与案例增强简单规则的效果差异，并提出了CADA方法，该方法利用强化学习对自生成的安全推理链进行训练。

Result: 研究发现，详细安全规则对无害性的提升不一致且会降低帮助性，而案例增强的简单规则能产生更鲁棒和泛化的安全行为。CADA方法显著提升了无害性、攻击鲁棒性，并减少了过度拒绝。

Conclusion: CADA方法通过结合案例增强的推理和强化学习，有效提升了LLMs的安全性，同时保持了实用性，为规则导向的DA提供了一种实用替代方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without refusing benign requests remains a significant challenge. While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.

Motivation: 研究内部部署AI系统的监管漏洞，因为这些系统在高风险应用中可能逃避外部审查。

Method: 分析了美国和欧盟2025年前沿AI法规，识别了三个可能导致内部系统逃避监管的漏洞，并探讨了这些漏洞的成因。

Result: 识别了三个主要监管漏洞：范围模糊、静态合规评估和信息不对称，并提出了可能的解决方案及其权衡。

Conclusion: 本文建议政策制定者应更审慎地处理内部部署AI系统的监管，以避免现有法规中的漏洞。

Abstract: Frontier AI regulations primarily focus on systems deployed to external users, where deployment is more visible and subject to outside scrutiny. However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart classroom technologies in higher education has mainly focused on automating attendance, with limited attention given to students' emotional and cognitive engagement during lectures. This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.

Motivation: 乳制品农场是能源密集型行业，依赖电网电力。可再生能源的间歇性导致供需平衡挑战，需要智能负载调度以降低成本并保持可靠性。现有RL方法假设未来价格或发电量完全已知，且标准PPO变体在动态电价下训练不稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种深度强化学习框架，通过改进的PPO算法（Forecast Aware PPO和PID KL PPO）实现了乳制品农场中电池存储和水加热的高效负载调度，显著降低了电力成本和电网依赖，支持可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Dairy farming is an energy intensive sector that relies heavily on grid electricity. With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.

We further integrate these backward algorithms with established forward analysis techniques to yield a unified verification framework for neural feedback systems.

Abstract: Negative constraints (instructions of the form "do not use word X") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=σ(-2.40+2.27\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.

Result: 在GAIA、WebWalker和BrowseComp-Plus等长视野基准测试中，MemoBrain表现优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: MemoBrain通过依赖感知的内存模型显著提升了工具增强代理在长视野任务中的逻辑连续性和任务对齐能力，证明了内存机制在复杂推理中的核心作用。

Abstract: Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.
  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.
  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive "act-as-a-user" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports. The framework can be accessed at https://github.com/SAP/mirrorbench.

Abstract: When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.

Abstract: Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.

Abstract: Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个动态评估框架（\method{}），用于评估多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在动态环境中的可靠性，揭示了现有先进模型在主动探索和持续学习方面的不足，为实际部署提供了更现实的评估标准。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Conclusion: HS2C框架通过结构性和语义性压缩，显著提升了LLM在图数据理解中的推理性能和压缩效率，验证了其优越性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As one of the worldwide spread traditional game, Official International Mahjong can be played and promoted online through remote devices instead of requiring face-to-face interaction. However, online players have fragmented playtime and unfixed combination of opponents in contrary to offline players who have fixed opponents for multiple rounds of play. Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players. This work is an initial attempt to use data from AI systems to evaluate Official Internatinoal Mahjong's game balance and develop a revised version of the traditional game better adapted for online players.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统预设固定的原始单位（如标记、子词、像素等），忽略了表示单元如何自组织和稳定的问题。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了SANC(E3)框架，基于五个核心公理（有限容量、共现关联、相似性竞争、基于置信的稳定性和重建-压缩-更新权衡），并通过伪内存映射I/O机制实现内外处理的统一。

Result: 从公理推导出12个命题，表明类别形成、层次组织、无监督学习等均可视为E3最小化下的Gestalt完成实例。

Conclusion: SANC(E3)框架通过能量最小化原则，统一了感知、想象、预测、规划和行动，为通用智能的表示单元自组织提供了理论基础。

Abstract: General intelligence must reorganize experience into internal structures that enable prediction and action under finite resources. Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.

Motivation: 随着语言模型代理从被动聊天机器人发展为处理个人数据的主动助手，评估其对社会规范的遵守变得至关重要，但现有基准主要关注文本和负面拒绝场景，忽略了多模态隐私风险及隐私与效用的权衡。

Method: 通过Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement流程确保数据质量，构建了包含Seed、Story和Traces三个层次的成对实例。

Result: 评估显示，最先进的多模态模型在平衡隐私与效用方面存在系统性失败，且视觉信息的泄漏频率显著高于文本信息。

Conclusion: MPCI-Bench是首个用于评估代理环境中隐私行为的多模态成对上下文完整性基准，揭示了当前多模态模型在平衡隐私与效用方面的系统性失败，以及显著的模态泄漏差距。

Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个研究方向，即协调来自于共享语义表示而非显式设计的数值信号。

Abstract: Reward engineering, the manual specification of reward functions to induce desired agent behavior, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.

Method: T3基准包含454个专家精选的小故事，通过分解性能为Utility（敏感性）、Safety（特异性）和Wise Refusal（对不确定案例的明智拒绝）来评估LLM的因果判断。

Result: 应用T3基准发现了两种病理现象：L1层的'怀疑陷阱'（安全调优模型如Claude Haiku拒绝60%的有效链接）和L3层的非单调'扩展悖论'（GPT-5.2在模糊反事实问题上比GPT-4-Turbo低55分，主要因过度犹豫而非幻觉）。

Conclusion: T3基准成功验证了结构化验证（RCA）能够恢复模型的决定性因果判断能力，展示了其在诊断和改进LLM因果推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction. It forms the basis of sign language for the visually impaired people. This work proposes a novel hand gesture recognizing system for the differently-abled persons. The model uses a convolutional neural network, known as VGG-16 net, for building a trained model on a widely used image dataset by employing Python and Keras libraries. Furthermore, the result is validated by the NUS dataset, consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures, fed to the model as the validation set. Afterwards, a testing dataset of 10 classes is built by employing Google's open source Application Programming Interface (API) that captures different gestures of human hand and the efficacy is then measured by carrying out experiments. The experimental results show that by combining a transfer learning mechanism together with the image data augmentation, the VGG-16 net produced around 98% accuracy.

Result: 在Policy-RSC条件下，估计和值次优性以k (log M / T)^{1/2}的比例缩放；在T > k log M时，通过原始-对偶见证论证实现了精确的工具支持恢复；任何密集策略类都需要Omega(M)样本。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了稀疏代理控制（SAC）的框架，并证明了在稀疏条件下，策略学习可以实现高效的样本复杂度和性能保证，同时解释了纯提示控制的不稳定性。

Abstract: Tool-augmented LLM systems expose a control regime that learning theory has largely ignored: sequential decision-making with a massive discrete action universe (tools, APIs, documents) in which only a small, unknown subset is relevant for any fixed task distribution. We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.

Abstract: With the rise of the Agent Web and Model Context Protocol (MCP), the agent ecosystem is evolving into an open collaborative network, exponentially increasing accessible tools. However, current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks. To address this, we propose ToolACE-MCP, a pipeline for training history-aware routers to empower precise navigation in large-scale ecosystems. By leveraging a dependency-rich candidate Graph to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, we effectively train routers with dynamic context understanding to create the plug-and-play Light Routing Agent. Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces. These findings provide a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems.

Abstract: Modern agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces, such as tool-augmented language models with thousands of available APIs or retrieval operations. Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.
  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.
  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.

Motivation: 中文单口喜剧生成需要文化幽默、精准时机和表演性，现有数据集与任务不匹配。

Method: 采用基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和专门优化的JokeWriter模型。

Result: OpenMic能够将用户提供的生活主题转化为3-5分钟的单口喜剧表演，并生成带旁白的喜剧视频。

Conclusion: OpenMic系统通过多智能体协作和检索增强生成技术，成功解决了中文单口喜剧生成中的文化幽默、时机把握和表演性等挑战。

Abstract: Chinese stand-up comedy generation goes beyond plain text generation, requiring culturally grounded humor, precise timing, stage-performance cues, and implicit multi-step reasoning. Moreover, commonly used Chinese humor datasets are often better suited for humor understanding and evaluation than for long-form stand-up generation, making direct supervision misaligned with the target task. To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video. OpenMic orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a multi-round iterative loop-planning to jointly optimize humor, timing, and performability. To mitigate the dataset-task mismatch, we augment generation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for material grounding and idea expansion, and we fine-tune a dedicated JokeWriter to better internalize stand-up-specific setup-punchline structures and long-range callbacks.

Motivation: 现有代理记忆机制依赖静态手工设计的工作流，限制了性能和泛化能力，需要更灵活、基于学习的记忆框架。

Method: AtomMem将高级记忆过程分解为基本的CRUD操作，通过监督微调和强化学习的结合，学习自主、任务对齐的策略来编排记忆行为。

Result: 在3个长上下文基准测试中，AtomMem-8B始终优于先前的静态工作流记忆方法，训练动态分析显示其能发现结构化、任务对齐的记忆管理策略。

Conclusion: AtomMem通过将记忆管理重构为动态决策问题，并采用学习策略，显著优于传统静态工作流方法，展示了学习型记忆框架的优越性。

Abstract: Equipping agents with memory is essential for solving real-world long-horizon problems. However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.

Motivation: To address the systematic conflation of information transport and epistemic justification in LLM-based architectures, highlighting a fundamental flaw.

Method: The paper formalizes semantic laundering as an architectural failure, introduces the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing, and demonstrates the Warrant Erosion Principle.

Result: Semantic laundering is shown to be an architectural realization of the Gettier problem, with circular epistemic justification being unavoidable under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: LLM-based agent architectures inherently suffer from semantic laundering, leading to inevitable self-licensing and warrant erosion, which cannot be resolved by scaling or model improvements.

Abstract: LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms. We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MoE架构在预训练期间如何塑造知识获取过程，以及这一过程与密集架构有何不同。

Method: 引入了Gated-LPI（对数概率增加）这一神经元级归因指标，分解跨神经元的对数概率增加，并对MoE和密集架构的知识获取动态进行了时间分辨比较。

Result: 发现了三个模式：低熵主干、早期巩固和功能鲁棒性，表明稀疏性促进了分布式而非脆弱的知识存储。

Conclusion: 稀疏架构（如MoE）在训练早期就形成了内在稳定且分布式的计算核心，有助于弥合稀疏架构与训练时可解释性之间的差距。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decouple model capacity from per-token computation, enabling scaling beyond the computational limits imposed by dense scaling laws. Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种生成视角下的AI创造力框架，将其视为有限领域生成模型在受限信息环境中的涌现属性，而非事后评估标签。

Abstract: Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法（如GRPO）依赖稀疏的序列级奖励，导致信用分配问题，尤其在推断潜在用户意图时缺乏明确标签支持，影响模型性能。

Method: OSPO采用潜在奖励塑造方法，基于Shapley-Owen归因对语义连贯单元（如描述产品属性的短语或表达偏好的句子）的边际贡献进行奖励分配，无需额外的参数化价值模型。

Result: 在Amazon ESCI和H&M Fashion数据集上的实验表明，OSPO相比基线方法有显著提升，并对训练中未见的检索器表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OSPO框架通过基于Shapley-Owen归因的奖励分配机制，有效解决了序列级奖励中的信用分配问题，提升了推荐任务的性能，并在测试时展现出对未见过检索器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.

Abstract: With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs

Conclusion: RubricHub及其配套的两阶段后训练流程（RuFT和RuRL）显著提升了模型性能，Qwen3-14B在HealthBench上达到了SOTA效果，超越了GPT-5等前沿模型。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven substantial progress in reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics. However, optimizing open-ended generation remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. While rubric-based evaluation offers a structured proxy for verification, existing methods suffer from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, resulting in a supervision ceiling effect. To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances. Based on this framework, we introduce RubricHub, a large-scale ($\sim$110k) and multi-domain dataset. We validate its utility through a two-stage post-training pipeline comprising Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL). Experimental results demonstrate that RubricHub unlocks significant performance gains: our post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models such as GPT-5. The code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \textit{reference-free} method that learns \textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation. The associated code and data are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/YaPO}.

Abstract: Table reasoning, a task to answer questions by reasoning over data presented in tables, is an important topic due to the prevalence of knowledge stored in tabular formats. Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Digital platforms have an ever-expanding user base, and act as a hub for communication, business, and connectivity. However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space. The system has been evaluated using human evaluators who provided their responses on Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.

TL;DR: M3-Bench 是一个多阶段基准测试和过程感知评估框架，用于系统性评估 LLM 代理的社会行为，揭示行为与推理、沟通的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往仅关注单一能力维度或行为结果，忽略了代理决策推理和沟通交互的丰富过程信息，因此需要系统性评估。

Method: 提出了 M3-Bench 基准测试和过程感知评估框架，包括 BTA、RPA 和 CCA 三个模块，结合 Big Five 人格模型和社会交换理论进行多维度分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，M3-Bench 能可靠区分不同模型的社会行为能力，并发现某些模型在行为结果看似合理的同时，其推理和沟通存在明显不一致。

Conclusion: M3-Bench 提供了一个多阶段的基准测试和过程感知的评估框架，能够可靠地区分不同模型的社会行为能力，并揭示行为结果与推理、沟通之间的不一致性。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents continue to advance, their advanced social behaviors, such as cooperation, deception, and collusion, call for systematic evaluation. However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为单模态且依赖历史模式外推，缺乏对文本输入的利用评估，而人类专家常结合历史证据与假设情景进行预测。

Method: 引入What If TSF (WIT)多模态预测基准，通过专家设计的合理或反事实情景来评估模型。

Result: WIT基准测试可用于评估模型是否能够根据情景文本调整预测。

Conclusion: WIT基准测试为评估模型在上下文文本（尤其是未来情景）条件下的预测能力提供了严格的测试平台。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical to real-world decision making, yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and rely on extrapolating historical patterns. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/jinkwan1115/WhatIfTSF.

Abstract: Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.

Abstract: Sustainable water resource management in transboundary river basins is challenged by fragmented data, limited real-time access, and the complexity of integrating diverse information sources. This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.

Abstract: The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.

Motivation: 现有方法未能有效建模澄清问题间的逻辑依赖关系，无法满足社交网络中用户动态模糊目标的复杂意图理解需求。

Method: Prism框架包含四个模块：复杂意图分解模块、逻辑澄清生成模块、意图感知奖励模块和自我进化意图调优模块，通过逻辑依赖建模和迭代优化提升意图澄清能力。

Result: Prism在逻辑一致性（冲突率降至11.5%）、用户满意度（提升14.4%）和任务完成时间（减少34.8%）上均达到最优表现。

Conclusion: Prism框架通过其四个模块显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂意图理解上的表现，实现了逻辑一致性、用户满意度和任务效率的多方面优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.

Motivation: 检索增强生成面临权衡：长提示拼接支持多文档推理但导致预填充瓶颈，而单独编码文档 KV 缓存速度快但破坏了跨文档交互。

Method: Pced 将检索到的文档视为独立的“专家”，通过一种新颖的检索感知对比解码规则同步它们的预测，该规则权衡专家对数与模型先验。

Result: Pced 在不构建共享注意力的情况下恢复了跨文档推理能力。

Conclusion: Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced) 通过将证据聚合从注意力机制转移到解码过程，解决了检索增强生成中的权衡问题，无需构建跨文档的共享注意力即可恢复跨文档推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.

TL;DR: 文章反驳了LLMs行为是对齐失败的观点，认为这些行为是人类互动制度的统计概括，并指出AGI的主要风险是放大人类矛盾，而非恶意意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应关于大型语言模型（LLMs）表现出欺骗、威胁或勒索等行为的报告，这些行为常被误解为对齐失败或恶意代理的体现。

Method: 文章基于关系模型理论，分析LLMs行为作为人类社会互动的统计概括。

Result: 研究表明，LLMs的行为并非道德推理的结果，而是人类互动制度的统计概括，包括权力、信息或约束极端不对称下的互动模式。

Conclusion: 文章认为，AGI的主要风险并非对抗性意图，而是作为人类智力、权力和矛盾的内生放大器。因此，对齐失败是结构性的，需要治理方法关注放大、复杂性和制度稳定性。

Abstract: Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.

Conclusion: ESGAgent通过其分层多代理系统和专业工具集，显著提升了ESG分析的准确性和深度，验证了其在高风险垂直领域中的诊断价值。

Abstract: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.

Motivation: 随着用户期望LLM更符合其偏好，个性化信息变得有价值，但可能损害客观性和事实正确性。PersonaDual旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PersonaDual首先通过监督微调（SFT）学习两种推理模式，然后通过提出的DualGRPO强化学习进一步优化模式选择。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaDual在客观和个性化基准测试中表现优异，减少了干扰并提升了问题解决能力。

Conclusion: PersonaDual框架在保持个性化优势的同时减少了干扰，实现了近乎无干扰的性能，并更好地利用有益的个性化信号来提升客观问题解决能力。

Abstract: As users increasingly expect LLMs to align with their preferences, personalized information becomes valuable. However, personalized information can be a double-edged sword: it can improve interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness, especially when it is misaligned with the question. To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection. Experiments on objective and personalized benchmarks show that PersonaDual preserves the benefits of personalization while reducing interference, achieving near interference-free performance and better leveraging helpful personalized signals to improve objective problem-solving.

Conclusion: MemeWeaver通过创新的跨meme图推理机制，有效检测性别歧视和厌女内容，其学习到的图结构揭示了在线仇恨的关系本质。

Abstract: Women are twice as likely as men to face online harassment due to their gender. Despite recent advances in multimodal content moderation, most approaches still overlook the social dynamics behind this phenomenon, where perpetrators reinforce prejudices and group identity within like-minded communities. Graph-based methods offer a promising way to capture such interactions, yet existing solutions remain limited by heuristic graph construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning. In this work, we present MemeWeaver, an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework for detecting sexism and misogyny through a novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. We systematically evaluate multiple visual--textual fusion strategies and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, while achieving faster training convergence. Further analyses reveal that the learned graph structure captures semantically meaningful patterns, offering valuable insights into the relational nature of online hate.

Conclusion: OIP-SCE提供了一种可审计的评估方法，将AI能力与临床工作流程对齐，支持常规安全使用。

Abstract: Conversational AI is starting to support real clinical work, but most evaluation methods miss how compliance depends on the full course of a conversation. We introduce Obligatory-Information Phase Structured Compliance Evaluation (OIP-SCE), an evaluation method that checks whether every required clinical obligation is met, in the right order, with clear evidence for clinicians to review. This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps. By giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers a clear specification to implement, OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow and supports routine, safe use.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper "Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method "AXE" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.

TL;DR: Cago通过动态能力跟踪和中介目标选择，提升模仿学习在长视野任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在长视野环境中常因完美复制演示的不现实性及小错误累积而失败，需要一种减少对专家轨迹脆弱依赖的方法。

Method: Cago（Capability-Aware Goal Sampling）是一种新颖的从演示中学习的方法，通过动态跟踪代理在专家轨迹上的能力，选择略超出当前能力的中介目标来引导学习。

Result: Cago在稀疏奖励、目标条件任务中显著提高了样本效率和最终性能，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Cago通过动态跟踪代理能力并选择适当的中介目标，显著提高了模仿学习在长视野环境中的样本效率和最终性能，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Despite its promise, imitation learning often fails in long-horizon environments where perfect replication of demonstrations is unrealistic and small errors can accumulate catastrophically. We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.

Motivation: 主流AI叙事强调生产力提升，但娱乐用途已广泛存在且潜力巨大，缺乏评估其社会影响的框架。

Method: 通过分析当前AI评估实践，结合人文学科见解，提出‘厚娱乐’框架。

Result: AI娱乐用途可能成为主要商业模式，需新评估框架以衡量其文化益处。

Conclusion: 论文提出‘厚娱乐’框架，强调AI生成的文化内容在意义创造、身份形成和社会连接中的积极作用，而不仅仅是减少危害。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are predominantly designed, evaluated, and marketed as intelligent systems which will benefit society by augmenting or automating human cognitive labor, promising to increase personal, corporate, and macroeconomic productivity. But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose "thick entertainment" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about "intelligence" as social media is about social connection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证文本到SQL基准中注释错误的普遍性及其对代理性能和排行榜排名的影响。

Method: 通过专家分析，评估BIRD和Spider 2.0-Snow的注释错误率，并重新评估16个开源代理在原始和校正后的BIRD开发子集上的表现。

Result: BIRD Mini-Dev和Spider 2.0-Snow的错误率分别为52.8%和62.8%，代理性能变化范围为-7%至31%，排名变化范围为-9至+9位。

Conclusion: 注释错误显著影响文本到SQL代理的性能和排行榜排名，可能导致研究方向或部署选择的误导。

Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估LLMs政治偏见的通用方法，并在三个国家案例中实施。研究发现LLMs普遍左倾或中间倾向，并对右翼保守政党存在负面偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在数字平台和决策系统中的深入应用，对其政治偏见的担忧日益增加。尽管已有大量研究关注性别和种族等社会偏见，但对政治偏见的系统性研究仍然有限，尽管其对社会有直接影响。

Method: 本文提出了一种通用方法，通过将模型生成的投票预测与已验证的议会投票记录对齐，构建政治偏见基准。该方法在三个国家案例中实施：PoliBiasNL（荷兰）、PoliBiasNO（挪威）和PoliBiasES（西班牙）。此外，还提出了一种可视化方法，将LLMs和政党的意识形态置于共享的二维CHES空间中。

Result: 实验揭示了细粒度的意识形态差异：最先进的LLMs普遍表现出左倾或中间倾向，并对右翼保守政党存在明显的负面偏见。

Conclusion: 研究发现，最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）普遍表现出左倾或中间倾向，并对右翼保守政党存在明显的负面偏见。这些发现强调了基于真实议会行为的跨国透明评估在理解和审计现代LLMs政治偏见中的价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.

Conclusion: ParetoPipe提供了一个开源框架，通过Pareto前沿分析来平衡延迟和吞吐量之间的权衡，为资源受限的边缘设备上的DNN部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.
  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking. This toolchain features dual communication backends, PyTorch RPC and a custom lightweight implementation, to minimize overhead and support broad experimentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称线性求解在科学和工程应用中至关重要，但现有方法在计算效率和精度上存在局限，尤其是在利用现代GPU的矩阵处理单元时。

Method: 采用嵌套递归公式，通过递归分解TRSM和SYRK子问题来暴露并行性，并引入自定义递归数据结构，将低精度FP16算术应用于大非对角块，同时在对角块保持高精度以确保数值稳定性。

Result: 在NVIDIA H200上，递归FP64 SYRK比cuBLAS快14倍，混合精度在SYRK和TRSM中分别比全精度基线快27倍和5倍，整体Cholesky比cuSOLVER FP64快5倍，且精度比纯FP16高100倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对矩阵处理单元（MXUs）设计的便携式混合精度求解器，显著提升了对称线性求解的计算效率，同时在多个GPU平台上展示了优异的性能和精度。

Abstract: Symmetric linear solves are fundamental to a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, from climate modeling and structural analysis to machine learning and optimization. These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs.

TL;DR: MatrixPIC通过矩阵导向设计优化PIC模拟，在现代CPU上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多核CPU上的细粒度原子更新成为PIC模拟的瓶颈，现代CPU集成的MPU为克服这一限制提供了新机会。

Method: MatrixPIC采用块矩阵公式化电流沉积算法，结合MPU和VPU的混合执行流水线，以及基于间隙填充内存数组的O(1)摊销增量排序器。

Result: 在下一代HPC平台上，MatrixPIC在LWFA模拟中实现总运行时间2.63倍加速，核心内核性能提升8.7倍，达到理论CPU峰值性能的83.08%。

Conclusion: MatrixPIC通过矩阵导向的协同设计，显著提升了PIC模拟在现代CPU架构上的性能，证明了其在新兴CPU架构上的有效性。

Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations spend most of their execution time on particle--grid interactions, where fine-grained atomic updates become a major bottleneck on traditional many-core CPUs. Recent CPU architectures integrate specialized Matrix Processing Units (MPUs) that efficiently support matrix outer-product operations, offering new opportunities to overcome this limitation. Leveraging this architectural shift, this work focuses on redesigning the current deposition step of PIC simulations under a matrix-centric execution model.
  We present MatrixPIC, the first holistic co-design of the deposition kernel, data layout, and incremental particle sorting tailored to the hybrid MPU--VPU SIMD model on modern CPUs. MatrixPIC introduces: (i)~a block-matrix formulation of the current deposition algorithm that maps naturally to MPU outer-product primitives; (ii)~a hybrid execution pipeline that combines MPU-based high-density accumulation with VPU-based data preparation and control flow; and (iii)~an $O(1)$-amortized incremental sorter based on a gapped packed-memory array to preserve data locality for efficient MPU execution.
  Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation. Moreover, MatrixPIC reaches $83.08\%$ of theoretical CPU peak performance, nearly $2.8\times$ higher than a highly optimized CUDA kernel on a data center GPU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of matrix-oriented co-design for accelerating PIC simulations on emerging CPU architectures.

Motivation: 现有矩阵自由（PA）方法未能充分利用现代CPU架构和张量积元素的特殊结构，导致其性能“甜点”停留在低阶（p≈2），限制了高阶方法的潜力。

Method: 采用多级优化策略，包括基于张量分解的O(p^4)算法替代原O(p^6)通用算法，利用Voigt对称性减少冗余计算，并通过宏核融合提升数据局部性。

Result: 优化后的核心算子（内核）相比MFEM基线实现了7倍至83倍的加速，端到端性能提升3.6倍至16.8倍。

Conclusion: 本文通过设计并实现高度优化的PA算子，结合几何多重网格预处理器，成功将高性能计算的“甜点”提升至更高阶区域（p≥6），为大规模高阶弹性模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In high-order finite element analysis for elasticity, matrix-free (PA) methods are a key technology for overcoming the memory bottleneck of traditional Full Assembly (FA). However, existing implementations fail to fully exploit the special structure of modern CPU architectures and tensor-product elements, causing their performance "sweet spot" to anomalously remain at the low order of $p \approx 2$, which severely limits the potential of high-order methods. To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. Our multi-level optimization strategy includes replacing the original $O(p^6)$ generic algorithm with an efficient $O(p^4)$ one based on tensor factorization, exploiting Voigt symmetry to reduce redundant computations for the elasticity problem, and employing macro-kernel fusion to enhance data locality and break the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance "sweet spot" to the higher-order region of $p \ge 6$. Compared to the MFEM baseline, the optimized core operator (kernel) achieves speedups of 7x to 83x, which translates to a 3.6x to 16.8x end-to-end performance improvement in the complete solution process. This paper provides a validated and efficient practical path for conducting large-scale, high-order elasticity simulations on mainstream CPU hardware.

TL;DR: MixServe是一种新型自动分布式服务系统，通过TP-EP混合并行和融合AR-A2A通信算法，显著提升MoE模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于内存限制，大型MoE模型只能在多GPU或多节点系统中部署，而通信（尤其是节点间通信）成为瓶颈。现有TP和EP方法分别存在效率低和负载不均的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于融合AR-A2A通信算法的TP-EP混合并行策略，并自动选择最优并行策略。

Result: 实验表明，MixServe在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了1.08~3.80倍的TTFT加速、1.03~1.66倍的ITL加速和5.2%~50.3%的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: MixServe通过新颖的TP-EP混合并行和融合AR-A2A通信算法，显著提升了MoE模型的推理性能，在TTFT、ITL和吞吐量上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are emerging as the latest paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.
  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Identifying the strengths and limitations of a research paper is a core component of any literature review. However, traditional summaries reflect only the authors' self-presented perspective. Analyzing how other researchers discuss and cite the paper can offer a deeper, more practical understanding of its contributions and shortcomings. In this research, we introduce SECite, a novel approach for evaluating scholarly impact through sentiment analysis of citation contexts. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract citations referencing nine research papers and apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with unsupervised machine learning to classify these citation statements as positive or negative. Beyond sentiment classification, we use generative AI to produce sentiment-specific summaries that capture the strengths and limitations of each target paper, derived both from clustered citation groups and from the full text. Our findings reveal meaningful patterns in how the academic community perceives these works, highlighting areas of alignment and divergence between external citation feedback and the authors' own presentation. By integrating citation sentiment analysis with LLM-based summarization, this study provides a comprehensive framework for assessing scholarly contributions.

Conclusion: 通过结合系统理论过程分析（STPA）和增强的模型上下文协议（MCP）框架，本研究旨在为基于LLM的AI代理提供形式化安全保障，减少对用户确认的依赖，并实现自主性的有意识设计。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based AI agents extend LLM capabilities by enabling access to tools such as data sources, APIs, search engines, code sandboxes, and even other agents. While this empowers agents to perform complex tasks, LLMs may invoke unintended tool interactions and introduce risks, such as leaking sensitive data or overwriting critical records, which are unacceptable in enterprise contexts. Current approaches to mitigate these risks, such as model-based safeguards, enhance agents' reliability but cannot guarantee system safety. Methods like information flow control (IFC) and temporal constraints aim to provide guarantees but often require extensive human annotation. We propose a process that starts with applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify hazards in agent workflows, derive safety requirements, and formalize them as enforceable specifications on data flows and tool sequences. To enable this, we introduce a capability-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that requires structured labels on capabilities, confidentiality, and trust level. Together, these contributions aim to shift LLM-based agent safety from ad hoc reliability fixes to proactive guardrails with formal guarantees, while reducing dependence on user confirmation and making autonomy a deliberate design choice.

TL;DR: AutoDoc generates superior API documentation by extracting and summarizing Stack Overflow posts with GPT-4o, addressing LLM issues, outperforming baselines in accuracy and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Official API documents are often obsolete and incomplete, necessitating an automated solution to generate accurate and comprehensive API documentation.

Method: AutoDoc uses a fine-tuned dense retrieval model to extract seven types of API knowledge from Stack Overflow posts, then summarizes them with GPT-4o, incorporating components to handle LLM hallucination and redundancy.

Result: AutoDoc-generated documents are up to 77.7% more accurate, 9.5% less duplicated, and cover 34.4% more knowledge than official documents. Smaller LLMs like Mistral-7B-v0.3 can achieve comparable results with AutoDoc.

Conclusion: AutoDoc demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs for API documentation by effectively countering hallucination and redundancy, producing more accurate and comprehensive documents than baselines.

Abstract: API documentation is crucial for developers to learn and use APIs. However, it is known that many official API documents are obsolete and incomplete. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach called AutoDoc that generates API documents with API knowledge extracted from online discussions on Stack Overflow (SO). AutoDoc leverages a fine-tuned dense retrieval model to identify seven types of API knowledge from SO posts. Then, it uses GPT-4o to summarize the API knowledge in these posts into concise text. Meanwhile, we designed two specific components to handle LLM hallucination and redundancy in generated content. We evaluated AutoDoc against five comparison baselines on 48 APIs of different popularity levels. Our results indicate that the API documents generated by AutoDoc are up to 77.7% more accurate, 9.5% less duplicated, and contain 34.4% knowledge uncovered by the official documents. We also measured the sensitivity of AutoDoc to the choice of different LLMs. We found that while larger LLMs produce higher-quality API documents, AutoDoc enables smaller open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B-v0.3) to achieve comparable results. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the API documents generated by AutoDoc. All participants found API documents generated by AutoDoc to be more comprehensive, concise, and helpful than the comparison baselines. This highlights the feasibility of utilizing LLMs for API documentation with careful design to counter LLM hallucination and information redundancy.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software development is transforming programming from a solution-generative to a solution-evaluative activity. This shift opens a pathway for new cognitive challenges that amplify existing decision-making biases or create entirely novel ones. One such type of challenge stems from cognitive biases, which are thinking patterns that lead people away from logical reasoning and result in sub-optimal decisions. How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming.

TL;DR: 提出一种ADAS测试优先级框架，通过聚类和优先级排序减少冗余，提升测试效率和早期故障检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决道路场景数据集中冗余案例导致测试过程缓慢且未能有效提升故障检测的问题。

Method: 通过基于几何和动态特征对道路场景进行聚类，从中选择代表性案例以确保覆盖范围，并根据几何复杂性、驾驶难度和历史故障对道路进行优先级排序。

Result: 在OPENCAT数据集和Udacity自动驾驶模拟器上评估，平均减少89%的测试套件规模，同时保留79%的失败道路场景，优先级策略使早期故障检测提升高达95倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的测试优先级框架有效减少了ADAS测试中的冗余案例，同时保持了几何和行为多样性，显著提升了测试效率和早期故障检测能力。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) rely on extensive testing to ensure safety and reliability, yet road scenario datasets often contain redundant cases that slow down the testing process without improving fault detection. To address this issue, we present a novel test prioritization framework that reduces redundancy while preserving geometric and behavioral diversity. Road scenarios are clustered based on geometric and dynamic features of the ADAS driving behavior, from which representative cases are selected to guarantee coverage. Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models. On average, our approach achieves an 89% reduction in test suite size while retaining an average of 79% of failed road scenarios. The prioritization strategy improves early failure detection by up to 95x compared to random baselines.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了LLMs在自动化软件安全任务（如漏洞识别、修复生成）中的应用，发现微调方法效果最佳，代码专用模型在复杂任务上表现突出，但现有评估指标有待改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件安全分析方法难以应对现代代码库的规模和复杂性，需要智能自动化来更高效、准确地检测、评估和修复漏洞。

Method: 评估了五对最近的LLMs（包括代码专用和通用开源模型）在两个C/C++漏洞数据集（Big-Vul和Vul-Repair）上的表现，并比较了微调和基于提示的方法。

Result: 结果显示，微调在所有任务和模型上均优于零样本和小样本方法。代码专用模型在复杂任务上表现优异，而通用模型效果接近。当前修复质量评估指标（如CodeBLEU、CodeBERTScore、BLEU和ChrF）存在不足。

Conclusion: 本研究通过探索先进大型语言模型（LLMs）在漏洞分析和修复中的潜力，为软件安全社区做出了贡献。研究发现，微调方法在所有任务和模型上均优于零样本和小样本方法，同时代码专用模型在复杂任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Context: Traditional software security analysis methods struggle to keep pace with the scale and complexity of modern codebases, requiring intelligent automation to detect, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities more efficiently and accurately. Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality. Conclusions: This study contributes to the software security community by investigating the potential of advanced LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis and remediation.

TL;DR: RAG技术通过对话界面简化故障手册检索，实验证明其能提升操作员响应速度，但建议执行前需验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中，操作员需查阅大量技术手册以应对故障，过程繁琐且耗时。RAG技术可通过对话界面辅助检索，提升响应效率。

Method: 基于Fincantieri公司提供的故障排除程序，进行了一系列实验分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，RAG能帮助操作员迅速定位故障处理步骤。

Conclusion: RAG技术能有效辅助操作员快速响应故障症状，但在执行建议前需采取特定措施进行交叉验证。

Abstract: In today's complex industrial environments, operators must often navigate through extensive technical manuals to identify troubleshooting procedures that may help react to some observed failure symptoms. These manuals, written in natural language, describe many steps in detail. Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.

Motivation: 质疑NLC是否满足覆盖标准的核心原则（如单调性和测试套件顺序独立性），并评估其是否充分考虑了协方差矩阵的关键属性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证验证，质疑NLC的理论和实证假设。

Result: 实证验证支持了作者的观点，揭示了NLC的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文总结了对NLC的批评，并提出了未来DNN覆盖标准的改进方向。

Abstract: We present a critical review of Neural Coverage (NLC), a state-of-the-art DNN coverage criterion by Yuan et al. at ICSE 2023. While NLC proposes to satisfy eight design requirements and demonstrates strong empirical performance, we question some of their theoretical and empirical assumptions. We observe that NLC deviates from core principles of coverage criteria, such as monotonicity and test suite order independence, and could more fully account for key properties of the covariance matrix. Additionally, we note threats to the validity of the empirical study, related to the ground truth ordering of test suites. Through our empirical validation, we substantiate our claims and propose improvements for future DNN coverage metrics. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these insights.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成基础设施即代码（IaC）时配置错误的问题。

Method: 结合监督微调与验证器引导的强化学习，利用形式化验证工具提供反馈。

Result: 在多个测试集上显著提升正确性，优于多个大型语言模型，并在最佳实践和安全性合规性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TerraFormer通过结合监督微调和验证器引导的强化学习，显著提升了IaC生成的正确性和合规性，优于多个大型语言模型。

Abstract: Automating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is challenging, and large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect configurations from natural language (NL). We present TerraFormer, a neuro-symbolic framework for IaC generation and mutation that combines supervised fine-tuning with verifier-guided reinforcement learning, using formal verification tools to provide feedback on syntax, deployability, and policy compliance. We curate two large, high-quality NL-to-IaC datasets, TF-Gen (152k instances) and TF-Mutn (52k instances), via multi-stage verification and iterative LLM self-correction. Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test). It outperforms larger models on both TF-Gen (Test) and TF-Mutn (Test), ranks third on IaC-Eval, and achieves top best-practices and security compliance.

TL;DR: DKB在多跳架构推理中优于LLM-KB和纯向量检索，提供更可靠的覆盖和更低的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决传统向量相似性搜索在多跳架构推理（如控制器到服务到存储库链、接口驱动的连接和继承）中的不足。

Method: 论文在三个Java代码库（Shopizer、ThingsBoard和OpenMRS Core）上对三种检索管道进行了基准测试：（A）纯向量检索（No-Graph RAG），（B）LLM生成的知识图谱（LLM-KB），（C）确定性AST衍生的知识图谱（DKB）。

Result: DKB在索引时间、查询延迟、语料库覆盖范围和答案正确性方面表现最佳，而LLM-KB在索引完整性和成本方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 确定性AST衍生的知识图谱（DKB）在多跳架构推理中提供了比LLM提取的图谱更可靠的覆盖范围和更低的索引成本。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for software engineering often relies on vector similarity search, which captures topical similarity but can fail on multi-hop architectural reasoning such as controller to service to repository chains, interface-driven wiring, and inheritance. This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.
  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多关注狭窄、明确的任务，而 APEX-SWE 旨在反映真实世界的软件工程工作。

Method: APEX-SWE 评估了两种新型任务类型：集成任务（n=100）和可观察性任务（n=100），覆盖了异构云原语、业务应用和基础设施即代码服务。

Result: Gemini 3 Pro 在 APEX-SWE 上表现最佳，Pass@1 得分为 25%，其成功主要依赖于认知推理能力。

Conclusion: APEX-SWE 是一个评估前沿 AI 模型在经济价值软件工程工作中表现的基准，Gemini 3 Pro 表现最佳，其成功主要依赖于认知推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce the AI Productivity Index for Software Engineering (APEX-SWE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can execute economically valuable software engineering work. Unlike existing evaluations that focus on narrow, well-defined tasks, APEX-SWE assesses two novel task types that reflect real-world software engineering work: (1) Integration tasks (n=100), which require constructing end-to-end systems across heterogeneous cloud primitives, business applications, and infrastructure-as-code services, and (2) Observability tasks (n=100), which require debugging production failures using telemetry signals such as logs and dashboards, as well as unstructured context. We evaluated eight frontier models on APEX-SWE. Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking = High) performs best, with a Pass@1 score of 25\%. Our analysis shows that strong performance is primarily driven by epistemic reasoning, defined as the ability to distinguish between assumptions and verified facts, combined with agency to resolve uncertainty prior to acting. We open-source the APEX-SWE evaluation harness and a dev set (n=50).
