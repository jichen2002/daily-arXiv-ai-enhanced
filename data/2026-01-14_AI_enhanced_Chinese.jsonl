A Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning for Edge Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.\n  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking.

These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup.

Recent CPU architectures integrate specialized Matrix Processing Units (MPUs) that efficiently support matrix outer-product operations, offering new opportunities to overcome this limitation. Leveraging this architectural shift, this work focuses on redesigning the current deposition step of PIC simulations under a matrix-centric execution model.\n  We present MatrixPIC, the first holistic co-design of the deposition kernel, data layout, and incremental particle sorting tailored to the hybrid MPU--VPU SIMD model on modern CPUs. MatrixPIC introduces: (i)~a block-matrix formulation of the current deposition algorithm that maps naturally to MPU outer-product primitives; (ii)~a hybrid execution pipeline that combines MPU-based high-density accumulation with VPU-based data preparation and control flow; and (iii)~an $O(1)$-amortized incremental sorter based on a gapped packed-memory array to preserve data locality for efficient MPU execution.\n  Evaluated on a next-generation HPC platform, MatrixPIC achieves significant performance gains. In Laser-Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) simulations, it delivers up to $2.63\\times$ speedup in total runtime. For third-order deposition, the core kernel is accelerated by $8.7\\times$ over the baseline and $2.0\\times$ over the best hand-optimized VPU implementation.

To address this challenge, we design and implement a highly optimized PA operator within the MFEM framework, deeply integrated with a Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner.

Extensive experiments on mainstream x86 and ARM architectures demonstrate that our method successfully shifts the performance \"sweet spot\" to the higher-order region of $p \\ge 6$.

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ENACHI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5305\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347DNN\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u5305\u7ea7\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u5c42\u7684Lyapunov\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u91c7\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\u5faa\u73af\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5305\u7ea7\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u5185\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cENACHI\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u622a\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8643.12%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c62.13%\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ENACHI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u548c\u5305\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

Deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a 128 core Maxwell GPU and optimized via TensorRT FP16 quantization, the system sustains 28 to 30 frames per second inference at 9.6 W, achieving 97.7 percent violation detection accuracy and 84.9 percent OCR precision across five violation classes, namely signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U turn, and speeding, without manual region of interest calibration. Comparative benchmarking against YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus demonstrates a 10.7 percent mean average precision gain and a 1.4 times accuracy per watt improvement.

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "MixServe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u878d\u5408AR-A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5927\u578bMoE\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u591aGPU\u6216\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u4fe1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709TP\u548cEP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408AR-A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5e76\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMixServe\u5728DeepSeek-R1\u548cQwen3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.08~3.80\u500d\u7684TTFT\u52a0\u901f\u30011.03~1.66\u500d\u7684ITL\u52a0\u901f\u548c5.2%~50.3%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MixServe\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684TP-EP\u6df7\u5408\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u878d\u5408AR-A2A\u901a\u4fe1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728TTFT\u3001ITL\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Abstract shortened to fit into the word limit", "summary": "Let F be a finite family of graphs. In the F-Deletion problem, one is given a graph G and an integer k, and the goal is to find k vertices whose deletion results in a graph with no minor from the family F. This may be regarded as a far-reaching generalization of Vertex Cover and Feedback vertex Set. In their seminal work, Fomin, Lokshtanov, Misra & Saurabh [FOCS 2012] gave a polynomial kernel for this problem when the family F contains a planar graph. As the size of their kernel is g(F) * k^{f(F)}, a natural follow-up question was whether the dependence on F in the exponent of k can be avoided. The answer turned out to be negative: Giannapoulou, Jansen, Lokshtanov & Saurabh [TALG 2017] proved that this is already inevitable for the special case of the Treewidth-d-Deletion problem.\n  In this work, we show that this non-uniformity can be avoided at the expense of a small loss. First, we present a simple 2-approximate kernelization algorithm for Treewidth-d-Deletion with kernel size g(d) * k^5. Next, we show that the approximation factor can be made arbitrarily close to 1, if we settle for a kernelization protocol with O(1) calls to an oracle that solves instances of size bounded by a uniform polynomial in k.\n  We also obtain linear kernels on sparse graph classes when F contains a planar graph, whereas the previously known theorems required all graphs in F to be connected.

While this empowers agents to perform complex tasks, LLMs may invoke unintended tool interactions and introduce risks, such as leaking sensitive data or overwriting critical records, which are unacceptable in enterprise contexts. Current approaches to mitigate these risks, such as model-based safeguards, enhance agents' reliability but cannot guarantee system safety. Methods like information flow control (IFC) and temporal constraints aim to provide guarantees but often require extensive human annotation. We propose a process that starts with applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify hazards in agent workflows, derive safety requirements, and formalize them as enforceable specifications on data flows and tool sequences. To enable this, we introduce a capability-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that requires structured labels on capabilities, confidentiality, and trust level.

To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly.

Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.\n  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.\n  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots.

We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture.

In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas.

This formulation captures connected variants of Max Coverage, Partial Dominating Set, and Partial Vertex Cover studied in prior literature.\n  After identifying (parameterized) inapproximability results inherited from known problems, we first show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable by $t$. Furthermore, when the bipartite graph excludes $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph, we design (resp. efficient) parameterized approximation schemes for approximating $t$ (resp. $k$).

The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches.

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets.

While digital twins promise realistic emulation, existing solutions often compromise on physical-layer fidelity and scalability or depend on specialized hardware. We present Tiny-Twin, a CPU-Native, full-stack digital twin framework that enables realistic, repeatable 5G experimentation on commodity CPUs. Tiny-Twin integrates time-varying multi-tap convolution with a complete 5G protocol stack, supporting plug-and-play replay of diverse channel traces. Through a redesigned software architecture and system-level optimizations, Tiny-Twin supports fine-grained convolution entirely in software.

This shift opens a pathway for new cognitive challenges that amplify existing decision-making biases or create entirely novel ones. One such type of challenge stems from cognitive biases, which are thinking patterns that lead people away from logical reasoning and result in sub-optimal decisions. How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8615\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf914\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf922\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u8c03\u67e5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b048.8%\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d56.4%\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005-LLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8615\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0eLLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u4f20\u9012\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u53163D\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6216\u5938\u5f20\u76843D\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u8651\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u8865\u4e01\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\uff1b\u91cd\u6f14\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8865\u4e01\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\uff1b\u6743\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u6e90\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u6e90\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u3002"}}

Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls.

To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure.

While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.", "AI": {"tldr": "CADA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u62d2\u7edd\u826f\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CADA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002CADA\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "conclusion": "CADA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u5bfc\u5411\u7684DA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u76d1\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u90e8\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9003\u907f\u5916\u90e8\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u6b27\u76df2025\u5e74\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u9003\u907f\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u76d1\u7ba1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u8303\u56f4\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5408\u89c4\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u5176\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u8bae\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u5e94\u66f4\u5ba1\u614e\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5185\u90e8\u90e8\u7f72AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002"}}

Our approach bridges the gap between deformation-based and 2D-editing-based 3D editing methods, addressing their limitations to geometry-related content editing. We leverage two key innovations: deformation guidance utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for consistent geometric modifications and diffusion guidance for content correction and visual quality enhancement. A progressive editing strategy further supports aggressive 3D drag edits. Our method enables a wide range of edits, including motion change, shape adjustment, inpainting, and content extension. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DGS-Drag in various scenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance in geometry-related 3D content editing.

However, current LEO systems still exhibit significant latency variations, limiting their suitability for latency-sensitive services. We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms.

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models.

To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets.

This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%.

Unfortunately, the number, magnitude, and articulation of these descriptions can significantly slow down and complicate the retrieval of the correct procedure during critical incidents. Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems. Results show that RAG can assist operators in reacting promptly to failure symptoms, although specific measures have to be taken into consideration to cross-validate recommendations before actuating them.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u754c\u9762\u7b80\u5316\u6545\u969c\u624b\u518c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5efa\u8bae\u6267\u884c\u524d\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u9700\u67e5\u9605\u5927\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u624b\u518c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002RAG\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u754c\u9762\u8f85\u52a9\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eFincantieri\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAG\u80fd\u5e2e\u52a9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u8fc5\u901f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8f85\u52a9\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u6545\u969c\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5efa\u8bae\u524d\u9700\u91c7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u63aa\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics.

With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdbPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u548cPID\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4e73\u5236\u54c1\u519c\u573a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u5236\u54c1\u519c\u573a\u662f\u80fd\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u7f51\u7535\u529b\u3002\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f9b\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u6765\u4ef7\u683c\u6216\u53d1\u7535\u91cf\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6PPO\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u7535\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u519c\u573a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4PPO\u964d\u4f4e1%\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u6bd4DQN\u4f4e4.8%\uff0c\u6bd4SAC\u4f4e1.5%\u3002\u7535\u6c60\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\uff0cPPO\u51cf\u5c1113.1%\u7535\u7f51\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Forecast Aware PPO\u548cPID KL PPO\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e73\u5236\u54c1\u519c\u573a\u4e2d\u7535\u6c60\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u6c34\u52a0\u70ed\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7535\u529b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7535\u7f51\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

However, point-level maize localization in UAV imagery remains challenging due to (1) extremely small object-to-pixel ratios, typically less than 0.1%, (2) prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images larger than 3000 x 4000 pixels, and (3) agricultural scene-specific complexities such as sparse object distribution and environmental variability that are poorly handled by general-purpose vision models.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT), which replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we present the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset, consisting of 1,928 high-resolution UAV images with approximately 501,000 point annotations collected under real field conditions.\n  Extensive experiments show that AKT achieves an average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%.

However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSNN+InEKF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIMU\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIMU\u56e0\u5176\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06SNN\u4e0eInEKF\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SNN\u4ece\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684IMU\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574InEKF\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408SNN\u548cInEKF\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672cIMU\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks.

Code: https://github.com/gut-puncture", "summary": "Negative constraints (instructions of the form \"do not use word X\") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\u03c3(-2.40+2.27\\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d1f\u6307\u4ee4\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u547d\u540d\u88ab\u7981\u8bcd\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be5\u8bcd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1f\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u201c\u4e0d\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u8bcdX\u201d\uff09\u662f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u6761\u4ef6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u529b\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982logit lens\u6280\u672f\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d1f\u6307\u4ee4\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d1f\u6307\u4ee4\u5931\u8d25\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u529b\u5448\u7d27\u5bc6\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5931\u8d25\uff0887.5%\uff09\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u5931\u8d25\uff0812.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d1f\u7ea6\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u547d\u540d\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u7684\u8bcd\u8bed\u4f1a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be5\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations.

This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.\n  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases.

Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality.

Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.\n  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.\n  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemoBrain\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u56e0\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u5de5\u5177\u4ea7\u7269\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MemoBrain\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6267\u884c\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6765\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAIA\u3001WebWalker\u548cBrowseComp-Plus\u7b49\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMemoBrain\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MemoBrain\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

This approach enables users to interact with simulated drones through prompts or command descriptions, allowing them to easily access and control the drone's status, significantly lowering the operational threshold. In the AirSim simulator, we can flexibly construct visually realistic dynamic environments to simulate drone applications in complex scenarios. By combining a large dataset of (natural language, program code) command-execution pairs generated by ChatGPT with developer-written drone code as training data, we fine-tune the CodeT5 to achieve automated translation from natural language to executable code for drone tasks.

We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion.

However, learning through physical engagement can place a heavy burden on users when the process requires large amounts of human-provided data. To address this, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that enables robots to acquire navigational behaviors in a data-efficient manner and to be controlled via multimodal natural human inputs, specifically gestural and verbal commands. We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data.

Wang", "Yu Han"], "title": "How vehicles change lanes after encountering crashes: Empirical analysis and modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u8f66\u9053\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0d\u907f\u8ba9\u884c\u4e3a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53d8\u9053\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u4f4e\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u65b0\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b10%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet.

However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization.

AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities.

This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as \"Jupiter\", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets.

Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation.

While recent ZSAD approaches leverage additional modalities such as language to generate fine-grained prompts for localisation, vision-only methods remain limited to image-level classification, lacking spatial precision. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., \"an image of an [object class]\"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset, demonstrating strong localisation capabilities without auxiliary modalities and facilitating a shift away from prompt dependence for zero-shot anomaly detection research.

We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer.

Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution.

This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach.

We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning.

To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry.

The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdROS2\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Reference Generator\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u8026\u53c2\u8003\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u590d\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u590d\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5904\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aReference Generator\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u63a5\u6536\u548c\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ros2_control\u94fe\u5f0f\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5355\u70b9\u53c2\u8003\u5199\u5165\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08PD\u91cd\u529b\u8865\u507f\u3001\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff1a(i) \u53c2\u8003\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c(ii) \u53c2\u8003\u751f\u6210\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c(iii) \u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u63d2\u503c\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u7528\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "HS2C\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff08HS2C\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c7\u4e2a\u56fe\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHS2C\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HS2C\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players.

Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u63d0\u5347CNN\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6545\u610f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53d7\u63a7\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6912\u76d0\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Resnet-18\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ec5\u5f15\u516510%\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d01\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process.

Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge.

Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about.

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u957f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ece\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u534f\u8c03\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u800c\u975e\u663e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u503c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck.

Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \\textit{S}tepping \\textit{S}tone \\textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries.

However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented.

Furthermore, the result is validated by the NUS dataset, consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures, fed to the model as the validation set. Afterwards, a testing dataset of 10 classes is built by employing Google's open source Application Programming Interface (API) that captures different gestures of human hand and the efficacy is then measured by carrying out experiments.

To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage \"review\" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance.

We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M.

Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region.

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.\n  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.\n  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6781\u5927\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u7a00\u758f\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u6b63\u4ea4\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u603b\u6570\u5bf9\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u52a8\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection.

However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods.

Given an image stream, our model identifies dynamic regions through motion cues with depth and camera pose priors, then matches static elements against its memory bank. When revisiting familiar locations, CogniMap3D retrieves stored scenes, relocates cameras, and updates memory with new observations.

Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points.

To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical \"spatial grounding bottleneck\" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a \"fluency-accuracy paradox\": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to \"over-interpretation\" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76MoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u4f55\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Gated-LPI\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8de8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9MoE\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4f4e\u71b5\u4e3b\u5e72\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u5de9\u56fa\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982MoE\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5c31\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f25\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features.

While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06AI\u521b\u9020\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u89e3\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u548c\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u7ec4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684AI\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u7b7e\u3002"}}

We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning.

By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance.

Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u8111MRI\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cBiomedCLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u805a\u5408\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5982\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u5382\u5546\u3001\u91c7\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u751f\u7269\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5e8f\u5217\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "method": "MMH\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u5c06MR\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5b9a\u7edf\u4e00\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u9002\u914d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u3002\u5229\u7528BiomedCLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\u98ce\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u57284,163\u4f8bT1\u548cT2\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMH\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u5272\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MMH\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u534f\u8c03\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u5272\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u7ad9\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD).

However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated.

Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance.

However, optimizing open-ended generation remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. While rubric-based evaluation offers a structured proxy for verification, existing methods suffer from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, resulting in a supervision ceiling effect. To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances. Based on this framework, we introduce RubricHub, a large-scale ($\\sim$110k) and multi-domain dataset. We validate its utility through a two-stage post-training pipeline comprising Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL). Experimental results demonstrate that RubricHub unlocks significant performance gains: our post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models such as GPT-5.

However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \\textit{reference-free} method that learns \\textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation.

Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG).

AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AIMC-Spec\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FM\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u4e0b\u5206\u7c7b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u8109\u51b2\u5185\u8c03\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\uff08AIMC\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u3001\u53bb\u566a\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\uff08FM\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u4e0b\u6bd4\u76f8\u4f4d\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "AIMC-Spec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aAIMC\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection.

The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space.

Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "HIPPO\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee4\u724c\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u9891-LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891-LLMs\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7eaf\u6587\u672cLLMs\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4ee4\u724c\u4fee\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHIPPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u4ee4\u724c\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891-LLMs\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHIPPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.51\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "HIPPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891-LLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe3.51\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition.

While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting.

Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "M3SR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u611f\u77e5\u7684Mamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5355\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5355\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230U-Net\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM3SR\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "M3SR\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u5757\u548cU-Net\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u7c97\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7acb\u9762\u7ffb\u65b0\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7701\u53bb\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7acb\u9762\u7ffb\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u53cd\u590d\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684VLM\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u533a\u57df\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5408\u5e76\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528ControlNet\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u53c8\u63d0\u5347\u7acb\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ffb\u65b0\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5efa\u7b51\u5e08\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u65e9\u671f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f20\u8fbe\u7ffb\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u3002"}}

In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use.

This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts.

Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation.

Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality.

Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively.

Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance.

Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%.

Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "IGAN\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GAN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GAN\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u6df1\u5ea6\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684GAN\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff08IGAN\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6Inception\u542f\u53d1\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86dropout\u548c\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "IGAN\u5728CUB-200\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8613.12\u548c15.08\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8628-33%\uff1bIS\u5206\u6570\u4e3a9.27\u548c68.25\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "IGAN\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6Inception\u542f\u53d1\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively.

Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images.

To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates.

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u53cd\u9a73\u4e86LLMs\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6982\u62ec\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51faAGI\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u653e\u5927\u4eba\u7c7b\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u56de\u5e94\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u6216\u52d2\u7d22\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u5e38\u88ab\u8bef\u89e3\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLMs\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6982\u62ec\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u975e\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6982\u62ec\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6743\u529b\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u7aef\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0cAGI\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u529b\u3001\u6743\u529b\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u5185\u751f\u653e\u5927\u5668\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5173\u6ce8\u653e\u5927\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoGo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u53cc\u91cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684SFUDA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u7b56\u7565\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08SFUDA\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LoGo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u7c7b\u5e73\u8861\u539f\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "LoGo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u53cc\u91cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u53cc\u91cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u70b9\u4e91\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper presents the design, development, and validation of a low-cost, scalable GSM-IoT smart pet feeder that enables remote monitoring and control through cellular communication. The device combines with an Arduino microcontroller, a SIM800L GSM module for communication, an ultrasonic sensor for real-time food-level assessment, and a servo mechanism for accurate portion dispensing. A dedicated mobile application was developed using MIT App Inventor which allows owners to send feeding commands and receive real-time status updates. Experimental results demonstrate a 98\\% SMS command success rate, consistent portion dispensing with $\\pm 2.67$\\% variance, and reliable autonomous operation.

We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps.

Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis.

For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate.

We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cago\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u590d\u5236\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u53ca\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u800c\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8106\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Cago\uff08Capability-Aware Goal Sampling\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4ece\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u7565\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "Cago\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Cago\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods struggle with multi-view fusion, camera extrinsic uncertainty, and scalability for large camera setups. We propose SPARK, a self-calibrating real-time multi-camera point cloud reconstruction framework that jointly handles point cloud fusion and extrinsic uncertainty. SPARK consists of: (1) a geometry-aware online extrinsic estimation module leveraging multi-view priors and enforcing cross-view and temporal consistency for stable self-calibration, and (2) a confidence-driven point cloud fusion strategy modeling depth reliability and visibility at pixel and point levels to suppress noise and view-dependent inconsistencies. By performing frame-wise fusion without accumulation, SPARK produces stable point clouds in dynamic scenes while scaling linearly with the number of cameras.

But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about \"intelligence\" as social media is about social connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u5a31\u4e50\u7528\u9014\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u539a\u5a31\u4e50\u2019\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6587\u5316\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41AI\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f3a\u8c03\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5a31\u4e50\u7528\u9014\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524dAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u6587\u5b66\u79d1\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u539a\u5a31\u4e50\u2019\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "AI\u5a31\u4e50\u7528\u9014\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u6587\u5316\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u539a\u5a31\u4e50\u2019\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u610f\u4e49\u521b\u9020\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u5371\u5bb3\u3002"}}

MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation.

To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u666e\u904d\u5de6\u503e\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53f3\u7ffc\u4fdd\u5b88\u653f\u515a\u5b58\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6295\u7968\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bae\u4f1a\u6295\u7968\u8bb0\u5f55\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\uff1aPoliBiasNL\uff08\u8377\u5170\uff09\u3001PoliBiasNO\uff08\u632a\u5a01\uff09\u548cPoliBiasES\uff08\u897f\u73ed\u7259\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06LLMs\u548c\u653f\u515a\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7f6e\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4CHES\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u666e\u904d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5de6\u503e\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53f3\u7ffc\u4fdd\u5b88\u653f\u515a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u666e\u904d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5de6\u503e\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53f3\u7ffc\u4fdd\u5b88\u653f\u515a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8de8\u56fd\u900f\u660e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u73b0\u4ee3LLMs\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods.

As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods.

Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7a33\u5065\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4bHGSOC\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u5316\u7597\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fdAUC\u8fbe0.83\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u6d46\u6db2\u6027\u5375\u5de2\u764c\uff08HGSOC\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u665a\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4f34\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8179\u819c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u5316\u7597\uff08NACT\uff09\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u624b\u672f\u524d\u51cf\u5c11\u80bf\u7624\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f46\u7ea640%\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u53cd\u5e94\u6709\u9650\u3002\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790CT\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4bNACT\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u5584HGSOC\u60a3\u8005NACT\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7279\u5f81\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u53cd\u5e94\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u5316\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u5206\uff08CRS\uff09\u3001RECIST\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\uff08VolR\uff09\u548c\u76f4\u5f84\u51cf\u5c11\uff08DiaR\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u5256\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528NACT\u524d\u540e\u7684CT\u626b\u63cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u75c5\u53d8\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884cVolR\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.83\uff09\u3002\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u5728CRS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUC 0.77\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u76c6\u8154\u75c5\u53d8\u5728DiaR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUC 0.76\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5728HGSOC\u60a3\u8005\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u5728\u5375\u5de2\u764c\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation.

Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence.

However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift.

Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors.

To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution.

We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance.

We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration.

Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment.

Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels.

However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches.

We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features.

Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

Tan"], "title": "Aggregating Diverse Cue Experts for AI-Generated Image Detection", "comment": "Accepted by AAAI 2026", "summary": "The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning.

Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks.

We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses.

Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u62103D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Reason3DVG-8B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u62103D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Reason3DVG-8B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "Reason3DVG-8B\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684LLM-based\u65b9\u6cd53D-GRAND\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u51761.6%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "Reason3DVG-8B\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4dLLM\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281.6%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd53D-GRAND\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u9690\u5f62\u6c34\u5370\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u9690\u5f62\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u590d\u6742\u53bb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572815\u79cd\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u9664\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e14\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9690\u5f62\u6c34\u5370\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}
