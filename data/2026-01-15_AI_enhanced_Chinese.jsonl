Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316GEMM\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bGEMM\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaADSALA\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574GEMM\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684HPC\u8282\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\uff08Intel Cascade Lake\u548cAMD Zen 3\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5728100 MB\u4ee5\u5185\u7684GEMM\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8625%\u81f340%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GEMM\u5728\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfBLAS\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8625%\u81f340%\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVCO\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u884cBFT\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u884cBFT\u4e2d\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u66f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u88ab\u52a8\u89c6\u56fe\u53d8\u66f4\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u6162\u901f\u8282\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u7684VCO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Benders\u5207\u5272\u6c42\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u5907\u4efd\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Microsoft Azure\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cVCO\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e76\u884cBFT\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VCO\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u884cBFT\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This method often produces visual artifacts known as floaters--nearly transparent, disconnected elements that drift in space away from the actual surface. This geometric inaccuracy undermines the reliability of these models for practical applications, which is critical. To address this issue, we introduce TIDI-GS, a new training framework designed to eliminate these floaters. A key benefit of our approach is that it functions as a lightweight plugin for the standard 3DGS pipeline, requiring no major architectural changes and adding minimal overhead to the training process. The core of our method is a floater pruning algorithm--TIDI--that identifies and removes floaters based on several criteria: their consistency across multiple viewpoints, their spatial relationship to other elements, and an importance score learned during training.

Generative AI is emerging as a powerful engine for such transitions. However, we show that Generative AI-driven developments pose a critical pitfall: fairness concerns. In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets.

Obtaining the optimal QoS while minimizing resource consumption remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes the streamlined pathway (SP) model, which is a flow scheduling solution that requires minimal statistical knowledge of the DCN data plane. The SP model utilizes the software-defined networks (SDN) paradigm with less information gathered from the DCN data plane, besides the traditional hash-based flow scheduling mechanism, the Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP). In SDN, the proposed methodology harnesses a minimal yet powerful set of statistical data extracted from the DCN data plane, including port throughput and elephant flow information on the aggregate switches of the DCN fat-tree topology. Several experiments, in addition to theoretical analysis, have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SP model in terms of QoS enhancement.

However, existing timer management schemes suffer from heavy software load, low precision, lack of hardware update support, and overflow. This paper proposes two novel operations for priority queues--update and group sorting--to enable hardware timer management. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first hardware priority queue to support an update operation through the composition and propagation of basic operations to modify the priorities of elements within the queue. The group sorting mechanism ensures correct timing behavior post-overflow by establishing a group boundary priority to alter the sorting process and element insertion positions. Implemented with a hybrid architecture of a one-dimension (1D) systolic array and shift registers, our design is validated through packet-level simulations for flow table timeout management. Results demonstrate that a 4K-depth, 16-bit timer queue achieves over 500 MHz (175 Mpps, 12 ns precision) in a 28nm process and over 300 MHz (116 Mpps) on an FPGA.

However, precise scene understanding and sample-efficient learning from human demonstrations remain critical challenges, severely hindering the applicability and generalizability of existing frameworks. This paper presents a novel RGMP-S, Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy with Spiking features, facilitating both high-level skill reasoning and data-efficient motion synthesis. To ground high-level reasoning in physical reality, we leverage lightweight 2D geometric inductive biases to enable precise 3D scene understanding within the vision-language model. Specifically, we construct a Long-horizon Geometric Prior Skill Selector that effectively aligns the semantic instructions with spatial constraints, ultimately achieving robust generalization in unseen environments. For the data efficiency issue in robotic action generation, we introduce a Recursive Adaptive Spiking Network. We parameterize robot-object interactions via recursive spiking for spatiotemporal consistency, fully distilling long-horizon dynamic features while mitigating the overfitting issue in sparse demonstration scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted across the Maniskill simulation benchmark and three heterogeneous real-world robotic systems, encompassing a custom-developed humanoid, a desktop manipulator, and a commercial robotic platform. Empirical results substantiate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines and validate the efficacy of the proposed modules in diverse generalization scenarios.

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model.

In a UAV-CPN, a UAV functions as a dynamic relay, outsourcing computing tasks from the request zone to an expanded service zone with diverse computing nodes, including vehicle onboard units, edge servers, and dedicated powerful nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks and overcome the \"island effect\" observed in multi-access edge computing. A significant challenge is to quantify computing power performance under complex dynamics of communication and computing. To address this challenge, we introduce task completion probability to capture the capability of UAV-CPNs for task computing.

Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR", "comment": "technical report", "summary": "Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark.

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines.

For the last three problems, these trade-offs give the first fully-dynamic algorithms achieving poly-logarithmic approximation in sub-linear time per operation.\n  The main technical ingredient behind our dynamic hierarchy is a dynamic cut-sparsifier algorithm that can handle vertex splits with low recourse. This is achieved by white-boxing the dynamic cut sparsifier construction of [Abraham et al.

This work investigates whether conventional DSS approaches inadvertently exacerbate the rural digital divide. Through large-scale, 3GPP-compliant non-terrestrial network (NTN) simulations with geographically distributed users, we systematically evaluate standard allocation policies. The results uncover a stark and persistent structural bias: SNR-priority scheduling induces a 1.65x urban-rural access disparity, privileging users with favorable satellite geometry. Counter-intuitively, increasing system bandwidth amplifies rather than alleviates this gap, with disparity rising from 1.0x to 1.65x as resources expand. To remedy this, we propose FairShare, a lightweight, quota-based framework that enforces geographic fairness.

EZInput employs a declarative specification system where developers define input requirements and validation constraints once; the library then handles environment detection, interface rendering, parameter validation, and session persistence across Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, and terminal environments. This \"write once, run anywhere\" architecture enables researchers to prototype in notebooks and deploy identical parameter configurations for batch execution on remote systems without code changes or manual transcription. Parameter persistence, inspired by ImageJ/FIJI and adapted to Python workflows, saves and restores user configurations via lightweight YAML files, eliminating redundant input and producing shareable records that enhance reproducibility.

This process refines the often small but critical details of the model building process, such as which features/patients to include and how clinical categories should be defined. However, this traditional collaboration process is extremely time- and resource-intensive, resulting in only a small fraction of CPMs reaching clinical practice. This challenge intensifies when teams attempt to incorporate unstructured clinical notes, which can contain an enormous number of concepts. To address this challenge, we introduce HACHI, an iterative human-in-the-loop framework that uses AI agents to accelerate the development of fully interpretable CPMs by enabling the exploration of concepts in clinical notes. HACHI alternates between (i) an AI agent rapidly exploring and evaluating candidate concepts in clinical notes and (ii) clinical and domain experts providing feedback to improve the CPM learning process. HACHI defines concepts as simple yes-no questions that are used in linear models, allowing the clinical AI team to transparently review, refine, and validate the CPM learned in each round. In two real-world prediction tasks (acute kidney injury and traumatic brain injury), HACHI outperforms existing approaches, surfaces new clinically relevant concepts not included in commonly-used CPMs, and improves model generalizability across clinical sites and time periods. Furthermore, HACHI reveals the critical role of the clinical AI team, such as directing the AI agent to explore concepts that it had not previously considered, adjusting the granularity of concepts it considers, changing the objective function to better align with the clinical objectives, and identifying issues of data bias and leakage.", "AI": {"tldr": "HACHI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "HACHI\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "HACHI\u5728\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u521b\u4f24\u6027\u8111\u635f\u4f24\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HACHI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408AI\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08CPMs\uff09\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.\n  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

Lyu"], "title": "AI-NativeBench: An Open-Source White-Box Agentic Benchmark Suite for AI-Native Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "The transition from Cloud-Native to AI-Native architectures is fundamentally reshaping software engineering, replacing deterministic microservices with probabilistic agentic services. However, this shift renders traditional black-box evaluation paradigms insufficient: existing benchmarks measure raw model capabilities while remaining blind to system-level execution dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce AI-NativeBench, the first application-centric and white-box AI-Native benchmark suite grounded in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) standards. By treating agentic spans as first-class citizens within distributed traces, our methodology enables granular analysis of engineering characteristics beyond simple capabilities. Leveraging this benchmark across 21 system variants, we uncover critical engineering realities invisible to traditional metrics: a parameter paradox where lightweight models often surpass flagships in protocol adherence, a pervasive inference dominance that renders protocol overhead secondary, and an expensive failure pattern where self-healing mechanisms paradoxically act as cost multipliers on unviable workflows. This work provides the first systematic evidence to guide the transition from measuring model capability to engineering reliable AI-Native systems.

For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5224\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u8f66\u8f86\u7ade\u901f\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\uff08\u5982\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u9884\u5224\u8def\u9762\u6469\u64e6\uff09\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u665a\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u540d\u4e49\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9010\u7279\u5f81\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lexus LC500\u8f66\u8f86\u6d89\u6c34\u7ade\u901f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u6240\u670912\u5708\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u800c\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5931\u63a7\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8f66\u8f86\u7ade\u901f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization.

This problem is motivated by queries arising in the analysis of large-scale mobility datasets. We present several exact and approximate data structures for supporting counting long aggregated visits, as well as conditional and unconditional lower bounds. First, we describe an exact data structure that exhibits a space-time tradeoff, as well as efficient approximate solutions based on sampling and sketching techniques.

However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u907f\u969c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u907f\u969c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5e7f\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u6709\u754c\u95ed\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08NLP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u4e14\u654f\u6377\u7684\u673a\u52a8\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u72ed\u7a84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u907f\u969c\u3002"}}

Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack.

Conventional approaches typically rely on event-specific models and explicit analytical formulations, which limits their adaptability and generalization across previously unseen disturbances. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes DScheLLM, a dynamic scheduling approach that leverages fine-tuned large language models within a dual-system (fast-slow) reasoning architecture to address disturbances of different scales. A unified large language model-based framework is constructed to handle dynamic events, where training datasets for both fast and slow reasoning modes are generated using exact schedules obtained from an operations research solver. The Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B model is subsequently fine-tuned under the hybrid reasoning paradigms using LoRA. Experimental evaluations on standard job shop scheduling benchmarks demonstrate that the fast-thinking mode can efficiently generate high-quality schedules and the slow-thinking mode can produce solver-compatible and well-formatted decision inputs. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents one of the earliest studies applying large language models to job shop scheduling in dynamic environments, highlighting their considerable potential for intelligent and adaptive scheduling optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "DScheLLM\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u6280\u672f\u5bf9Huawei OpenPangu Embedded-7B\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8f66\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6162\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "DScheLLM \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5feb\u901f-\u6162\u901f\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning.

Given a pattern P of length m and a text T of length n, the classical task is to decide whether T contains a length-m substring whose Parikh vector equals that of P . While this existence problem admits a linear-time sliding-window solution, many practical applications require optimization and packing variants beyond mere detection. We present a unified sliding-window framework based on maintaining the Parikh-vector difference between P and the current window of T , enabling permutation matching in O(n + \u03c3) time and O(\u03c3) space, where \u03c3 = |\u03a3|. Building on this foundation, we introduce a combinatorial-optimization variant that we call Maximum Feasible Substring under Pattern Supply (MFSP): find the longest substring S of T whose symbol counts are component-wise bounded by those of P . We show that MFSP can also be solved in O(n + \u03c3) time via a two-pointer feasibility maintenance algorithm, providing an exact packing interpretation of P as a resource budget. Finally, we address non-overlapping occurrence selection by modeling each permutation match as an equal-length interval and proving that a greedy earliest-finishing strategy yields a maximum-cardinality set of disjoint matches, computable in linear time once all matches are enumerated. Our results provide concise, provably correct algorithms with tight bounds, and connect frequency-based string matching to packing-style optimization primitives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6392\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6392\u5217\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6253\u5305\u53d8\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\u7ef4\u62a4\u6a21\u5f0fP\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u7a97\u53e3\u7684Parikh\u5411\u91cf\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6392\u5217\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eMFSP\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u6307\u9488\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5339\u914d\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6700\u65e9\u7ed3\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6392\u5217\u5339\u914d\u3001MFSP\u548c\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5339\u914d\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5747\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6392\u5217\uff08\u6df7\u4e71/\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728O(n + \u03c3)\u65f6\u95f4\u548cO(\u03c3)\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53MFSP\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u5728O(n + \u03c3)\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5339\u914d\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests. It also highlights the importance of providing LLMs with tailored context when employing LLMs for test generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3b\u56e0\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0863%\uff09\u3002\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u9700\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5927\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\uff08\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u548cMistral-Large-Instruct-2407\u4e24\u79cdLLM\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff08\u536063%\uff09\u3002\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982SAP HANA\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff08flakiness\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u3002"}}

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation.

We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflexDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534714.1%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6025\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\u9644\u8fd1\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68af\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u975e\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u653e\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u9053\u8def\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuPlan Test14-hard\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReflexDiffusion\u5728\u9ad8\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8614.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "ReflexDiffusion\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS.

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential.

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage.

Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving.\n  Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data.

The agent reconstructs each user's \"privacy mind\", dynamically activates relevant privacy memory through a contextual filter that emulates bounded rationality, and generates synthetic comments reflecting how that user would likely respond to new privacy scenarios. A complementary LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator, calibrated against an established privacy concern taxonomy, quantifies the faithfulness of generated reasoning.

While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165MoE\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5171\u4eab\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff09\u95f4\u7684\u59a5\u534f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6848\u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8def\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u6ce8\u5165MoE\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries. It achieves 90% precision in defect identification and generates high quality structured fields (average field score 1.6).

This human-centered approach aims to strengthen reviewer expertise and contribute to building a more sustainable scholarly ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u73b0\u6709LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u534f\u52a9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u7f3a\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u5230\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u6076\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a(i) LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5bfc\u5e08\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57f9\u517b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u7684\u957f\u671f\u80fd\u529b\uff1b(ii) LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u534f\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration.

However, during agent inference, existing methods often suffer from (i) locally myopic generation, due to the absence of lookahead, and (ii) trajectory instability, where minor early errors can escalate into divergent reasoning paths. These issues make it difficult to balance global effectiveness and computational efficiency. To address these two issues, we propose meta-adaptive exploration with LLM agents https://github.com/exoskeletonzj/MAXS, a meta-adaptive reasoning framework based on LLM Agents that flexibly integrates tool execution and reasoning planning. MAXS employs a lookahead strategy to extend reasoning paths a few steps ahead, estimating the advantage value of tool usage, and combines step consistency variance and inter-step trend slopes to jointly select stable, consistent, and high-value reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory convergence mechanism that controls computational cost by halting further rollouts once path consistency is achieved, enabling a balance between resource efficiency and global effectiveness in multi-tool reasoning. We conduct extensive empirical studies across three base models (MiMo-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B) and five datasets, demonstrating that MAXS consistently outperforms existing methods in both performance and inference efficiency.

While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u96f6\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9c81\u68d2\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08LDA\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u7ec3\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DANN\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5149\u523b\uff08TPL\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee599-100%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u6279\u6b21\uff1b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7528K=20\u6837\u672c\u5c06\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u6574\u5408\u523092%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u7528K=5\u6837\u672c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u8fbe\u523096.19%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u96f6\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days.

However, current paradigms typically treat the reasoning process as an indivisible sequence, lacking an intrinsic mechanism to quantify step-wise information gain.

In this work, we propose CoT-Flow, a framework that reconceptualizes discrete reasoning steps as a continuous probabilistic flow, quantifying the contribution of each step toward the ground-truth answer. Built on this formulation, CoT-Flow enables two complementary methodologies: flow-guided decoding, which employs a greedy flow-based decoding strategy to extract information-efficient reasoning paths, and flow-based reinforcement learning, which constructs a verifier-free dense reward function.

Existing tools are inadequate to reproduce these bugs due to their inability to manage the specific interleaving at the system call level. To address these challenges, we propose SysPro, a novel approach that automatically extracts relevant system call names from bug reports and identifies their locations in the source code.

However, human-driven responses are often fragmented and reactive, with policies formulated in isolation and adjusted only after outbreaks escalate, undermining proactive intervention and global pandemic mitigation. To address this challenge, here we propose a large language model (LLM) multi-agent policymaking framework that supports coordinated and proactive pandemic control across regions. Within our framework, each administrative region is assigned an LLM agent as an AI policymaking assistant. The agent reasons over region-specific epidemiological dynamics while communicating with other agents to account for cross-regional interdependencies. By integrating real-world data, a pandemic evolution simulator, and structured inter-agent communication, our framework enables agents to jointly explore counterfactual intervention scenarios and synthesize coordinated policy decisions through a closed-loop simulation process. We validate the proposed framework using state-level COVID-19 data from the United States between April and December 2020, together with real-world mobility records and observed policy interventions. Compared with real-world pandemic outcomes, our approach reduces cumulative infections and deaths by up to 63.7% and 40.1%, respectively, at the individual state level, and by 39.0% and 27.0%, respectively, when aggregated across states.

This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods.

The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs.

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u7248LLM\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u65e7\u7248LLM\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u800c\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u65b0\u7248LLM\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5931\u53bb\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff08HITS\u3001SymPrompt\u3001TestSpark\u3001CoverUp\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6393\u4e2a\u7c7b\u548c3,657\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u7eaf\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08\u63d0\u9ad817.72%\uff09\u3001\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff08\u63d0\u9ad819.80%\uff09\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\uff08\u63d0\u9ad820.92%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u4f18\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\u7684LLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u4f18\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose RISER (Router-based Intervention for Steerable Enhancement of Reasoning), a plug-and-play intervention framework that adaptively steers LLM reasoning in activation space. RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model.

Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShortCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ShortCoder\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) 10\u79cdPython\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u91cd\u5199\u548cLLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff1b3) \u6ce8\u5165\u7b80\u6d01\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "ShortCoder\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8618.1%-37.8%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ShortCoder\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728HumanEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration.

The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u6027\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u8d28\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u6a21\u578b\uff08Bakic\u548cXCAT\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u4e73\u817a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u5408\u6210\uff08DBT\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5728\u6295\u5f71\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u63d2\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u516d\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b3\u6beb\u7c73\u7403\u5f62\u75c5\u53d8\u548c6\u6beb\u7c73\u9488\u72b6\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u6ce8\u89c6\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u56e0\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u6709\u6240\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9488\u72b6\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u540e\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u53d7\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u5256\u566a\u58f0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning approaches that typically focus on modifying only final answers are insufficient for LRMs, as they fail to remove sensitive content from intermediate steps, leading to persistent privacy leakage and degraded security. To address these challenges, we propose Sensitive Trajectory Regulation (STaR), a parameter-free, inference-time unlearning framework that achieves robust privacy protection throughout the reasoning process. Specifically, we first identify sensitive content via semantic-aware detection. Then, we inject global safety constraints through secure prompt prefix. Next, we perform trajectory-aware suppression to dynamically block sensitive content across the entire reasoning chain. Finally, we apply token-level adaptive filtering to prevent both exact and paraphrased sensitive tokens during generation. Furthermore, to overcome the inadequacies of existing evaluation protocols, we introduce two metrics: Multi-Decoding Consistency Assessment (MCS), which measures the consistency of unlearning across diverse decoding strategies, and Multi-Granularity Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Evaluation, which quantifies privacy protection at both answer and reasoning-chain levels.

Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5757\u5f0f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5757\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u540e\u671f\u9971\u548c\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5757\u5f0f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08BWSSL\uff09\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u5757\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5757\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5339\u914d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5757\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u671f\u5757\u5219\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u5e76\u5728\u66f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5757\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6df7\u5408\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6c47\u603b\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u5757\u9971\u548c\u548c\u754c\u9762\u5f62\u6210\u4e3a\u5269\u4f59\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u3002"}}

Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks.

Our approach follows a model-based paradigm, using Coloured Timed Petri Nets to represent the scheduling environment, and Maskable Proximal Policy Optimization to enable dynamic decision-making while restricting the agent to feasible actions at each decision point. To simulate realistic industrial conditions, dynamic job arrivals are modeled using a Gamma distribution, which captures complex temporal patterns such as bursts, clustering, and fluctuating workloads. Machine failures are modeled using a Weibull distribution to represent age-dependent degradation and wear-out dynamics. These stochastic models enable the framework to reflect real-world manufacturing scenarios better. In addition, we study two action-masking strategies: a non-gradient approach that overrides the probabilities of invalid actions, and a gradient-based approach that assigns negative gradients to invalid actions within the policy network.

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity.

Recent work therefore explores self-evolution by allowing agents to rewrite their own code or prompts to improve problem-solving ability, but unconstrained optimization often triggers instability, hallucinations, and instruction drift. We propose EvoFSM, a structured self-evolving framework that achieves both adaptability and control by evolving an explicit Finite State Machine (FSM) instead of relying on free-form rewriting. EvoFSM decouples the optimization space into macroscopic Flow (state-transition logic) and microscopic Skill (state-specific behaviors), enabling targeted improvements under clear behavioral boundaries. Guided by a critic mechanism, EvoFSM refines the FSM through a small set of constrained operations, and further incorporates a self-evolving memory that distills successful trajectories as reusable priors and failure patterns as constraints for future queries.

Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faslow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u96c6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faslow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5206\u6790\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684slow4fast-VLN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLN\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on trajectory-based metrics that measure task success, while failing to assess whether agents possess a grounded, transferable model of the environment. To address this gap, we propose Task-to-Quiz (T2Q), a deterministic and automated evaluation paradigm designed to decouple task execution from world-state understanding. We instantiate this paradigm in T2QBench, a suite comprising 30 environments and 1,967 grounded QA pairs across multiple difficulty levels. Our extensive experiments reveal that task success is often a poor proxy for environment understanding, and that current memory machanism can not effectively help agents acquire a grounded model of the environment.

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08CMRM\uff09\u548cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08LPR\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7167\u660e\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u201c\u6062\u590d-\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\u201d\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f66\u724c\u5b57\u7b26\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u5982\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08CMRM\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u69fd\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5b57\u7b26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8c03\u5236\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6062\u590d-\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u901a\u7528VLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u7b26\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08CMRM\uff09\u548cLoRA\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6Omni-R1\u548cOmni-R1-Zero\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u4e3aOmni-R1\uff08\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5SFT+RL\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u548cOmni-R1-Zero\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u3002", "result": "Omni-R1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0cOmni-R1-Zero\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8aOmni-R1\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni-R1\u548cOmni-R1-Zero\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u524d\u8005\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\\% in $S_\u03b1$, +0.86\\% in IOU, and +1.77\\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability.

However, building these models is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. We address this by proposing LEAN-LLM-OPT, a LightwEight AgeNtic workflow construction framework for LLM-assisted large-scale OPTimization auto-formulation. LEAN-LLM-OPT takes as input a problem description together with associated datasets and orchestrates a team of LLM agents to produce an optimization formulation. Specifically, upon receiving a query, two upstream LLM agents dynamically construct a workflow that specifies, step-by-step, how optimization models for similar problems can be formulated. A downstream LLM agent then follows this workflow to generate the final output. Leveraging LLMs' text-processing capabilities and common modeling practices, the workflow decomposes the modeling task into a sequence of structured sub-tasks and offloads mechanical data-handling operations to auxiliary tools. This design alleviates the downstream agent's burden related to planning and data handling, allowing it to focus on the most challenging components that cannot be readily standardized. Extensive simulations show that LEAN-LLM-OPT, instantiated with GPT-4.1 and the open source gpt-oss-20B, achieves strong performance on large-scale optimization modeling tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, in a Singapore Airlines choice-based revenue management use case, LEAN-LLM-OPT demonstrates practical value by achieving leading performance across a range of scenarios.

Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \\textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space.

However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm.

While many of these disruptions originate deep in the supply network, most companies still lack visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers, leaving upstream vulnerabilities undetected until the impact cascades downstream. To overcome this blind-spot and move from reactive recovery to proactive resilience, we introduce a minimally supervised agentic AI framework that autonomously monitors, analyses, and responds to disruptions across extended supply networks. The architecture comprises seven specialised agents powered by large language models and deterministic tools that jointly detect disruption signals from unstructured news, map them to multi-tier supplier networks, evaluate exposure based on network structure, and recommend mitigations such as alternative sourcing options. \\rev{We evaluate the framework across 30 synthesised scenarios covering three automotive manufacturers and five disruption classes. The system achieves high accuracy across core tasks, with F1 scores between 0.962 and 0.991, and performs full end-to-end analyses in a mean of 3.83 minutes at a cost of \\$0.0836 per disruption. Relative to industry benchmarks of multi-day, analyst-driven assessments, this represents a reduction of more than three orders of magnitude in response time.

Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance.

Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u89c4\u5219\u4e25\u683c\u9886\u57df\u518d\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\uff08Adobe Firefly\u3001DALL-E 3\u3001Google Imagen 3\u3001Microsoft Image Generator\u548cMidjourney\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u752830\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a-\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f\u56db\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5171600\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u4f4d\u5efa\u7b51\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u662f\u7f55\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u76842.7\u500d\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\u3002\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff08\u6700\u9ad852%\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e32%\uff0c\u5e73\u574742%\uff09\u3002\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff084/4\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u800c\u5168\u9519\u8bef\uff080/4\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cImagen 3\u5931\u8d25\u6700\u5c11\uff0cMicrosoft Image Generator\u5931\u8d25\u6700\u591a\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u8fc7\u5ea6\u88c5\u9970\u3001\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u590d\u5174\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bef\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c1\u6807\u8bb0\u3001\u5236\u5b9a\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8c28\u614e\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy.

While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead.

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods.

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaGKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347WLI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u7684NBI-WLI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "PaGKD\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7ec4\u7ea7\u539f\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Pro\uff09\u548c\u7ec4\u7ea7\u5bc6\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff08GKD-Den\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u75c5\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6d3e\u751f\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPaGKD\u76f8\u5bf9AUC\u63d0\u5347\u4e863.3%\u30011.1%\u30012.8%\u548c3.2%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PaGKD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ec4\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WLI-only\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.\n  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.\n  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.\n  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.\n  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.\n  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data.

While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector.

One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location.

Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models.

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684DICModel\uff0c\u5728ICT\u9886\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3ICT\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528Mermaid\u5de5\u5177\u548cLLMs\u5408\u6210\u7ea67K\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cICT\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7ea62K\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u548cLLMs\u8054\u5408\u5408\u6210\u7ea61.5K\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec57B\u53c2\u6570\u7684DICModel\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed632B\u53c2\u6570\u7684SOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0cBLEU\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u7ea656.8%\u548c20.8%\uff0c\u5728ICT\u4e13\u5bb6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7Qwen2.5-VL 32B\u6a21\u578b1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DICModel\u5728ICT\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u903b\u8f91\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8ICT\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408Vision Transformer\u5404\u5c42\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408Vision Transformer\u6240\u6709\u5c42\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u70ed\u56fe\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u80fd\u4ece\u4e2d\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCAP uses spectral reconstruction fidelity to prune channels, achieving high compression with minimal accuracy loss.", "motivation": "To measure functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels for efficient network pruning.", "method": "Constructs a complex interaction field by pairing input activations with output-channel activations, transforms it to the frequency domain, and uses a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra to measure channel redundancy.", "result": "Achieves 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with only a 1.67% drop in Top-1 accuracy on VGG16/CIFAR-10.", "conclusion": "Spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression, as demonstrated by the high FLOP and parameter reduction with minimal accuracy drop."}}

Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions.

Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively \"dressing\" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor.

Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR).

Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods.

Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "IDEM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ICP\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5b58\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08IDEM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u521a\u6027\u6210\u5bf93D\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0cIDEM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eRMSE\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5IDEM\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982RMSE\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002"}}

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure.

Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck.

Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRENDER\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c3D\u6e32\u67d3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5177\u8eabAI\u548cVR/AR\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6570\u91cf\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "SRENDER\u5728\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space.
