However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u548cTTC\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\uff08BCs\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u78b0\u649e\u65f6\u95f4TTC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9e\u65f6\u5408\u89c4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08TTC\u4f4e\u4e8e3\u79d2\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8640%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u8f66\u9053\u51b2\u7a81\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5c4f\u969c\u8bc1\u4e66\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u51b2\u7a81\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, their successful implementation requires not only technical robustness but also context-sensitive, co-designed solutions. This paper presents Mobirobot, a socially assistive robot developed to support mobilisation in children recovering from trauma, fractures, or depressive disorders through personalised exercise programmes.\n  Methods: An agile, human-centred development approach guided the iterative design of Mobirobot. Multidisciplinary clinical teams and end users were involved throughout the co-development process, which focused on early integration into real-world paediatric surgical and psychiatric settings. The robot, based on the NAO platform, features a simple setup, adaptable exercise routines with interactive guidance, motivational dialogue, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and no-code system feedback.\n  Results: Deployment in hospital environments enabled the identification of key design requirements and usability constraints. Stakeholder feedback led to refinements in interaction design, movement capabilities, and technical configuration. A feasibility study is currently underway to assess acceptance, usability, and perceived therapeutic benefit, with data collection including questionnaires, behavioural observations, and staff-patient interviews.\n  Discussion: Mobirobot demonstrates how multiprofessional, stakeholder-led development can yield a socially assistive system suited for dynamic inpatient settings. Early-stage findings underscore the importance of contextual integration, robustness, and minimal-intrusion design. While challenges such as sensor limitations and patient recruitment remain, the platform offers a promising foundation for further research and clinical application.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mobirobot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u793e\u4f1a\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u953b\u70bc\u8ba1\u5212\u652f\u6301\u513f\u7ae5\u5eb7\u590d\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u654f\u6377\u3001\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4f4f\u9662\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4f1a\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u513f\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u6cbb\u7597\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6280\u672f\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u654f\u6377\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfcMobirobot\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5165\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u513f\u79d1\u5916\u79d1\u548c\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u4e8eNAO\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u953b\u70bc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6307\u5bfc\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff08GUI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u533b\u9662\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5e2e\u52a9\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6280\u672f\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u95ee\u5377\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u5458\u5de5-\u60a3\u8005\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "conclusion": "Mobirobot\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4f4f\u9662\u73af\u5883\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u60c5\u5883\u6574\u5408\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4fb5\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9650\u5236\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u62db\u52df\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4ed3\u5e93\u3001\u533b\u9662\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u786e\u4fdd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d89\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5730\u533a\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff08N=80\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u4eba\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "SyncTwin\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u540c\u6b653D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5b9e-\u4eff\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528VGGT\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u4f53\u7ea73D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5f69\u8272ICP\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u5b9e-\u4eff-\u5b9e\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSyncTwin\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6293\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SyncTwin\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

As algorithms are increasingly used in decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it is becoming crucial to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. Recent work has addressed the challenge of developing efficient approximation algorithms for fair matroid submodular maximization. However, the best algorithms known so far are only guaranteed to satisfy a relaxed version of the fairness constraints that loses a factor 2, i.e., the problem may ask for $\\ell$ elements with a given attribute, but the algorithm is only guaranteed to find $\\lfloor \\ell/2 \\rfloor$. In particular, there is no provable guarantee when $\\ell=1$, which corresponds to a key special case of perfect matching constraints.\n  In this work, we achieve a new trade-off via an algorithm that gets arbitrarily close to full fairness. Namely, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, we give a constant-factor approximation to fair monotone matroid submodular maximization that in expectation loses only a factor $(1-\\varepsilon)$ in the lower-bound fairness constraint.

While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities.

The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions.

Deployment of laser terminals enables high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite links (ISLs); however, their limited number, slow acquisition, and instability make forming a stable satellite topology difficult. Existing patterns like +Grid and Motif ignore regional traffic, ground station placement, and constellation geometry. Given sparse population distribution on Earth and the isolation of rural areas, traffic patterns are inherently non-uniform, providing an opportunity to orient inter-satellite links (ISLs) according to these traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose Starfield, a novel demand-aware satellite topology design heuristic algorithm supported by mathematical analysis. We first formulate a vector field on the constellation's shell according to traffic flows and define a corresponding Riemannian metric on the spherical manifold of the shell. The metric, combined with the spatial geometry, is used to assign a distance to each potential ISL, which we then aggregate over all demand flows to generate a heuristic for each satellite's link selection. Inspired by +Grid, each satellite selects the link with the minimum Riemannian heuristic along with its corresponding angular links. To evaluate Starfield, we developed a custom, link-aware, and link-configurable packet-level simulator, comparing it against +Grid and Random topologies. For the Phase 1 Starlink, simulation results show up to a 30% reduction in hop count and a 15% improvement in stretch factor across multiple traffic distributions. Moreover, static Starfield, an inter-orbital link matching modification of Starfield, achieves a 20% improvement in stretch factor under realistic traffic patterns compared to +Grid. Experiments further demonstrate Starfield's robustness under traffic demand perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Starfield\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9700\u6c42\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u536b\u661f\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316ISL\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u536b\u661f\u62d3\u6251\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5ffd\u7565\u533a\u57df\u6d41\u91cf\u3001\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u661f\u5ea7\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u800c\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316ISL\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStarfield\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u91cf\u6d41\u6784\u5efa\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728ISL\u5206\u914d\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9ece\u66fc\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cStarfield\u5728Phase 1 Starlink\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c1130%\u8df3\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u534715%\u62c9\u4f38\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u9759\u6001Starfield\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6bd4+Grid\u63d0\u534720%\u62c9\u4f38\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "Starfield\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u536b\u661f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LEO\u661f\u5ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8df3\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\u56e0\u5b50\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d41\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails.

Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing.

However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.\n  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u5370\u8c61\u6d3e\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165VLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u827a\u672f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u4e3a\u521a\u6027\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7eb9\u7406\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u518d\u73b0\u540e\u5370\u8c61\u6d3e\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u62bd\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u8fbe\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece2D\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u5411\u6d41\u573a\u5e76\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u52303D\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d41\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b14\u89e6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u753b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VLM-as-a-Judge\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u827a\u672f\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u6d41\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u5370\u8c61\u6d3e\u98ce\u683c\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u62bd\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u8fbe\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u9762\u7eb9\u7406\u6295\u5f71\u3002"}}

This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9006\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u6570\u548c\u5206\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6784\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6574\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9006\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5c06\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u9006\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5206\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9006\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5206\u6570\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9006\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations.

Published at Pattern Recognition", "summary": "Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines.

The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes.

Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions. Conclusions: EfficientNet-B0 provided a more balanced and computationally efficient performance compared to DenseNet121, making it a strong candidate for clinical deployment.

We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement.

A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "PCN-Rec\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u643a\u5e26\u534f\u5546\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u8fbe98.55%\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u957f\u5c3e\u66dd\u5149\u6216\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bc1\u660e\u643a\u5e26\u534f\u5546\u7ba1\u9053\uff08PCN-Rec\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u7528\u6237\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u8c03\u89e3LLM\u5408\u6210\u63a8\u8350\u5217\u8868\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u82e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4fee\u590d\u751f\u6210\u5408\u89c4\u5217\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728MovieLens-100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPCN-Rec\u5bf9\u53ef\u884c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\u8fbe98.55%\uff08n=551, W=80\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u9a8c\u8bc1/\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u5355LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14NDCG@10\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.021\uff080.403 vs. 0.424\uff09\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff08p<0.05\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "PCN-Rec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6cbb\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u957f\u5c3e\u66dd\u5149\u6216\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7387\uff0898.55%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility.

We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision.

However, scientific workflows impose strict requirements on reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, which are not satisfied by generic LLM-based agents. Unconstrained action generation can lead to silent state changes, non-deterministic executions, and irreproducible experimental results, limiting the applicability of LAMs in scientific settings.\n  In this paper, we propose R-LAM, a reproducibility-constrained framework for applying Large Action Models to scientific workflow automation. R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and explicit provenance tracking to ensure that every action and intermediate artifact is auditable and replayable. The framework supports failure-aware execution loops and controlled workflow forking, enabling iterative experimentation without compromising reproducibility.\n  We implement R-LAM as a lightweight Python framework and release it as an open-source PyPI package to facilitate reproducible research. An experimental evaluation of representative scientific workflows demonstrates that R-LAM improves reproducibility success rates and execution reliability compared to unconstrained LLM-based agents, while retaining adaptive control over workflow execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-LAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5bf9\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86LAMs\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "R-LAM\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5931\u8d25\u611f\u77e5\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u53c9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cR-LAM\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "R-LAM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6eaf\u6e90\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability.

The network resources (e.g., radio access resources at each cell) are owned by the InP, and are shared by the NSTs to provide a service to their mobile users. In this context, we proposed a business model that includes resource allocation and user subscription to NSTs in a competitive setting, and provides, among other things, closed-form expressions for the subscription indicators in equilibrium of each NST at each cell. This model relies on the widely adopted logit model to characterize user subscriptions. However, as a consequence of user mobility and radio propagation, some of the underlying assumptions in the logit model do not hold. Therefore, further research is needed to assess the accuracy of the results provided by the logit model in a mobile radio scenario. We carry out a thorough evaluation of the validity of the model by comparing its results against those obtained through computer simulation.

We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of \"no use\" are treated with suspicion.

The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210RFS\u7684Pfaffian\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u521a\u6027\u9762\u677f\u7684\u6298\u7eb8\u7ed3\u6784\u73b0\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u539a\u677f\u3001\u526a\u7eb8\u548c\u591a\u7247\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u5176\u5faa\u73af\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u9762-\u94f0\u94fe\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5c0f\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u87ba\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u7ec4\u88c5\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u8026\u5408\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u5faa\u73af\u95ed\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5404\u79cdRFS\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u548c\u6298\u53e0\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u521a\u6027\u53ef\u6298\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\uff08RFS\uff09\u7684Pfaffian\u7ea6\u675f\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies.

Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations.

While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions.

By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faViSIL\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0eVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5982BLEU\u6216ROUGE\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u6458\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideo Summary Information Loss (ViSIL)\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u63a8\u65ad\u91cf\u5316\u6458\u8981\u672a\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "ViSIL\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5904\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u63d0\u53477%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ViSIL\u5206\u6570\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cVLM\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6458\u89817%\u7684VQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002"}}

Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Min-Seek\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ef6\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5Min-Seek\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u8fde\u7eed\u952e\u503c\u5bf9\u5e76\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "Min-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u5927\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ee7\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "Min-Seek\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u601d\u8003\u957f\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation.

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TuneCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u70ed\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "TuneCLIP\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u6062\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\uff1b(2) \u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5047\u9634\u6027\u5bf9\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "TuneCLIP\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SigLIP\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982ImageNet\u4e0a+2.5%\uff0cDataComp\u4e0a+1.2%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "TuneCLIP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cdCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance.

However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them.

Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8861\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u8bba\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u6b63\u5f53\u5316AI\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8861\u91cf\u3002"}}

Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases.

However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks.

Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption.

However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution.

We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe.

In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cdLLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5f02\u5473\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6216\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6839\u636e\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6216\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DeepSeek-R1\u3001GPT-5 mini\u3001Llama-3.3\u548cQwen2.5-Code\uff09\u572830\u4e2aJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e5d\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5f02\u5473\uff08\u5982Large Class\u548cLong Method\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5404\u5f02\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e5d\u79cd\u5f02\u5473\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u6216\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u5473\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u662f\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff08Recall\uff09\u8fd8\u662f\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff08Precision\uff09\u3002"}}

However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "OT-Drive \u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728 OOD \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa OT-Drive\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u951a\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08SAG\uff09\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08OT Fusion\uff09\uff0c\u5c06 RGB \u548c\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728 ORFD OOD \u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230 95.16% mIoU\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5 6.35%\uff1b\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230 89.79% mIoU\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf 13.99%\u3002", "conclusion": "OT-Drive \u5728 OOD \u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan.

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one.

This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes.

These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms.

However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes.

A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges.

To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity.

However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions.

We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA.

Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\\%, yielding a mean 57.8\\% reduction in seconds per correct answer.

Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding.

Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required.

To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware.

TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text.

Our results show how embedded software engineering teams are rethinking workflows, roles, and toolchains to enable a sustainable transition toward agentic pipelines and generative AI-augmented development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56e2\u961f\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u53d8\u9769\uff0c\u4f46\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9996\u6b21\u5c06AI\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7126\u70b9\u5c0f\u7ec4\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5934\u8111\u98ce\u66b4\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u56db\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5341\u4f4d\u8d44\u6df1\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u768411\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c14\u9879\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaperScout\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u548cPSPO\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u8bba\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bba\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u9700\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPaperScout\uff0c\u5c06\u8bba\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PSPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPaperScout\u5728\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PaperScout\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08PSPO\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bba\u6587\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We analyze five dimensions of workflow change: productivity, code quality, code editing, code reuse, and context switching.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench.

Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem.

Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u751f\u6210buggy\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u6b63\u786e\u4ee3\u7801\u8fd8\u662f\u719f\u6089\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u66b4\u9732\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ManySStuBs4J\u57fa\u51c6\u548cStack-V2\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Data Portraits\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2dbuggy\u548cfixed\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u5c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "67%\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u672a\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u5f53\u4ec5\u66b4\u9732\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\uff0cfixes\u6bd4bugs\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210buggy\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e8ebuggy\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u66f4\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u800c\u66b4\u9732\u4e8efixes\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u60c5\u51b5\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cdbug-fix\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\\approx 8.2$ tiles at $\u03c4= 0.90$ and AUKC $\\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept.

In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella \"Glass Slipper\" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs \"in the wild\" is complex and multifaceted.

Accepted at The Web Conference (WWW) 2026", "summary": "As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps.

The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis.

Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods.

In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS.

However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses.

Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance.

Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds.

The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet.

The dominant \"retrieve-then-prompt\" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion.

To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives.

However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma.

Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6nEMG\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e14\u5f02\u6784\u7684nEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6ce2\u5f62\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5cf0\u503c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5f62\u72b6\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6nEMG\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection.

Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration.

Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens.

Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings.

Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset.

This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded \"lucky guesses,\" leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance.

These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the \"population bias\" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "C-GRASP \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3 HRV \u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316 Z-score \u548c RSA \u62a4\u680f\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "HRV \u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u795e\u7ecf\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u53d7\u751f\u7406\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u5982 RSA \u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u77ed\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "C-GRASP \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u62a4\u680f\u7684 RAG \u589e\u5f3a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5c06 HRV \u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516b\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f Z-score \u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u975e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728 DREAMER \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684 414 \u6b21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cC-GRASP \u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u89c4\u6a21\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 MedGemma3-thinking\uff09\u5728 4 \u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230 37.3% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c 69.6% \u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08CRC\uff09\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "C-GRASP \u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u9ed1\u76d2\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684 AI \u96c6\u6210\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%.

To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations.

To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments.

Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery.

Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity.

Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4.

To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being \"non-intrusive\". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on \"hard regions\" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data.

However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\\gtrsim25$dB).

The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability.

This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS.

To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent.

While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index).

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts.

Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models.

Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model.

We introduce a novel paradigm, \\emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \\emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion.

Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) \"Grokking\" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM \"guesses\" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be \"guessing\" instead of \"reasoning\". Leveraging this \"guessing\" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness).

While current research predominantly focuses on pedestrian crossing behaviors from a vehicle's perspective, interactions within dense shared spaces remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce FUSE-Bike, the first fully open perception platform of its kind. Equipped with two LiDARs, a camera, and GNSS, it facilitates high-fidelity, close-range data capture directly from a cyclist's viewpoint. Leveraging this platform, we present BikeActions, a novel multi-modal dataset comprising 852 annotated samples across 5 distinct action classes, specifically tailored to improve VRU behavior modeling. We establish a rigorous benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art graph convolution and transformer-based models on our publicly released data splits, establishing the first performance baselines for this challenging task. We release the full dataset together with data curation tools, the open hardware design, and the benchmark code to foster future research in VRU action understanding under https://iv.ee.hm.edu/bikeactions/.", "AI": {"tldr": "FUSE-Bike\u5e73\u53f0\u548cBikeActions\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2dVRU\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8f66\u8f86\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5171\u4eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684VRU\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5907LiDAR\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u548cGNSS\u7684FUSE-Bike\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u91c7\u96c6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b852\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u7684BikeActions\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "FUSE-Bike\u5e73\u53f0\u548cBikeActions\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u4e3aVRU\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u56fe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u4e14\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7b2c\u4e8c\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ea7\u65b9\u9762\uff09\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u7ec7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u7ae0\u8282\u548c\u884c\uff09\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u4ece\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u951a\u70b9\u8de8\u5ea6\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u6b21\u7ea7\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6c14\u6ce1\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6b21\u7ea7\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002"}}

First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states.

Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI.

The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\\% train, 10\\% validation, and 10\\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08FFA-Net/AECR-Net\uff09\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u96fe\u973e/\u70df\u96fe\u4e2d\u4eea\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u8bfb\u6570\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u70df\u96fe\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u96fe\u973e\u548c\u70df\u96fe\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u7d27\u6025\u670d\u52a1\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u4eea\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u6551\u63f4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528FFA-Net\u548cAECR-Net\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eUnreal Engine\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0814,000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u630980%\u8bad\u7ec3\u300110%\u9a8c\u8bc1\u300110%\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5212\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u96fe\u973e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684SSIM\u548cPSNR\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.98\u548c43dB\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff1bAECR-Net\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eFFA-Net\u3002\u70df\u96fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff08FFA-Net\u548cAECR-Net\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u70df\u96fe\u548c\u96fe\u973e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6a21\u62df\u4eea\u8868\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u81ea\u52a8\u8bfb\u6570\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference.

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance.

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users.

DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\u03b2_0 = \u03b2_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eJordan\u66f2\u7ebf\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u540c\u8c03\u7406\u8bba\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u3001\u533a\u57df\u6216\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u6216\u788e\u7247\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5f62\u72b6\u6216\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57Jordan\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u540c\u8c03\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d64-\u66f2\u7ebf\u5019\u9009\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176Betti\u6570\uff08\u03b20=\u03b21=1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fde\u901a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eJordan\u66f2\u7ebf\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49Jordan\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fde\u901a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Action100M\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece120\u4e07\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6559\u5b66\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u4f5c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eV-JEPA 2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u3001\u751f\u6210Tree-of-Captions\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5e27\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7GPT-OSS-120B\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6eSelf-Refine\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u8bc1\u636e\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3VL-JEPA\u6a21\u578b\u5728Action100M\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Action100M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships.

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).", "AI": {"tldr": "Molmo2 \u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u4e13\u6709\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u516c\u5f00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7684\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u4e00\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6253\u5305\u548c\u6d88\u606f\u6811\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u4ee4\u724c\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Molmo2 \u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMolmo2\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen3-VL\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Gemini 3 Pro\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Molmo2 \u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc77\u4e2a\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2\u4e2a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMolmo2\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions.

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements.

To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis.

To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities.

From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.", "AI": {"tldr": "WildRayZer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790-\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u9759\u6001NVS\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5f71\u3001\u865a\u5e7b\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "WildRayZer\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u9759\u6001\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u89e3\u91ca\u521a\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u5c4f\u853d\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u635f\u5931\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "WildRayZer\u5728\u52a8\u6001RealEstate10K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u524d\u9988\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "WildRayZer\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790-\u5408\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77ac\u6001\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u5168\u5e27NVS\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}
