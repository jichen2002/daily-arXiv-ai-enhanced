Therefore, the design process often relies heavily on domain expertise and significant human effort. The majority of current methods are rule-based, requiring the specification of a grammar or a set of primitive components and modules that can be composed to create a design. We propose a novel automated robot design framework, RobotDesignGPT, that leverages the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained vision-language models to automate the robot design synthesis process. Our framework synthesizes an initial robot design from a simple user prompt and a reference image. Our novel visual feedback approach allows us to greatly improve the design quality and reduce unnecessary manual feedback. We demonstrate that our framework can design visually appealing and kinematically valid robots inspired by nature, ranging from legged animals to flying creatures.

A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group.

This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved.

At its core, Proc3D introduces procedural compact graph (PCG), a graph representation of 3D models, that encodes the algorithmic rules and structures necessary for generating the model. This representation exposes key parameters, allowing intuitive manual adjustments via sliders and checkboxes, as well as real-time, automated modifications through natural language prompts using Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate Proc3D's capabilities using two generative approaches: GPT-4o with in-context learning (ICL) and a fine-tuned LLAMA-3 model. Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts.

Earlier approaches primarily rely on geometric alignment procedures, while recent work leverages pretrained 2D diffusion models to model language-conditioned object-object spatial relationships. In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model. Our framework augments language supervision with geometry-aware objectives: a variant of soft-Iterative Closest Point (ICP) term to encourage surface attachment and a penetration loss to discourage interpenetration.

Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.\n  These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1125%\uff0c\u7f3a\u9677\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e2d\uff0cCI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5e38\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3RL\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u9009\u62e9\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684CI/CD\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cRL\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630%\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea625%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u9677\u9057\u6f0f\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u57285%\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8df3\u8fc7\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u53cd\u9988\u5468\u671f\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5931\u8d25\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4f18\u5316CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684CI/CD\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To circumvent the memory limitations associated with evaluating large factorials, the algorithm operates exclusively in the prime-exponent domain. Phase 1 employs a parallel segmented sieve to enumerate primes up to $2n$ and applies Legendre's formula to determine the precise prime factorization of $C(n)$. The primes are grouped by exponent and serialized to disk. Phase 2 reconstructs the final integer using a memory-efficient balanced product tree with chunking. The algorithm runs on a time complexity of $\u0398(n(\\log n)^2)$ bit-operations and a space complexity of $\u0398(n \\log n)$ bits.

However, due to the lengthy prompts and the resource constraints, mobile RAG systems exhibit significantly high response latency. On this issue, one promising approach is to reuse intermediate computational results across different queries to eliminate redundant computation. But most existing approaches, such as KV cache reuse and semantic cache reuse, are designed for cloud settings and perform poorly, overlooking the distinctive characteristics of mobile RAG.\n  We propose PerCache, a novel hierarchical cache solution designed for reducing end-to-end latency of personalized RAG applications on mobile platforms. PerCache adopts a hierarchical architecture that progressively matches similar queries and QKV cache to maximize the reuse of intermediate results at different computing stages. To improve cache hit rate, PerCache applies a predictive method to populate cache with queries that are likely to be raised in the future.

Our key finding is that SimCLR pre-training on just 3,000 unlabeled agricultural images provides a +4.57% accuracy improvement--exceeding the +3.70% gain from hierarchical architecture design. Critically, we show this SSL benefit is architecture-agnostic: applying the same pre-training to Swin-Base yields +4.08%, to ViT-Base +4.20%, confirming practitioners should prioritize domain data collection over architectural choices. Using HierarchicalViT (HVT), a Swin-style hierarchical transformer, we evaluate on three datasets: Cotton Leaf Disease (7 classes, 90.24%), PlantVillage (38 classes, 96.3%), and PlantDoc (27 classes, 87.1%). At matched parameter counts, HVT-Base (78M) achieves 88.91% vs. Swin-Base (88M) at 87.23%, a +1.68% improvement.

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs.

Serving a request requires loading the pre-computed prefix KV cache and generating the first token, defined as the Re-Prefill Phase. Offloading this shared prefix cache to secondary storage is essential for memory scalability. Re-Prefill with offloading suffers from severe I/O bottlenecks in two aspects. First, semantic-aware KV cache pruning algorithms select important tokens in fine granularity, while systems manage I/O in coarse, fixed-size blocks, causing severe read amplification. Second, the sequential dependency between identifying important tokens and loading KV cache creates idle I/O and compute bubbles, under-utilizing system resources.\n  This paper proposes \\textit{ContiguousKV}, a high-performance prefix KV cache offloading system that bridges algorithmic semantics with I/O efficiency to accelerate the Re-Prefill phase. We first introduce \\textit{ContiguousChunk}, a unified data management granularity that aligns KV cache pruning with I/O operations. All the mechanisms critical for I/O performance are performed at the granularity of ContiguousChunk, thereby eliminating read amplification. By exploiting the high similarity in important ContiguousChunk indices across layers, we propose intra- and inter-period asynchronous prefetching to break the sequential dependency between I/O and compute, effectively eliminating idle bubbles. Finally, we propose attention-guided cache management to retain semantically critical prefix data in memory.

However, continued scaling exposes critical limitations in hardware, including constraints on computation, bandwidth, and memory. These dimensions are tightly interconnected, so improvements in one often create bottlenecks in others, making isolated optimizations less effective. Balancing them to maximize system efficiency remains a central challenge in scalable AI design. To address this challenge, we introduce {Computation-Bandwidth-Memory Trade-offs}, termed the {AI Trinity}, a unified paradigm that positions {computation}, {bandwidth}, and {memory} as coequal pillars for next-generation AI infrastructure. AI Trinity enables dynamic allocation of resources across these pillars, alleviating single-resource bottlenecks and adapting to diverse scenarios to optimize system performance. Within this framework, AI Trinity identifies three fundamental trade-offs: (1) {More Computation$\\rightarrow$Less Bandwidth}, wherein computational resources are exploited to reduce data transmission under limited bandwidth conditions, (2) {More Bandwidth$\\rightarrow$Less Memory}, which exploits abundant communication capacity to populate or refresh memory when local storage resources are constrained, and (3) {More Memory$\\rightarrow$Less Computation}, whereby storage capacity are utilized to mitigate redundant computation when computational costs are prohibitive. We illustrate the effectiveness of AI Trinity through representative system designs spanning edge-cloud communication, large-scale distributed training, and model inference. The innovations embodied in AI Trinity advance a new paradigm for scalable AI infrastructure, providing both a conceptual foundation and practical guidance for a broad range of application scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI Trinity\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u4f18\u5316AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5236\u7ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AI Trinity\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u5355\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "result": "AI Trinity\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AI Trinity\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc73D TransUNet\u4eceT1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u5408\u6210\u6269\u6563MRI\u7684FA\u548cMD\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AD\u548cMCI\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u53ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u89c4T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u53ea\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u665a\u671f\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563MRI\uff08dMRI\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u8017\u65f6\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd3D TransUNet\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceT1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u9884\u6d4bFA\u548cMD\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684FA\u548cMD\u56fe\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08SSIM>0.93\uff0cPearson\u76f8\u5173\u6027>0.94\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u5c06AD\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865%\uff0878.75%->83.75%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8f7b\u5ea6\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\uff08MCI\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08\u63d0\u534712.5%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5e38\u89c4T1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u63a8\u65ad\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6269\u6563\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8AD\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $\u03c4^{\u0394,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_\u0394$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f3a\u540c\u6b65\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u8ba8\u673a\u5668\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u610f\u8bc6\u4f53\u9a8c\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Stack Theory\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4ee3\u6570\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u5408\u53d6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u25c7\u0394\uff09\u4e0d\u4fdd\u7559\u5408\u53d6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u5408\u53d6\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u5185\u5bb9\u9700\u8981\u4e24\u4e2a\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u540c\u65f6\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u65f6\u3002\u610f\u8bc6\u5f52\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u786c\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this study, we examine methods to achieve real-time prediction of surgical skill level in real-time based on Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores. Using data acquired from the da Vinci Surgical System, we carry out three main analyses, focusing on model design, their real-time performance, and their skill-level-based cross-validation training. For the model design, we evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal deep learning models for predicting surgical skill levels using synchronized kinematic and vision data. Our models include separate unimodal baselines and fusion architectures that integrate features from both modalities and are evaluated using mean Spearman's correlation coefficients, demonstrating that the fusion model consistently outperforms unimodal models for real-time predictions. For the real-time performance, we observe the prediction's trend over time and highlight correlation with the surgeon's gestures. For the skill-level-based cross-validation, we separately trained models on surgeons with different skill levels, which showed that high-skill demonstrations allow for better performance than those trained on low-skilled ones and generalize well to similarly skilled participants. Our findings show that multimodal learning allows more stable fine-grained evaluation of surgical performance and highlights the value of expert-level training data for model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u624b\u672f\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eOSATS\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u624b\u672f\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9ad8\u6280\u80fd\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u624b\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u666e\u901aNLOS\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa3D\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u548cSSD\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u50cf\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u7ebf\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89c6\u7ebf\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3001\u5371\u9669\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLOS\uff09\u6210\u50cf\u901a\u8fc7\u95f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u201c\u5149\u906e\u6321\u201d\u548c\u201c\u975e\u5149\u906e\u6321\u201d\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\uff08SNLLS\uff09\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SSD\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f17\u591a3D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002SSD\u867d\u7136\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684NLOS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5149\u7167\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u666e\u901a\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\uff08NLOS\uff09\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa3D\u9690\u85cf\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SSD\uff09\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Fast and Compact Cloud Block Store Index with RASK", "comment": null, "summary": "In cloud block store, indexing is on the critical path of I/O operations and typically resides in memory. With the scaling of users and the emergence of denser storage media, the index has become a primary memory consumer, causing memory strain. Our extensive analysis of production traces reveals that write requests exhibit a strong tendency to target continuous block ranges in cloud storage systems. Thus, compared to current per-block indexing, our insight is that we should directly index block ranges (i.e., range-as-a-key) to save memory.\n  In this paper, we propose RASK, a memory-efficient and high-performance tree-structured index that natively indexes ranges. While range-as-a-key offers the potential to save memory and improve performance, realizing this idea is challenging due to the range overlap and range fragmentation issues. To handle range overlap efficiently, RASK introduces the log-structured leaf, combined with range-tailored search and garbage collection. To reduce range fragmentation, RASK employs range-aware split and merge mechanisms. Our evaluations on four production traces show that RASK reduces memory footprint by up to 98.9% and increases throughput by up to 31.0x compared to ten state-of-the-art indexes.", "AI": {"tldr": "RASK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u7d22\u5f15\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u8303\u56f4\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u788e\u7247\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7528\u6237\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u4ecb\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6309\u5757\u7d22\u5f15\u6210\u4e3a\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u751f\u4ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5199\u5165\u8bf7\u6c42\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5757\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u7d22\u5f15\u5757\u8303\u56f4\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "method": "RASK\u91c7\u7528\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7d22\u5f15\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65e5\u5fd7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u5b9a\u5236\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5783\u573e\u56de\u6536\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u8303\u56f4\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8303\u56f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u8303\u56f4\u788e\u7247\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cRASK\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7d22\u5f15\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe98.9%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe31.0\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RASK\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u7d22\u5f15\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the sibling task of estimating a sum over all objects in a set, such as the kernel density estimate (KDE) and the normalizing constant for softmax distributions. While existing solutions provably reduce the sum estimation task to acquiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ most similar vectors, where $n$ is the number of objects, we introduce a novel algorithm that only requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ most similar vectors. Our approach randomly assigns objects to levels with exponentially-decaying probabilities and constructs a vector similarity search data structure for each level. With the top-$k$ objects from each level, we propose an unbiased estimate of the sum and prove a high-probability relative error bound. We run experiments on OpenImages and Amazon Reviews with a vector similar search implementation to show that our method can achieve lower error using less computational time than existing reductions.

Simulation-based study on cost-aware log retention", "summary": "Log data plays a critical role in observability, debugging, and performance monitoring in modern cloud-native systems. In small and early-stage cloud deployments, however, log retention policies are frequently configured far beyond operational requirements, often defaulting to 90 days or more, without explicit consideration of their financial and performance implications. As a result, excessive log retention becomes a hidden and recurring cost.\n  This study examines the financial and operational impact of log retention window selection from a cost-aware perspective. Using synthetic log datasets designed to reflect real-world variability in log volume and access patterns, we evaluate retention windows of 7, 14, 30, and 90 days. The analysis focuses on three metrics: storage cost, operationally useful log ratio, and cost per useful log. Operational usefulness is defined as log data accessed during simulated debugging and incident analysis tasks.\n  The results show that reducing log retention from 90 days to 14 days can lower log storage costs by up to 78 percent while preserving more than 97 percent of operationally useful logs. Longer retention windows provide diminishing operational returns while disproportionately increasing storage cost and query overhead. These findings suggest that modest configuration changes can yield significant cost savings without compromising system reliability.\n  Rather than proposing new logging mechanisms, this work offers a lightweight and accessible framework to help small engineering teams reason about log retention policies through a cost-effectiveness lens. The study aims to encourage more deliberate observability configurations, particularly in resource-constrained cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\uff08\u5982\u4ece90\u5929\u51cf\u81f314\u5929\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0878%\uff09\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff08\u4fdd\u755997%\u65e5\u5fd7\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u88ab\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u8fdc\u8d85\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u9ed8\u8ba490\u5929\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u85cf\u4e14\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u65e5\u5fd7\u91cf\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e867\u300114\u300130\u548c90\u5929\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\u3002\u5206\u6790\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53ca\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u4ece90\u5929\u51cf\u5c11\u523014\u5929\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u8fbe78%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8d85\u8fc797%\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\u5e26\u6765\u9012\u51cf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5ea6\u8c03\u6574\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7a97\u53e3\uff08\u5982\u4ece90\u5929\u51cf\u5c11\u523014\u5929\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe78%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8d85\u8fc797%\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6709\u7528\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models.

A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy.

They excel in performing simple and repetitive unimanual tasks but still face challenges with bimanual manipulation. This difficulty arises from the complexities of coordinating dual arms and handling multi-stage processes. Recent integration of generative models into imitation learning (IL) has made progress in tackling specific challenges. However, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while also emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In multi-stage tasks, failures or delays at any stage can cascade over time, impacting the success and efficiency of subsequent sub-stages and ultimately hindering overall task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel keypose-conditioned coordination-aware consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. Our framework instantiates hierarchical imitation learning with a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes serve as sub-goals for trajectory generation, indicating targets for individual sub-stages. The trajectory generator is formulated as a consistency model, generating action sequences based on historical observations and predicted keyposes in a single inference step. In particular, we devise an innovative approach for identifying bimanual keyposes, considering both robot-centric action features and task-centric operation styles. Simulation and real-world experiments illustrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rates and operational efficiency.

In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

Because of its $\\mathrm{NP}$-hardness, one often turns to heuristics for good solutions. Many such heuristics have been empirically tested and perform rather well. However, it is not well understood why their results are so good or even what guarantees they can offer regarding their runtime or the quality of their results. For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^4\\log^2(n)\\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum.

While recent systems have decoupled the prefill and decode stages to improve throughput, they still rely on unified scheduling policies that fail to adapt to heterogeneous workload characteristics. We observe that prompt-length variations lead to distinct performance bottlenecks, motivating an adaptive scheduling strategy. PLA-Serve disaggregates multi-turn long-prefill requests from short-prefill ones and introduces a length-aware smart batching mechanism for short-prefill workloads. It adopts a dual-queue design that supports temporal disaggregation on a single prefill instance or spatial disaggregation across multiple instances. For short-prefill batches, a batch waiting window and CUDA Graph-based clustering mitigate interference from heterogeneous computation, reducing batching delay and lowering average latency. In real multi-turn workloads, PLA-Serve reduces prefill latency by over 30% compared to vanilla SGLang under prefill**--**decode disaggregation, and further decreases SLO violations by 28% in multi-instance deployments with vanilla data-parallel configuration. Compared to the SGLang router with load balancing, it further lowers SLO violations by 12% in multi-GPU settings.

We present a verification-based computational framework for historical drawing authentication using one-class autoencoders trained on a compact set of interpretable handcrafted features. Ten artist-specific verifiers are trained using authenticated sketches from the Metropolitan Museum of Art open-access collection, the Ashmolean Collections Catalogue, the Morgan Library and Museum, the Royal Collection Trust (UK), the Victoria and Albert Museum Collections, and an online catalogue of the Casa Buonarroti collection and evaluated under a biometric-style protocol with genuine and impostor trials. Feature vectors comprise Fourier-domain energy, Shannon entropy, global contrast, GLCM-based homogeneity, and a box-counting estimate of fractal complexity. Across 900 verification decisions (90 genuine and 810 impostor trials), the pooled system achieves a True Acceptance Rate of 83.3% with a False Acceptance Rate of 9.5% at the chosen operating point. Performance varies substantially by artist, with near-zero false acceptance for some verifiers and elevated confusability for others. A pairwise attribution of false accepts indicates structured error pathways consistent with stylistic proximity and shared drawing conventions, whilst also motivating tighter control of digitisation artefacts and threshold calibration.

We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a topology-enhanced spatio-temporal feature fusion anomaly detection method, TE-MSTAD. First, building upon the RWKV model with linear attention mechanisms, a Cross-modal Feature Extraction (CFE) module is introduced to fully extract spatial correlation features among multiple nodes while reducing computational resource consumption. Second, a strategy is designed to construct an adjacency matrix by jointly learning spatial correlation from time-frequency domain features. Different graph neural networks are integrated to enhance spatial correlation feature extraction, thereby fully capturing spatial relationships among multiple nodes. Finally, a dual-branch network TE-MSTAD is designed for time-frequency domain feature fusion, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the time or frequency domain to improve WSN anomaly detection performance.

However, traditional approaches that rely on manual scanning or fixed camera setups remain a major bottleneck in this process. In this work, we propose an active 3D reconstruction framework for horticultural environments using a mobile manipulator. The proposed system integrates the classical Octomap representation with 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable accurate and efficient target-aware mapping. While a low-resolution Octomap provides probabilistic occupancy information for informative viewpoint selection and collision-free planning, 3D Gaussian Splatting leverages geometric, photometric, and semantic information to optimize a set of 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. We further introduce simple yet effective strategies to enhance robustness against segmentation noise and reduce memory consumption. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms purely occupancy-based approaches in both runtime efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, enabling precise fruit counting and volume estimation. Compared to a 0.01m-resolution Octomap, our approach achieves an improvement of 6.6% in fruit-level F1 score under noise-free conditions, and up to 28.6% under segmentation noise.

Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods.

We show that the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by the number of chains, even with only two prescribed processing times and two distinct time-window lengths. This hardness remains even for distinct processing times and time windows under prec-consistent time windows.

However, existing multimodal inference systems typically employ monolithic architectures that tightly couple the Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages on homogeneous hardware, neglecting the heterogeneous computational characteristics of each stage. This design leads to inefficient resource utilization and limited system throughput. To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration. Leveraging the Ascend interconnect topology, EPD-Serve introduces asynchronous feature prefetching between Encode and Prefill stages and a hierarchical grouped KV cache transmission mechanism between Prefill and Decode stages to improve cross-node communication efficiency. In addition, EPD-Serve incorporates multi-route scheduling, instance-level load balancing, and multi-stage hardware co-location with spatial multiplexing to better support diverse multimodal workloads. Comprehensive experiments on multimodal understanding models demonstrate that, under high-concurrency scenarios, EPD-Serve improves end-to-end throughput by 57.37-69.48% compared to PD-disaggregated deployment, while satisfying strict SLO constraints, including TTFT below 2000 ms and TPOT below 50 ms.

We observe that the 28-layer Transformer architecture of FreeFlow can be characterized as an Euler discretization scheme for an ODE along the depth axis, where the layer index serves as the discrete time step. Therefore, we distill the number of layers of the FreeFlow model, following the same derivation logic as FreeFlow, and propose SLT (Single-Layer Transformer), which uses a single shared DiT block to approximate the depth-wise feature evolution of the 28-layer teacher. During training, it matches the teacher's intermediate features at several depth patches, fuses those patch-level representations, and simultaneously aligns the teacher's final velocity prediction. Through distillation training, we compress the 28 independent Transformer Blocks of the teacher model DiT-XL/2 into a single Transformer Block, reducing the parameter count from 675M to 4.3M. Furthermore, leveraging its minimal parameters and rapid sampling speed, SLT can screen more candidate points in the noise space within the same timeframe, thereby selecting higher-quality initial points for the teacher model FreeFlow and ultimately enhancing the quality of generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that within a time budget comparable to two random samplings of the teacher model, our method performs over 100 noise screenings and produces a high-quality sample through the teacher model using the selected points. Quality fluctuations caused by low-quality initial noise under a limited number of FreeFlow sampling calls are effectively avoided, substantially improving the stability and average generation quality of one-step generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SLT\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u84b8\u998fFreeFlow\u768428\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230FreeFlow\u768428\u5c42Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3aODE\u7684\u6b27\u62c9\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u51cf\u5c11\u5c42\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLT\uff08Single-Layer Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eabDiT\u5757\u8fd1\u4f3c28\u5c42\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u6559\u5e08\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u7ec8\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u4ece675M\u538b\u7f29\u81f34.3M\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u53ef\u7b5b\u9009100+\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SLT\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0628\u5c42Transformer\u5757\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\uff0cSLT\u80fd\u7b5b\u9009\u66f4\u591a\u566a\u58f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5019\u9009\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578bFreeFlow\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment.

Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints.

Additionally, online buyers rarely see undercarriage photos. We present an end-to-end pipeline that utilizes a three-camera rig to capture videos of the undercarriage as the vehicle drives over it, and produces an interactive 3D model of the undercarriage. The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines. These point clouds seed the Gaussian splatting process to generate photorealistic undercarriage models that render in real-time.

Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%.

The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CA-MCP\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8c03\u7528\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\uff08SCS\uff09\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684MCP\uff08CA-MCP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5185\u5b58\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u4e3b\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728TravelPlanner\u548cREALM-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCA-MCP\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfMCP\u3002", "conclusion": "CA-MCP\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b58\u50a8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86LLM\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5931\u8d25\u9891\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing strategies either sacrifice long-term context via truncation or compromise spatial structure through token pruning. In this paper, we propose Coordinate Compression Policy Optimization (CCPO), an efficient policy optimization framework that couples visual compression with policy optimization for multi-turn GUI agents. CCPO introduces Coordinate-Aware Spatial Compression (CASC), which aggregates coordinates from multiple rollouts to capture target-relevant regions and progressively narrow historical attention around key visual areas.

We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines. Under Controller Area Network (CAN) injection and LiDAR spoofing attacks, it improves Success Rate (SR) to 0.68 and 0.80, lowers the Disengagement Rate under Attack (DRA) to 0.37 and 0.03, and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0.34 and 0.11.

This tutorial offers a perspective on controlling metasurfaces by treating them as components of a larger networked system. Towards this end, we first review the physical principles of metasurfaces and their various applications, followed by an exploration of manufacturing approaches for creating these structures. Then, aligning with standard network layer concepts, we describe the modeling of metasurfaces as wave routers, enabling us to describe systems of metasurfaces using graph theory. This approach enables the development of a performance objective framework for optimizing these systems, while classes of heuristic and path-finding-driven algorithms are discussed as practical solvers. The paper also examines the integration of metasurfaces with communication systems, by presenting their overall workflow, discussing its relation to ongoing standardization efforts, as well as defining a context for their integration to network simulators, using Omnet++ as a driving example.

Moore", "Easop Lee", "Boyuan Chen"], "title": "Learning Legged MPC with Smooth Neural Surrogates", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning and model predictive control (MPC) can play complementary roles in legged robotics. However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u817f\u90e8MPC\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u975e\u7269\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u6ed1\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u975e\u7269\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5c3e\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5339\u914d\u817f\u90e8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u6ed1\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e10-50%\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u795e\u7ecf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\uff08\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece0/5\u63d0\u5347\u81f35/5\uff09\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e2-50\u500d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e73\u6ed1\u795e\u7ecf\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u817f\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\u5230\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Objective: This paper aims to consolidate existing research on technical lag, clarify definitions, explore its detection and quantification methods, examine underlying causes and consequences, review current management practices, and lay out a vision as an indicator of passively accumulated technical debt. Method: We conducted a Rapid Review with snowballing to select the appropriate peer-reviewed studies. We leveraged the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Springer as our primary source databases. Results: Technical lag accumulates passively, often unnoticed due to inadequate detection metrics and tools. It negatively impacts software quality through outdated dependencies, obsolete APIs, unsupported platforms, and aging infrastructure. Strategies to manage technical lag primarily involve automated dependency updates, continuous integration processes, and regular auditing. Conclusions: Enhancing and extending the current standardized metrics, detection methods, and empirical studies to use technical lag as an indication of accumulated latent debt can greatly improve the process of maintaining large codebases that are heavily dependent on external packages. We have identified the research gaps and outlined a future vision for researchers and practitioners to explore.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u7efc\u8ff0\u6574\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6ede\u540e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6280\u672f\u6ede\u540e\uff08technical lag\uff09\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u65f6\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u539f\u56e0\u4e0e\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u5f53\u524d\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u79ef\u7d2f\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u51fa\u613f\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08Rapid Review\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u6eda\u96ea\u7403\u6cd5\u7b5b\u9009\u5408\u9002\u7684\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5305\u62ecACM Digital Library\u3001IEEE Xplore\u3001Scopus\u548cSpringer\u3002", "result": "\u6280\u672f\u6ede\u540e\u88ab\u52a8\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u800c\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u5e9f\u5f03\u7684API\u3001\u4e0d\u53d7\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u8001\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u6ede\u540e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u503a\u52a1\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u6307\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u6539\u5584\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5305\u7684\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u52fe\u52d2\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u613f\u666f\u3002"}}

Various generalizations of this problem have been applied in numerous engineering domains. However, practical applications are often hindered by the computational challenges associated with deriving numerical results for moments and distributions. In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process. Their implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that follows from the Markov models framework, and their time complexity is analyzed accordingly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u60e0\u5238\u6536\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u60e0\u5238\u6536\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e38\u53d7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u963b\u788d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u77e9\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u540c\u503c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u60e0\u5238\u6536\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\uff08CCP\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u671f\u671b\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u96be\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff08MPG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u548c\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff08IMPG\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u591a\u89d2\u8272\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u548cDAPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08CPT\u3001SFT\u3001GRPO\uff09\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86HSM3K-CN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper suggests *persistent, partial reachability is fundamental to the Internet* and an underexplored problem. We first *derive a conceptual definition of the Internet core* based on connectivity, not authority. We identify *peninsulas*: persistent, partial connectivity; and *islands*: when computers are partitioned from the Internet core. Second, we develop algorithms to observe each across the Internet, and apply them to two existing measurement systems: Trinocular, where 6 locations observe 5M networks frequently, and RIPE Atlas, where 13k locations scan the DNS roots frequently. Cross-validation shows our findings are stable over *three years of data*, and consistent with as few as 3 geographically-distributed observers. We validate peninsulas and islands against CAIDA Ark, showing good recall (0.94) and bounding precision between 0.42 and 0.82. Finally, our work has broad practical impact: we show that *peninsulas are more common than Internet outages*. Factoring out peninsulas and islands as noise can *improve existing measurement systems*; their ``noise'' is $5\\times$ to $9.7\\times$ larger than the operational events in RIPE's DNSmon. We show that most peninsula events are routing transients (45\\%), but most peninsula-time (90\\%) is due to a few (7\\%) long-lived events.

Shergadwala"], "title": "The Stability Trap: Evaluating the Reliability of LLM-Based Instruction Adherence Auditing", "comment": null, "summary": "The enterprise governance of Generative AI (GenAI) in regulated sectors, such as Human Resources (HR), demands scalable yet reproducible auditing mechanisms. While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale.

As a combinatorial optimization model for channel assignment, the radio labeling is recognized as an NP-hard problem. Therefore, converting the spectrum assignment problem into the radio labeling of graphs and studying the radio labeling of specific graph classes is of great significance. For $G$, a radio labeling $\\varphi: V(G) \\to \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is required to satisfy $|\\varphi(u) - \\varphi(v)| \\geq \\text{diam}(G) + 1 -d_G(u, v)$, where ${diam(G)}$ and $d_G(u, v)$ are diameter and distance between $u$ and $v$. For a radio labeling $\\varphi$, its $\\text{span}$ is defined as the largest integer assigned by $\\varphi$ to the vertices of $G$; the radio labeling specifically denotes the labeling with the minimal span among possible radio labeling. The strong product is a crucial tool for constructing regular networks, and studying its radio labeling is necessary for the design of optimal channel assignment in wireless networks.

Existing benchmarks mainly rely on outcome-oriented accuracy, lacking the capability to assess whether models can accurately leverage fine-grained visual cues for multi-step reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose ViEBench, a process-verifiable benchmark designed to evaluate faithful visual reasoning. Comprising 200 multi-scenario high-resolution images with expert-annotated visual evidence, ViEBench uniquely categorizes tasks by difficulty into perception and reasoning dimensions, where reasoning tasks require utilizing localized visual details with prior knowledge. To establish comprehensive evaluation criteria, we introduce a dual-axis matrix that provides fine-grained metrics through four diagnostic quadrants, enabling transparent diagnosis of model behavior across varying task complexities. Our experiments yield several interesting observations: (1) VLMs can sometimes produce correct final answers despite grounding on irrelevant regions, and (2) they may successfully locate the correct evidence but still fail to utilize it to reach accurate conclusions.

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faCNN-QMIX\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347CAV\u7f16\u961f\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "CAV\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5e03\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u7f16\u961f\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u53c2\u4e0e\u7387\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528QMIX\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN-QMIX\uff09\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u66f4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f66\u9053\u53d8\u66f4\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\uff08CNN-QMIX\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CAV\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7f16\u961f\u7387\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe26.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff08LHDPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u4fdd\u62a46G\u8f66\u8f7d\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2dAVs\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u8f66\u8f7d\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u548c\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u670d\u52a1\u8bf7\u6c42\u548c\u865a\u62df\u4e2dAI\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u63a8\u65adAV\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8de8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u865a\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5AI\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u2014\u2014\u8de8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6269\u6563\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08LHDPPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8de8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8de8\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e866G\u8f66\u8f7d\u5143\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

While the current trend is to use learning-based approaches to replace traditional geometry-based methods, existing end-to-end learning-based policies often struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and lack a comprehensive understanding of physical world dynamics. Integrating world models-which predict future observations conditioned on given actions-with iterative optimization planning offers a promising solution due to their capacity for imagination and flexibility. However, current navigation world models, typically built on pure transformer architectures, often rely on multi-step diffusion processes and autoregressive frame-by-frame generation. These mechanisms result in prohibitive computational latency, rendering real-time deployment impossible. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight navigation world model that adopts a one-step generation paradigm and a 3D U-Net backbone equipped with efficient spatial-temporal attention. This design drastically reduces inference latency, enabling high-frequency control while achieving superior predictive performance. We also integrate this model into an optimization-based planning framework utilizing anchor-based initialization to handle multi-modal goal navigation tasks.

While these tools may increase student productivity, they also make it more difficult for instructors to assess students' learning and effort. In this quasi-longitudinal study, we analyze five years of student source code submissions in a graduate-level cloud computing course, focusing on an assignment that remained unchanged and examining students' behavior during the period spanning five semesters before the release of ChatGPT and five semesters after.\n  Student coding behavior has changed significantly since Fall 2022. The length of their final submissions increased. Between consecutive submissions, average edit distances increased while average score improvement decreased, suggesting that both student productivity and learning have decreased after ChatGPT's release. Additionally, there are statistically significant correlations between these behavioral changes and their overall performance. Although we cannot definitively attribute them to LLM misuse, they are consistent with our hypothesis that some students are over-reliant on LLMs, which is negatively affecting their learning outcomes.

It has been used for various tasks such as retrieving similar items in high-dimensional images or text data. In retrieval applications, however, the Wasserstein distance is calculated repeatedly, and its cubic time complexity with respect to input size renders it unsuitable for large-scale datasets. Recently, tree-based approximation methods have been proposed to address this bottleneck. For example, the Flowtree algorithm computes transport on a quadtree and evaluates cost using the ground metric, and clustering-tree approaches have been reported to achieve high accuracy. However, these existing trees often incur significant construction time for preprocessing, and crucially, standard quadtrees cannot grow deep enough in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in poor approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose kd-Flowtree, a kd-tree-based Wasserstein distance approximation method that uses a kd-tree for data embedding. Since kd-trees can grow sufficiently deep and adaptively even in high-dimensional cases, kd-Flowtree is capable of maintaining good approximation accuracy for such cases. In addition, kd-trees can be constructed quickly than quadtrees, which contributes to reducing the computation time required for nearest neighbor search, including preprocessing. We provide a probabilistic upper bound on the nearest-neighbor search accuracy of kd-Flowtree, and show that this bound is independent of the dataset size. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrated that kd-Flowtree outperformed the existing Wasserstein distance approximation methods for retrieval tasks with real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "kd-Flowtree \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e kd \u6811\u7684 Wasserstein \u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa kd-Flowtree \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528 kd \u6811\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6807\u51c6\u56db\u53c9\u6811\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ckd-Flowtree \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684 Wasserstein \u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "kd-Flowtree \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e kd \u6811\u7684 Wasserstein \u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, traditional human-driven discovery of emerging issues is too slow, which leads to delayed updates of annotation policies and poses a major challenge for effective content governance. In this work, we propose an automatic issue discovery method based on multimodal LLM agents. Our approach automatically recalls short videos containing potential new issues and applies a two-stage clustering strategy to group them, with each cluster corresponding to a newly discovered issue. The agent then generates updated annotation policies from these clusters, thereby extending coverage to these emerging issues. Our agent has been deployed in the real system. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that this agent-based method significantly improves the effectiveness of emerging-issue discovery (with an F1 score improvement of over 20%) and enhances the performance of subsequent issue governance (reducing the view count of problematic videos by approximately 15%). More importantly, compared to manual issue discovery, it greatly reduces time costs and substantially accelerates the iteration of annotation policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5185\u5bb9\u6cbb\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff08\u8d85\u8fc720%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u89c2\u770b\u91cf\uff08\u7ea615%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u6cbb\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

We present POLARIS (Policy-Aware LLM Agentic Reasoning for Integrated Systems), a governed orchestration framework that treats automation as typed plan synthesis and validated execution over LLM agents. A planner proposes structurally diverse, type checked directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a rubric guided reasoning module selects a single compliant plan, and execution is guarded by validator gated checks, a bounded repair loop, and compiled policy guardrails that block or route side effects before they occur. Applied to document centric finance tasks, POLARIS produces decision grade artifacts and full execution traces while reducing human intervention. Empirically, POLARIS achieves a micro F1 of 0.81 on the SROIE dataset and, on a controlled synthetic suite, achieves 0.95 to 1.00 precision for anomaly routing with preserved audit trails. These evaluations constitute an initial benchmark for governed Agentic AI. POLARIS provides a methodological and benchmark reference for policy-aligned Agentic AI.

While Transformer-based models are effective for sequence modeling, their quadratic complexity limits scalability in Near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) analytics. This paper investigates a post-Transformer design paradigm for efficient radio telemetry forecasting. We propose a quantum-inspired many-body state-space tensor network that replaces self-attention with stable structured state-space dynamics kernels, enabling linear-time sequence modeling. Tensor-network factorizations in the form of Tensor Train (TT) / Matrix Product State (MPS) representations are employed to reduce parameterization and data movement in both input projections and prediction heads, while lightweight channel gating and mixing layers capture non-stationary cross-Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dependencies. The proposed model is instantiated as an agentic perceive-predict xApp and evaluated on a bespoke O-RAN KPI time-series dataset comprising 59,441 sliding windows across 13 KPIs, using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) forecasting as a representative use case. Our proposed Linear Quantum-Inspired State-Space (LiQSS) model is 10.8x-15.8x smaller and approximately 1.4x faster than prior structured state-space baselines.

While collaborative localization across multi-session mapping enhances efficiency, traditional structure-based methods struggle with high maintenance costs and fail in feature-less environments or under significant viewpoint changes typical of crowd-sourced data. To address this, we propose OPENNAVMAP, a lightweight, structure-free topometric system leveraging 3D geometric foundation models for on-demand reconstruction. Our method unifies dynamic programming-based sequence matching, geometric verification, and confidence-calibrated optimization to robust, coarse-to-fine submap alignment without requiring pre-built 3D models. Evaluations on the Map-Free benchmark demonstrate superior accuracy over structure-from-motion and regression baselines, achieving an average translation error of 0.62m. Furthermore, the system maintains global consistency across 15km of multi-session data with an absolute trajectory error below 3m for map merging. Finally, we validate practical utility through 12 successful autonomous image-goal navigation tasks on simulated and physical robots.

We present OmniLink, a new methodology for validating concurrent implementations against high-level specifications in TLA+. Unlike prior TLA+ based approaches which use a technique called trace validation, OmniLink treats system events as black boxes with a timebox in which they occurred and a meaning in TLA+, solving for a logical total order of actions. Unlike prior approaches based on linearizability checking, which already solves for total orders of actions with timeboxes, OmniLink uses a flexible specification language, and offers a different linearizability checking method based on off-the-shelf model checking. OmniLink offers different features compared existing linearizability checking tools, and we show that it outperforms the state of the art on large scale validation tasks.\n  Our evaluation validates WiredTiger, a state-of-the-art industrial database storage layer, as well as Balanced Augmented Tree (BAT), a state-of-the art lock-free data structure from the research community, and ConcurrentQueue, a popular lock-free queue featuring aggressive performance optimizations. We use OmniLink to improve WiredTiger's existing TLA+ model, as well as develop new TLA+ models that closely match the behavior of the modeled systems, including non-linearizable behaviors.

Camera-ready version for Greenvolve 2026 co-located at IEEE SANER 2026", "summary": "Retrieving data from large-scale source code archives is vital for AI training, neural-based software analysis, and information retrieval, to cite a few. This paper studies and experiments with the design of a compressed key-value store for the indexing of large-scale source code datasets, evaluating its trade-off among three primary computational resources: (compressed) space occupancy, time, and energy efficiency. Extensive experiments on a national high-performance computing infrastructure demonstrate that different compression configurations yield distinct trade-offs, with high compression ratios and order-of-magnitude gains in retrieval throughput and energy efficiency. We also study data parallelism and show that, while it significantly improves speed, scaling energy efficiency is more difficult, reflecting the known non-energy-proportionality of modern hardware and challenging the assumption of a direct time-energy correlation. This work streamlines automation in energy-aware configuration tuning and standardized green benchmarking deployable in CI/CD pipelines, thus empowering system architects with a spectrum of Pareto-optimal energy-compression-throughput trade-offs and actionable guidelines for building sustainable, efficient storage backends for massive open-source code archival.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6863\u6848\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u5bf9AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u952e\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u7b49\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the resulting exponential growth in computation workload is placing significant strain on data centers, while edge devices remain largely underutilized, leading to imbalanced workloads and resource inefficiency across the network. Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler. These components collaboratively enhance drafting efficiency and optimize verification request scheduling on the server. Extensive numerical results show that WISP improves system capacity by up to 2.1x and 4.1x, and increases system goodput by up to 1.94x and 3.7x, compared to centralized serving and SLED, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WISP\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8bf7\u6c42\u4ece\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5411\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0fGPU\u96c6\u7fa4\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u538b\u529b\u589e\u5927\u800c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WISP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6279\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "WISP\u76f8\u6bd4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u548cSLED\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.1\u500d\u548c4.1\u500d\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe1.94\u500d\u548c3.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "WISP\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6279\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u63a8\u6d4bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

Specifically, we inpaint faces by a diffusion-based generative model guided by high-level attribute recognition and motion-aware expression transfer. We then animate deidentified faces by video-driven animation, which accepts the de-identified face and the original video as input.

Automated PICOS compliance and study design classification from titles and abstracts were performed using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory baseline and a transformer-based multi-task classifier fine-tuned from PubMedBERT. Full-text synthesis employed retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid vector and graph retrieval, while BERTopic was used to identify thematic structure, redundancy, and evidence gaps. The transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy for study design classification with strong agreement against expert annotations, while the Bi-LSTM achieved 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance detection. Retrieval-augmented generation outperformed non-retrieval generation for queries requiring structured constraints, cross-study integration, and graph-based reasoning, whereas non-retrieval approaches remained competitive for high-level summaries. Topic modeling revealed substantial thematic redundancy and identified underexplored research areas.

To this end, we design a secure routing architecture integrating software-defined networking (SDN) for centralized control and blockchain for tamper-proof trust management. In particular, a novel security degree metric is introduced to quantify the UAV trustworthiness. Based on this architecture, we propose a beam search-proximal policy optimization (BSPPO) algorithm, where beam search (BS) pre-screens the high-security candidate paths, and proximal policy optimization (PPO) performs hop-by-hop routing decisions to support dynamic rerouting upon attack detections. Finally, extensive simulations under varying attack densities, packet sizes, and rerouting events demonstrate that BSPPO outperforms PPO, BS-Q learning, and BS-actor critic in terms of delay, energy consumption, and transmission success rate, showing the outstanding robustness and adaptability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBSPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDN\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u96c6\u6210SDN\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faBSPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u653b\u51fb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0cBSPPO\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ePPO\u3001BS-Q\u5b66\u4e60\u548cBS-actor critic\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408SDN\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caBSPPO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation.

It measures reasoning correctness about program state spaces, control flow, coverage constraints, and edge cases, with ground truth defined via formal modeling and region decomposition.\n  Comparing LLM-only reasoning against LLMs augmented with CodeLogician, formal augmentation yields substantial improvements, closing a 41-47 percentage point gap in reasoning accuracy.

While the ubiquity and low cost of commodity Wi-Fi make it an ideal platform for wide-scale sensing, it is the continuous evolution of Wi-Fi standards-towards higher frequency bands, wider bandwidths, and larger antenna arrays-that fundamentally unlocks the physical resources required for high-performance ISAC. To structure this rapidly expanding field, numerous surveys have appeared. However, prevailing literature predominantly adopts a top-down perspective, emphasizing upper-layer applications or deep learning models while treating the physical layer as an opaque abstraction. Consequently, these works often fail to touch the bottom layer of signal formation and lack technical guidance on overcoming the physical barriers that constrain sensing performance. To bridge this gap, this tutorial takes a bottom-up approach, systematically analyzing the sensing gains brought by Wi-Fi advancements through the lens of physical-layer diversity. We organize the framework around four orthogonal dimensions: i) Temporal Diversity addresses synchronization gaps to enable absolute ranging; ii) Frequency Diversity expands the effective bandwidth to sharpen range resolution; iii) Link Diversity leverages distributed topologies and digital feedback to achieve ubiquitous observability; and iv) Spatial Diversity utilizes multi-antenna arrays to combine passive angular discrimination with active directional control.

VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harmonica\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eHarmonE\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8303\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MAPE-K\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f9d\u8d56MLOps\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MLS\uff09\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1MLOps\u7b80\u5316\u4e86ML\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5f71\u54cdMLS\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "Harmonica\u57fa\u4e8eHarmonE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MAPE-K\u5faa\u73af\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6218\u672f\u6267\u884c\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u5b83\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9608\u503c\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u67b6\u6784\u6218\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0cHarmonica\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Harmonica\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4f9d\u8d56MLOps\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002"}}

As an immediate consequence, we obtain Berry-Esseen type inequalities for hypergraph $q$-colorings under such conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic normality for the size of any color class in a uniformly random coloring. Our framework also extends to the study of \"Fisher zeros\", leading to deterministic algorithms for approximating the partition function in the zero-free region.\n  Our approach is based on extending the recent work of [Liu, Wang, Yin, Yu, STOC 2025] to general constraint satisfaction problems (CSP).

A hybrid batch combines prefill and decode tokens of different requests in the same batch to improve resource utilization and throughput at the cost of increased latency per token. In contrast, disaggregated serving decouples compute-bound prefill and bandwidth-bound decode phases to optimize for service level objectives (SLOs) at the cost of resource under-utilization and KV-cache transfer overheads. To address the limitations of these techniques, we propose RAPID-Serve: a technique to concurrently execute prefill and decode on the same GPU(s) to meet latency SLOs while maintaining high throughput and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Resource Management for runtime compute resource allocation, optionally leveraging CU masking (a fine-grained Compute Unit partitioning feature on AMD Instinct\\textsuperscript{TM} GPUs). RAPID-Serve provides up to 4.1x (average 1.7x) unconstrained throughput improvement and 32x and higher (average 4.9x) throughput improvement under SLO constraints, showing it as an effective strategy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAPID-Serve \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684 LLM \u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u53d1\u6267\u884c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u6279\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u670d\u52a1\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa RAPID-Serve \u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u540c\u4e00 GPU \u4e0a\u5e76\u53d1\u6267\u884c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u548c CU \u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "RAPID-Serve \u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe4.1\u500d\uff08\u5e73\u57471.7\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u5728 SLO \u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe32\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff08\u5e73\u57474.9\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RAPID-Serve \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe4.1\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

During off-peak hours, large parts of the networks remain underutilized, presenting significant potential for energy savings. Existing Green Traffic Engineering approaches attempt to leverage this potential by switching off those parts of the networks that are not required for the routing of specific traffic matrices. When traffic changes, the approaches need to adapt rapidly, which is hard to achieve given the complexity of the problem. We take a fundamentally different approach: instead of considering a specific traffic matrix, we rely on a traffic-oblivious routing scheme. We discuss the NP-hard problem of activating as few connections as possible while still guaranteeing that any down-scaled traffic matrix $\\varrho\\cdot T$ can be routed, where $\\varrho \\in (0,1)$ and $T$ is any traffic matrix routable in the original network.

We present VR2VR, a co-located dual VR-headset platform for HRI research in which a participant and a hidden operator share the same physical space while experiencing different virtual embodiments. The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body gestures, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked motion and face signals. Because the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also physically touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch aligned with the robot's hands; finger and hand motion are mapped to the robot using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb teleoperation, our VR2VR system supports experimental control by retargeting or selectively enabling nonverbal channels (e.g., head only vs. head+eyes vs. head+eyes+facial expressions) while keeping physical interaction constant.

In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results.

The celebrated Vizing's theorem [Viz64] states that every simple graph $G = (V,E)$ can be properly $(\u0394+1)$-edge-colored. In a seminal paper, Karloff and Shmoys [KS87] devised a parallel algorithm with time $O\\left(\u0394^5\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\left(\\log^3 n+\u0394^2\\right)\\right)$ and $O(m\\cdot\u0394)$ processors. This result was improved by Liang et al.

We devise a faster parallel algorithm for this fundamental problem. Specifically, our algorithm uses $O\\left(\u0394^4\\cdot \\log^4 n\\right)$ time and $O(m\\cdot \u0394)$ processors. Another variant of our algorithm requires $O\\left(\u0394^{4+o(1)}\\cdot\\log^2 n\\right)$ time, and $O\\left(m\\cdot\u0394\\cdot\\log n\\cdot\\log^\u03b4\u0394\\right)$ processors, for an arbitrarily small $\u03b4>0$. We also devise a few other tradeoffs between the time and the number of processors, and devise an improved algorithm for graphs with small arboricity.

The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a \\texttt{gcc} compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75\\%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87\\% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs with compiler access show significant improvements in generating runnable code, reducing errors, and sometimes outperforming larger models, highlighting the importance of tool integration for efficiency.", "motivation": "To study how access to software development tools (e.g., a compiler) improves LLMs' ability to generate runnable programs by shifting from passive generation to active, iterative development based on compiler feedback.", "method": "A computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset with 699 C programming tasks, evaluating 16 language models of varying sizes (135M to 70B) integrated with a GCC compiler.", "result": "Access to a compiler improved compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage points, reduced syntax errors by 75%, and undefined reference errors by 87%.

The game is played on a graph having a subset of vertices labeled as exits and the goal of one of the two players, called the fugitive, is to reach one of these exit vertices. The second player, i.e. the fugitive adversary, is called the Nemesis. Her goal is to trap the fugitive in a connected component which does not contain any exit. At each round of the game, the fugitive moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. Then the Nemesis deletes one edge anywhere in the graph. The game ends when either the fugitive reached an exit or when he is in a connected component that does not contain any exit. In trees and graphs of maximum degree bounded by 3, Nemesis can be solved in linear time. We also show that a variant of the game called Blizzard where only edges adjacent to the position of the fugitive can be deleted also admits a linear time solution. For arbitrary graphs, we show that Nemesis is PSPACE-complete, and that it is NP-hard on planar multigraphs. We extend our results to the related Cat Herding problem, proving its PSPACE-completeness.

As scientific simulations attempt to exploit exascale systems, there has been a growing demand for distributed FFT algorithms that can effectively utilize modern heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Conventional FFT algorithms commonly encounter performance bottlenecks, especially when run on heterogeneous platforms. Most distributed FFT approaches rely on static task distribution and require synchronization barriers, limiting scalability and impacting overall resource utilization. In this paper we present DaggerFFT, a distributed FFT framework, developed in Julia, that treats highly parallel FFT computations as a dynamically scheduled task graph. Each FFT stage operates on a separately defined distributed array. FFT operations are expressed as DTasks operating on pencil or slab partitioned DArrays. Each FFT stage owns its own DArray, and the runtime assigns DTasks across devices using Dagger's dynamic scheduler that uses work stealing. We demonstrate how DaggerFFT's dynamic scheduler can outperform state-of-the-art distributed FFT libraries on both CPU and GPU backends, achieving up to a 2.6x speedup on CPU clusters and up to a 1.35x speedup on GPU clusters.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer quantitative tools for OA assessment but depend on large, well-annotated image datasets, mainly X-ray scans, that are often difficult to obtain because of privacy, governance and resourcing constraints. In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Using PSSF, we create a virtual cohort of 180 subjects (260 knees), each is imaged under three protocols (reference, low-dose, and geometry-shift). Medial joint regions are automatically localized, preprocessed, and processed with the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI). Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like \"0\" vs. \"2\") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images.

Our results on enterprise-style agent workflows simulated using realistic business scenarios demonstrate that AEMA provides a transparent and reproducible pathway toward responsible evaluation of LLM-based multi-agent systems.\n  Keywords Agentic AI, Multi-Agent Systems, Trustworthy AI, Verifiable Evaluation, Human Oversight", "AI": {"tldr": "AEMA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u54cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u5206\u6216\u72ed\u7a84\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AEMA\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "AEMA\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "conclusion": "AEMA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Specifically, we first construct a large-scale (~235K) video preference dataset and employ it to train a hierarchical reward model designed to capture multi-dimensional reward consistent with human preferences. We further propose a practical alignment algorithm that post-trains flow-based world models using this reward through a computationally efficient PPO-style algorithm.

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u548c\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LIBRA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u9057\u61be\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6cbb\u7597\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7ebf\u6027\u8d44\u6e90\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff08GLRB\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LIBRA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cGLRB\u548cLIBRA\u5728\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u8840\u538b\u7ba1\u7406\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u7eafLLM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9057\u61be\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86GLRB\u548cLIBRA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u521d\u59cb\u9057\u61be\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u548c\u7eafLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

By mutually sharing physical sites, radio elements, licensed spectrum and other parts of the RAN infrastructure, participating operators can significantly reduce the capital (and operational) expenditure in deploying and operating cellular networks, while accelerating coverage expansion -- thereby addressing the spectrum scarcity and infrastructure cost challenges in the 5G era and beyond. While the economic benefits of RAN sharing are well understood, the impact of such resource pooling on user-perceived performance remains underexplored, especially in real-world commercial deployments. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical measurement study of commercial 5G spectrum and RAN sharing.

By lifting measurements into a feature space where they are linear in the state, KILO-EKF enables flexible modeling of complex or poorly calibrated sensors while retaining the structure and efficiency of recursive filtering. The resulting linear-Gaussian measurement model is learned in closed form from groundtruth training data, without iterative optimization or reliance on an explicit parametric sensor model. At inference, KILO-EKF performs a standard EKF update using Jacobians obtained via the learned lifting. We validate the approach on a real-world quadrotor localization task using an IMU, ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors, and a downward-facing laser. We compare against multiple EKF baselines with varying levels of sensor calibration. KILO-EKF achieves better accuracy and consistency compared to data-calibrated baselines, and significantly outperforms EKFs that rely on imperfect geometric models, while maintaining real-time inference and fast training.

However, it is significantly impeded by challenges such as the coexistence of densely packed and sparsely distributed cells, complex overlapping morphologies, and severe class imbalance. Conventional deep learning models often fail to preserve fine topological details or accurately delineate boundaries under these conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, IMSAHLO (Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization), for robust and adaptive neuronal segmentation. The core of our model features Multi-Scale Dense Blocks (MSDBs) to capture features at various receptive fields, effectively handling variations in cell density, and a Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient morphological features to preserve Region of Interest (ROI) boundary details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss function synergistically combining Tversky and Focal loss to combat class imbalance, alongside a topology-aware Centerline Dice (clDice) loss and a Contour-Weighted Boundary loss to ensure topological continuity and precise separation of adjacent cells. Large-scale experiments on the public Fluorescent Neuronal Cells (FNC) dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving precision of 81.4%, macro F1 score of 82.7%, micro F1 score of 83.3%, and balanced accuracy of 99.5% on difficult dense and sparse cases.

Leveraging the global control capabilities of a geostationary (GEO)-resident software-defined networking (SDN) controller, we introduce opportunistic routing, which aims to minimize delivery delay by forwarding packets to any currently available ground gateways rather than fixed destinations. This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay. Simulation results over multiple days of orbital data demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in queue length reduction compared to classical backpressure and other well-known queueing algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u9047\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001LEO\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LEO\u536b\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u667a\u80fd\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7f51\u5173\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GEO\u9a7b\u7559\u7684SDN\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u673a\u9047\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u5929\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u9047\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684LEO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u80cc\u538b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u77e5\u540d\u6392\u961f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on opaque visual embeddings -- high-dimensional feature vectors extracted from images -- the proposed method uses human-readable language to represent observations. Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load. Ongoing work explores refined similarity metrics, semantic navigation, and the extension of language-based perception to environmental elements. This work prioritizes decentralized perception and communication, while active navigation remains an open direction for future study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u4eba\u5458\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee3\u66ff\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee3\u66ff\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u96c6\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u7684\u4eba\u5458\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u822a\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

As a result, it is unclear whether LLMs can reliably generate executable code tailored to a user's specific environment. We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/icdcs63083.2025.00088", "summary": "Real-world graphs are dynamic, with frequent updates to their structure and features due to evolving vertex and edge properties. These continual changes pose significant challenges for efficient inference in graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing vertex-wise and layer-wise inference approaches are ill-suited for dynamic graphs, as they incur redundant computations, large neighborhood traversals, and high communication costs, especially in distributed settings. Additionally, while sampling-based approaches can be adopted to approximate final layer embeddings, these are often not preferred in critical applications due to their non-determinism. These limitations hinder low-latency inference required in real-time applications. To address this, we propose RIPPLE++, a framework for streaming GNN inference that efficiently and accurately updates embeddings in response to changes in the graph structure or features. RIPPLE++ introduces a generalized incremental programming model that captures the semantics of GNN aggregation functions and incrementally propagates updates to affected neighborhoods.

Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.\n  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability.

To address the limitations of existing approaches in handling dynamic demands and predicting users' implicit intents, in this paper we propose an edge service function chain (SFC) orchestration framework empowered by a Generative Intent Prediction Agent (GIPA). Our GIPA aims to shift the paradigm from passive execution to proactive prediction and orchestration. First, we construct a multidimensional intent space that includes functional preferences, QoS sensitivity, and resource requirements, enabling the mapping from unstructured natural language to quantifiable physical resource demands. Second, to cope with the complexity and randomness of intent sequences, we design an intent prediction model based on a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM), which reconstructs users' implicit intents from multidimensional context through a reverse denoising process. Finally, the predicted implicit intents are embedded as global prompts into the SFC orchestration model to guide the network in proactively and ahead-of-time optimizing SFC deployment strategies.

However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u88ab\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5916\u58c1\u5f15\u5165\u5c48\u66f2\u70b9\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5f2f\u66f2\u521a\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u67d4\u8f6f\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u589e\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u727a\u7272\u5176\u67d4\u8f6f\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u88ab\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5916\u58c1\u5b9a\u671f\u96c6\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u4f38\u5c55\u7684\u76f4\u5f84\u51cf\u5c0f\u73af\u5e26\uff0c\u5229\u7528Cosserat\u6746\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u521a\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u5f2f\u66f2\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73af\u5e26\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5c16\u7aef\u5f2f\u66f2\u65f6\u7684\u521a\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8691%\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4f4e\u81f325\u6beb\u7c73\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u534a\u5f84\u901a\u8fc7180\u5ea6\u5f2f\u9053\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u768435\u6beb\u7c73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u88ab\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5916\u58c1\u5f15\u5165\u5c48\u66f2\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f2f\u66f2\u521a\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u67d4\u8f6f\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7ba1\u9053\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from low repair success rates or poor understandability of the generated patches. In this study, we construct a framework in which a large language model (LLM) generates code repairs along with a natural language explanation of the applied repairs. To investigate how the contextual information included in prompts influences APR performance for quantum programs, we design four prompt configurations with different combinations of static information, dynamic information, and mutation analysis results. Mutation analysis evaluates how small changes to specific parts of a program affect its execution results and provides more detailed dynamic information than simple execution outputs such as stack traces. Our experimental results show that mutation analysis can provide valuable contextual information for LLM-based APR of quantum programs, improving repair success rates (achieving 94.4% in our experiment) and in some cases also improving the quality of generated explanations.

However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs, sensitivity to user interactions, and degraded performance when the foreground and background share similar color distributions. A key factor influencing segmentation performance is the similarity measure used for assigning edge weights in the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pixel Segment Similarity Index (PSSI), which leverages the harmonic mean of inter-channel similarities by incorporating both pixel intensity and spatial smoothness features. The harmonic mean effectively penalizes dissimilarities in any individual channel, enhancing robustness. The computational complexity of PSSI is $\\mathcal{O}(B)$, where $B$ denotes the number of histogram bins. Our segmentation framework begins with low-level segmentation using MeanShift, which effectively captures color, texture, and segment shape. Based on the resulting pixel segments, we construct a pixel-segment graph with edge weights determined by PSSI. For partitioning, we employ the Maximum Spanning Tree (MaxST), which captures strongly connected local neighborhoods beneficial for precise segmentation.

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps.

However, user mobility creates highly dynamic service demands in edge networks, and existing service scheduling agents often lack generalization capabilities for new scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Intent-Driven General Agentic AI (IGAA) framework. Leveraging a meta-learning paradigm, IGAA enables AAI to continuously learn from prior service scheduling experiences to achieve generalized scheduling capabilities. Particularly, IGAA incorporates three core mechanisms. First, we design a Network-Service-Intent matrix mapping method to allow agents to simulate novel scenarios and generate training datasets. Second, we present an easy-to-hard generalization learning scheme with two customized algorithms, namely Resource Causal Effect-aware Transfer Learning (RCETL) and Action Potential Optimality-aware Transfer Learning (APOTL). These algorithms help IGAA adapt to new scenarios. Furthermore, to prevent catastrophic forgetting during continual IGAA learning, we propose a Generative Intent Replay (GIR) mechanism that synthesizes historical service data to consolidate prior capabilities. Finally, to mitigate the effect of LLM hallucinations on scenario simulation, we incorporate a scenario evaluation and correction model to guide agents in generating rational scenarios and datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate IGAA's strong generalization and scalability. Specifically, IGAA enables rapid adaptation by transferring learned policies to analogous new ones, such as applying latency-sensitive patterns from real-time computing to optimize novel Internet of Vehicles (IoV) services.

This paper studies a variant, HPP with Probabilistic Terminals (HPP-PT), where each vertex has a probability representing the likelihood that the robot's path terminates there, and the objective is to minimize the expected path cost. HPP-PT arises in target object search, where a mobile robot must visit all candidate locations to find an object, and prior knowledge of the object's location is expressed as vertex probabilities. While routing problems have been studied for decades, few of them consider uncertainty as required in this work. The challenge lies not only in optimally ordering the vertices, as in standard HPP, but also in handling history dependency: the expected path cost depends on the order in which vertices were previously visited. This makes many existing methods inefficient or inapplicable. To address the challenge, we propose a search-based approach RPT* with solution optimality guarantees, which leverages dynamic programming in a new state space to bypass the history dependency and novel heuristics to speed up the computation. Building on RPT*, we design a Hierarchical Autonomous Target Search (HATS) system that combines RPT* with either Bayesian filtering for lifelong target search with noisy sensors, or autonomous exploration to find targets in unknown environments. Experiments in both simulation and real robot show that our approach can naturally balance between exploitation and exploration, thereby finding targets more quickly on average than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes RPT* and HATS to solve the HPP-PT problem, leveraging dynamic programming and novel heuristics to handle uncertainty and history dependency, showing superior performance in target search scenarios.", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the need to solve routing problems under uncertainty, specifically the HPP-PT variant, which is crucial for applications like target object search where prior knowledge of object locations is probabilistic.

The approach decomposes the problem into two sequential game theoretic stages. In the first stage, vehicles form stable clusters by evaluating mutual sensing complementarity and motion coherence, and each cluster elects a coordinator. In the second stage, the coordinator guides its members to selectively transmit point cloud segments from perceptually salient regions through a non cooperative potential game, enabling efficient local fusion. Global scene understanding is then achieved by exchanging compact detection messages across clusters rather than raw sensor data. We design distributed algorithms for both stages that guarantee monotonic improvement of the system wide potential function. Comprehensive experiments on the CARLA-OpenCDA-NS3 co-simulation platform show that our method reduces communication overhead while delivering higher perception accuracy and wider effective coverage compared to existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u535a\u5f08\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8f66\u8f86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u65e0\u8def\u8fb9\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u987a\u5e8f\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u8f66\u8f86\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u4e3e\u534f\u8c03\u5458\uff1b\u534f\u8c03\u5458\u5f15\u5bfc\u6210\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5408\u4f5c\u6f5c\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4f20\u8f93\u611f\u77e5\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5c40\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA-OpenCDA-NS3\u8054\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u8f86\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5408\u4f5c\u7ec4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs.

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety.

Prevailing end-to-end models tightly couple feature extraction with classification, overlooking the inherent time-frequency sparsity of CSI and leading to redundancy and poor generalization. To address this, this paper proposes a lightweight feature preprocessing module--the Variational Dual-path Attention Network (VDAN). It performs structured feature refinement through frequency-domain filtering and temporal detection. Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise.

However, prior systems struggle to integrate VLMs into practical aerial systems due to orders-of-magnitude frequency mismatch between VLM inference and real-time planning, as well as VLMs' limited 3D scene understanding. They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments further validate AirHunt's practical capability in complex and challenging environments.

This paper presents a purpose-built lightweight object detection model designed to identify young pedestrians in various environmental scenarios. To address these challenges, our approach leverages thermal imaging from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, which enhances detection reliability in conditions where traditional RGB cameras operating in the visible spectrum fail. Based on the YOLO11 architecture and customized for thermal detection, our model, termed LTV-YOLO (Lightweight Thermal Vision YOLO), is optimized for computational efficiency, accuracy and real-time performance on edge devices. By integrating separable convolutions in depth and a feature pyramid network (FPN), LTV-YOLO achieves strong performance in detecting small-scale, partially occluded, and thermally distinct VRUs while maintaining a compact architecture. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults). Although FPN and depthwise separable convolutions are standard components, their integration into a thermal-only pipeline optimized for short/occluded VRUs under adverse conditions is, to the best of our knowledge, novel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bLTV-YOLO\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7b49VRUs\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRGB\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u6613\u53d7\u4f24\u5bb3\u7684\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff08VRUs\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO11\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u5236\uff0cLTV-YOLO\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FPN\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u548c\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\u660e\u663e\u7684VRUs\u3002", "result": "LTV-YOLO\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u548c\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\u660e\u663e\u7684VRUs\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLTV-YOLO\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7b49\u6613\u53d7\u4f24\u5bb3\u7684\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff08VRUs\uff09\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Benchmarking Structural Correctness-Sustainability Trade-offs in Novel Structured Output Formats", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate structured, machine-readable outputs for downstream systems. While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0TOON\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u78b3\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u5176\u73af\u5883\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d4b\u91cf\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff08GCS_env\uff09\u3002", "result": "TOON\u683c\u5f0f\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5982TOON\uff09\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u6ce8\u91cd\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, designing interoperable control schemes that jointly exploit long-term traffic awareness and near-real-time radio resource optimization remains a challenging problem, particularly under dense multi-cell interference and heterogeneous service demands. This paper proposes an interoperable rApp/xApp-driven dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) framework for O-RAN, based on a graph-theoretic formulation of physical resource block (PRB) assignment. The proposed architecture leverages a non-real-time radio intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC) rApp to predict aggregated traffic evolution and generate high-level spectrum policies at the minutes timescale, while a near-real-time RIC (Near-RT RIC) xApp constructs a user-centric conflict graph and performs fairness-aware PRB allocation at sub-second timescales. To mitigate persistent user starvation, a conflict-aware modified proportional fair (MPF) scheduling mechanism is applied, enabling controlled interference-free PRB time-sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the PRB assignment success rate (above 90%) and service-share fairness (above 85%) across different channel configurations and user demands, while maintaining architectural separation and rApp/xApp interoperability in accordance with O-RAN principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8bba\u7684O-RAN\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5crApp/xApp\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6RIC\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PRB\u5206\u914d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u957f\u671f\u6d41\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8bba\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u5757\uff08PRB\uff09\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5b9e\u65f6RIC rApp\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6RIC xApp\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u7684PRB\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PRB\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PRB\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff09\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u8d85\u8fc785%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86O-RAN\u539f\u5219\u4e0b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u548crApp/xApp\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent research has attempted to leverage historical bugs to design new mutation operators or fine-tune models to increase program diversity for compiler fuzzing.We observe, however, that bugs manifest primarily based on the semantics of input programs rather than their syntax. Unfortunately, current approaches, whether relying on syntactic mutation or general Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, struggle to preserve the specific semantics found in the logic of bug-triggering programs. Consequently, these critical semantic triggers are often lost, resulting in a limitation of the diversity of generated programs.\n  To explicitly reuse such semantics, we propose FeatureFuzz, a compiler fuzzer that combines features to generate programs. We define a feature as a decoupled primitive that encapsulates a natural language description of a bug-prone invariant, such as an out-of-bounds array access, alongside a concrete code witness of its realization. FeatureFuzz operates via a three-stage workflow: it first extracts features from historical bug reports, synthesizes coherent groups of features, and finally instantiates these groups into valid programs for compiler fuzzing.\n  We evaluated FeatureFuzz on GCC and LLVM. Over 24-hour campaigns, FeatureFuzz uncovered 167 unique crashes, which is 2.78x more than the second-best fuzzer. Furthermore, through a 72-hour fuzzing campaign, FeatureFuzz identified 106 bugs in GCC and LLVM, 76 of which have already been confirmed by compiler developers, validating the approach's ability to stress-test modern compilers effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "FeatureFuzz\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u6216\u901a\u7528LLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u89e6\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "FeatureFuzz\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u9519\u8bef\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728GCC\u548cLLVM\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cFeatureFuzz\u572824\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u53d1\u73b0167\u6b21\u72ec\u7279\u5d29\u6e83\uff08\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a2.78\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572872\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u786e\u8ba4\u4e8676\u4e2a\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "FeatureFuzz\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Collaborative perception improves accuracy by mitigating the sensing limitations of individual vehicles, such as limited perception range and occlusion-induced blind spots. However, collaborative perception often suffers from high communication overhead due to redundant data transmission, as well as increasing computation latency caused by excessive load with growing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) participation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel local-to-global collaborative perception framework (LGCP) to achieve collaboration in a communication- and computation-efficient manner. The road of interest is partitioned into non-overlapping areas, each of which is assigned a dedicated CAV group to perform localized perception. A designated leader in each group collects and fuses perception data from its members, and uploads the perception result to the roadside unit (RSU), establishing a link between local perception and global awareness. The RSU aggregates perception results from all groups and broadcasts a global view to all CAVs. LGCP employs a centralized scheduling strategy via the RSU, which assigns CAV groups to each area, schedules their transmissions, aggregates area-level local perception results, and propagates the global view to all CAVs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LGCP framework achieves an average 44 times reduction in the amount of data transmission, while maintaining or even improving the overall collaborative performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u534f\u4f5c\u548cRSU\u96c6\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u56e0\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u672c\u5730\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff08LGCP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9053\u8def\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u7528CAV\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u518d\u7531RSU\u96c6\u4e2d\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLGCP\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8644\u500d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LGCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the performance of Starlink networks in mobility settings, particularly with frequent changes in the UT's orientation, and the impact of environmental factors, such as transient obstructions, has not been thoroughly studied, leaving gaps in understanding the causes of performance degradation. Recently, researchers have started identifying the communicating satellites to evaluate satellite selection strategies and the impact on network performance. However, existing Starlink satellite identification methods only work in stationary, obstruction-free scenarios, as they do not account for UT mobility, obstructions or detect dynamic beam switching events. In this paper, we reveal that the UT can perform multiple dynamic beam switching attempts to connect to different satellites when the UT-satellite link is degraded. This degradation can occur either due to the loss of line-of-sight (LoS) from changes in the FOV or obstructions, or due to poor signal quality, extending UT-satellite handovers beyond the well-known 15-second regular handover interval. We propose a mobility-aware Starlink satellite identification method that detects dynamic beam switching events, and plausibly explain network performance using UT's diagnostic data and connected satellite information.

Although large language models (LLMs) provide a promising training-free alternative to unsupervised approaches, their effectiveness in aerospace settings remains under-examined because of complex telemetry, misaligned evaluation metrics, and the absence of domain knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce ATSADBench, the first benchmark for aerospace TSAD. ATSADBench comprises nine tasks that combine three pattern-wise anomaly types, univariate and multivariate signals, and both in-loop and out-of-loop feedback scenarios, yielding 108,000 data points. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under two paradigms: Direct, which labels anomalies within sliding windows, and Prediction-Based, which detects anomalies from prediction errors. To reflect operational needs, we reformulate evaluation at the window level and propose three user-oriented metrics: Alarm Accuracy (AA), Alarm Latency (AL), and Alarm Contiguity (AC), which quantify alarm correctness, timeliness, and credibility. We further examine two enhancement strategies, few-shot learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to inject domain knowledge. The evaluation results show that (1) LLMs perform well on univariate tasks but struggle with multivariate telemetry, (2) their AA and AC on multivariate tasks approach random guessing, (3) few-shot learning provides modest gains whereas RAG offers no significant improvement, and (4) in practice LLMs can detect true anomaly onsets yet sometimes raise false alarms, which few-shot prompting mitigates but RAG exacerbates.

A recent trend is to develop RL systems with a fully disaggregated architecture, which decouples the three RL phases (rollout, reward, and training) onto separate resources and executes them asynchronously. However, two critical data-level concerns arise: (1) asynchronous execution leads to data staleness in trajectories (the data generated by rollout) as the model parameters used in rollout may not be up to date, which impairs RL convergence; and (2) the length variation of trajectories introduces severe data skewness, leading to workload imbalance and degraded system performance.\n  Existing systems fail to address these two concerns in a unified manner. Techniques that tightly control data staleness often constrain effective data skewness mitigation, while aggressive data skewness mitigation tends to exacerbate data staleness. As a result, systems are forced to trade off convergence for performance, or vice versa. To address this, we propose StaleFlow, an RL post-training system that jointly tackles data staleness and skewness. First, to control staleness, StaleFlow introduces a global consistency protocol that tracks the full lifecycle of each trajectory and constrains staleness. Second, to mitigate skewness, StaleFlow re-designs the RL system architecture by constructing data servers for trajectories and parameters to achieve flexible rollout coordination. Subsequently, we develop a suite of staleness-aware, throughput-oriented strategies to enhance system performance.

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected.

In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT) framework that captures the essential spatial and temporal characteristics of wireless channels and traffic patterns, enabling the prediction of likely future network scenarios while respecting physical constraints. Leveraging this predictive capability, we introduce two analytically derived performance upper bounds-one based on Shannon capacity and the other on latency behavior under CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)-that can be evaluated efficiently without time-consuming network simulations. By applying importance sampling to DT-generated scenarios, potentially risky network conditions can be identified within large stochastic scenario spaces. These same performance bounds are then used to proactively guide a gradient-based search for improved network configurations, with the objective of avoiding imminent performance degradation rather than pursuing globally optimal but fragile solutions.

To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots. Results demonstrate superior performance on the HumanML3D-X benchmark for human whole-body motion generation, and our introduced reinforcement learning fine-tuning consistently improves both motion tracking accuracy and task success rates of these humanoid robots.

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature.

In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. \"foveated\") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a \"same\" or \"different\" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetamerGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u56f4\u548c\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u770b\u8005\u6ce8\u89c6\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u56f4\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u201c\u8981\u70b9\u201d\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u7406\u89e3\u3002MetamerGen\u65e8\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f5c\u5728\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "MetamerGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ece\u5916\u56f4\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8981\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4ece\u573a\u666f\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u6d41\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u89c6\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5916\u56f4\u9000\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86MetamerGen\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f5c\u5728\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u770b\u8005\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u533a\u57df\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u540c\u6784\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MetamerGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u5904\u7406\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

While this level of abstraction has enabled a rich body of results, it limits the ability to represent structural dependencies that are central in many structured argumentation formalisms, in particular subargument relations. Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties.

Existing caching-based acceleration methods typically rely on $\\textit{static}$ schedules that fail to adapt to the $\\textit{dynamics}$ of robot-environment interactions, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$parse $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ction$\\underline{\\textbf{G}}$en ($\\textbf{SAG}$) for extremely sparse action generation. To accommodate the iterative interactions, SAG customizes a rollout-adaptive prune-then-reuse mechanism that first identifies prunable computations globally and then reuses cached activations to substitute them during action diffusion. To capture the rollout dynamics, SAG parameterizes an observation-conditioned diffusion pruner for environment-aware adaptation and instantiates it with a highly parameter- and inference-efficient design for real-time prediction. Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that SAG achieves up to 4$\\times$ generation speedup without sacrificing performance.

Category-Partition proceeds in several steps, from the identification of so-called categories and choices, possibly constrained, which are subsequently used to form test frames, i.e., combinations of choices, and eventually test cases. This paper reports on an ongoing attempt to automate as many of those steps as possible, with graphical-user interface tool support. Specifically, the user interface allows the user to specify parameters as well as so-called environment variables, further specify categories and choices with optional constraints. Choices are provided with precise specifications with operations specific to their types (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Real, String). Then, the tool automates the construction of test frames, which are combinations of choices, according to alternative selection criteria, and the identification of input values for parameters and environment variables for these test frames, thereby producing test cases.

Open RAN enables programmability through xApps, yet deploying and validating these applications is critical given the nature of the systems they aim to control. Current Open RAN ecosystems lack robust lifecycle management of xApps that enable automated testing, seamless migration, and production-grade observability, resulting in slow, error-prone xApp delivery. To address these issues, DevOps practices can streamline the xApp lifecycle by integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with advanced traffic management and monitoring, such as leveraging service mesh technologies to enable progressive deployment strategies (e.g., canary releases and A/B testing) to ensure fine-grained observability and resilience. The solution presented in this article, MANATEE (Mesh Architecture for Radio Access Network Automation and TEsting Ecosystems), is the first platform that combines these principles to simplify xApp delivery into production, accelerate innovation, and guarantee performance across heterogeneous O-RAN environments. We prototyped MANATEE on a Kubernetes cluster integrated with the O-RAN Software Community Near-Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), as well as with service mesh technologies, to facilitate testing of xApps across simulated, emulated, and real testbed environments.

Recent works incorporate reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance the robustness of diffusion planners through reward-oriented optimization in a generation-evaluation loop. However, they struggle to generate multi-modal, scenario-adaptive trajectories, hindering the exploitation efficiency of informative rewards during fine-tuning. To resolve this, we propose PlannerRFT, a sample-efficient reinforcement fine-tuning framework for diffusion-based planners. PlannerRFT adopts a dual-branch optimization that simultaneously refines the trajectory distribution and adaptively guides the denoising process toward more promising exploration, without altering the original inference pipeline.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) serves as the de facto standard for describing REST APIs and is crucial for multiple software engineering tasks.

Although static analysis shows potential for OAS generation, it is limited to specific programming languages and development frameworks. The powerful code understanding capabilities of LLMs offer new opportunities for OAS generation, yet they are constrained by context limitations and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose the OpenAI OpenAPI Project Scanner (OOPS), the first technology-agnostic LLM-based static analysis method for OAS generation, requiring fewer technology-specific rules and less human expert intervention. OOPS is implemented as an LLM agent workflow comprising two key steps: endpoint method extraction and OAS generation. By constructing an API dependency graph, it establishes necessary file associations to address LLMs' context limitations. Through multi-stage generation and self-refine, it mitigates both syntactic and semantic hallucinations during OAS generation. We evaluated OOPS on 12 real-world REST APIs spanning 5 programming languages and 8 development frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that OOPS accurately generates high-quality OAS for REST APIs implemented with diverse technologies, achieving an average F1-score exceeding 98% for endpoint method inference, 97% for both request parameter and response inference, and 92% for parameter constraint inference.

Such tool-based agents are rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for deploying language models in production. Unlike traditional single-turn inference, agentic workloads chain together multiple LLM calls and tool executions before producing a final response, creating a new performance bottleneck that manifests as increased latency in First Token Rendered (FTR) of the final answer. Through analysis of synthetic requests at production scale, we reveal three critical challenges: tool calls account for 30-80% of FTR latency, KV cache hit rates collapse despite substantial context reuse across iterations, and sequential orchestration wastes potential intra-request parallelism by sequentially executing LLM calls and tools. These bottlenecks stem from a design gap in which orchestrators and LLM engines operate as decoupled black boxes, preventing cross-layer optimizations. We present SUTRADHARA, a co-designed agentic inference system that integrates orchestration with LLM serving through a thin API enabling three optimizations: overlap tool execution with subsequent LLM prefill using tool-aware prompt splitting, streaming tool execution to dispatch tools incrementally during decode rather than waiting for complete output, and orchestrator-aware cache management that uses semantic hints to improve hit rates and reduce thrashing. Implemented on vLLM, SUTRADHARA reduces median FTR latency by 15% and end-to-end latency by 10% across workloads on A100 GPUs, demonstrating that co-design can systematically tame latency in agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "SUTRADHARA\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u7f16\u6392\u6d6a\u8d39\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SUTRADHARA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u7f16\u6392\u4e0eLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6d41\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u548c\u7f16\u6392\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728A100 GPU\u4e0a\uff0cSUTRADHARA\u5c06\u4e2d\u4f4dFTR\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8615%\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8610%\u3002", "conclusion": "SUTRADHARA\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the robustness of existing methods remains a critical challenge when confronting novel or evolving tools. Existing trajectory-centric paradigms primarily rely on memorizing static solution paths during training, which limits the ability of LLMs to generalize tool usage to newly introduced or previously unseen tools. In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolMaster significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of generalization and robustness across unseen or unfamiliar tools.

However, with the emergence of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), concerns about economic centralization and content manipulation have intensified. To address these vulnerabilities, the Ethereum community has introduced Proposer Builder Separation (PBS), which separates block construction from block proposal. Later, enshrined Proposer Builder Separation (ePBS) was also proposed in EIP-7732, which embeds PBS directly into the Ethereum consensus layer.\n  Our work identifies key limitations of ePBS by developing a formal framework that combines mathematical analysis and agent-based simulations to evaluate its auction-based block-building mechanism, with particular emphasis on MEV dynamics. Our results reveal that, although ePBS redistributes responsibilities between builders and proposers, it significantly amplifies profit and content centralization: the Gini coefficient for profits rises from 0.1749 under standard PoS without ePBS to 0.8358 under ePBS. This sharp increase indicates that a small number of efficient builders capture most value via MEV-driven auctions. Moreover, 95.4% of the block value is rewarded to proposers in ePBS, revealing a strong economic bias despite their limited role in block assembly. These findings highlight that ePBS exacerbates incentives for builders to adopt aggressive MEV strategies, suggesting the need for future research into mechanism designs that better balance decentralization, fairness, and MEV mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ePBS\u901a\u8fc7\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u52a0\u5267\u5229\u6da6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u83b7\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728PoS\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0cMEV\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0cePBS\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30ePBS\u7684\u62cd\u5356\u5f0f\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "ePBS\u4e0b\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u4ece0.1749\u5347\u81f30.8358\uff0c95.4%\u7684\u533a\u5757\u4ef7\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed9\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "ePBS\u867d\u7136\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u8005\u548c\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5316\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548cMEV\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To validate the safety relevance and realism of the constructed prompts, we evaluate their refusal behavior across six widely deployed LLMs. Our analysis shows that the evaluated models often fail to appropriately refuse unsafe or non-compliant driving-related queries, underscoring the limitations of general-purpose safety alignment in driving contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveSafe\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u9a7e\u9a76\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u6570\u5b57\u52a9\u624b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u540e\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7279\u6709\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b129\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u5b50\u98ce\u9669\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u7ecf\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u672a\u80fd\u9002\u5f53\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveSafe \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u56db\u7ea7\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u9002\u5f53\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "ForeDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0880%\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad823%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ed\u671f\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u53bb\u566a\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForesight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion)\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u566a\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728Adroit\u5957\u4ef6\u548cMetaWorld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cForeDiffusion\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa23%\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "ForeDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u673a\u5236\uff08\u53bb\u566a\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u5e73\u574780%\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u51fa23%\u3002"}}

One approach is to completely abandon the concept of CPU -- and thus serial imperative programming -- and instead to specify and execute tasks in parallel, compiling from programming languages to data flow digital logic. It is well-known that pure functional languages are inherently parallel, due to the Church-Rosser theorem, and CPU-based parallel compilers exist for many functional languages. However, these still rely on conventional CPUs and their von Neumann bottlenecks. An alternative is to compile functional languages directly into digital logic to maximize available parallelism. It is difficult to work with complete modern functional languages due to their many features, so we demonstrate a proof-of-concept system using lambda calculus as the source language and compiling to digital logic. We show how functional hardware can be tailored to a simplistic functional language, forming the ground for a new model of CPU-less functional computation. At the algorithmic level, we use a tree-based representation, with data localized within nodes and communicated data passed between them. This is implemented by physical digital logic blocks corresponding to nodes, and buses enabling message passing. Node types and behaviors correspond to lambda grammar forms, and beta-reductions are performed in parallel allowing branches independent from one another to perform transformations simultaneously. As evidence for this approach, we present an implementation, along with simulation results, showcasing successful execution of lambda expressions. This suggests that the approach could be scaled to larger functional languages.

As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities.

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "TIDE\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eLTLf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002TIDE\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "TIDE\u5c06\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe-\u89c4\u907f\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6210\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u5931\u8d25\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTIDE\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u6269\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDE\uff08Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6210\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u6269\u5c55\u76ee\u6807\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning.

However, annotating conventional programs with the formal specification and verification constructs (preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants, auxiliary predicates and functions and proof helpers) required to prove their correctness still demands significant manual effort and expertise. This paper investigates how LLMs can automatically generate such annotations for programs written in Dafny, a verification-aware programming language, starting from conventional code accompanied by natural language specifications (in comments) and test code. In experiments on 110 Dafny programs, a multimodel approach combining Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 generated correct annotations for 98.2% of the programs within at most 8 repair iterations, using verifier feedback. A logistic regression analysis shows that proof-helper annotations contribute disproportionately to problem difficulty for current LLMs. Assertions in the test cases served as static oracles to automatically validate the generated pre/postconditions.

Focus on 6-DOF spacecraft rendezvous and docking control using imitation learning-based control method", "summary": "Existing spacecraft rendezvous and docking control methods largely rely on predefined dynamic models and often exhibit limited robustness in realistic on-orbit environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

Kim"], "title": "Improving Large Molecular Language Model via Relation-aware Multimodal Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their instruction-following capabilities and achieved powerful performance on various tasks. Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoLLaMo\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LMLMs\u5e38\u56e0\u5bf91D\u5e8f\u5217\u30012D\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u548c3D\u6784\u8c61\u7b49\u591a\u6837\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoLLaMo\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u591a\u7ea7\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u8fdb\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoLLaMo\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u8d28QA\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u8d28QA\u3001\u57fa\u5e8f\u8ba1\u6570\u548cIUPAC\u540d\u79f0\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "CoLLaMo\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LMLMs\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system.

While existing VLAs often struggle with morphological heterogeneity and data scarcity, we propose a human-centric learning paradigm that treats human interaction traces as a universal \"mother tongue\" for physical interaction. To support this, we present UniHand-2.0, the largest embodied pre-training recipe to date, comprising over 35,000 hours of multimodal data across 30 distinct robotic embodiments. Our approach introduces a Unified Action Space that maps heterogeneous robot controls into semantically aligned slots, enabling low-resource robots to bootstrap skills from human data and high-resource platforms. Built upon this human-centric foundation, we design a unified sequential modeling and multi-task pre-training paradigm to bridge human demonstrations and robotic execution. Architecturally, Being-H0.5 utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformers design featuring a novel Mixture-of-Flow (MoF) framework to decouple shared motor primitives from specialized embodiment-specific experts. Finally, to make cross-embodiment policies stable in the real world, we introduce Manifold-Preserving Gating for robustness under sensory shift and Universal Async Chunking to universalize chunked control across embodiments with different latency and control profiles.

The paper describes the architecture and core components of CODECO, outlines representative orchestration workflows, and introduces a software-based experimentation framework for reproducible evaluation in federated Edge-Cloud infrastructure environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CODECO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aKubernetes\u8054\u90a6\u7f16\u6392\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e-\u8ba1\u7b97-\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u6392\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Kubernetes\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u5f15\u5165AI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "CODECO\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Kubernetes\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u548cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "CODECO\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5e94\u7528\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "CODECO\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e-\u8ba1\u7b97-\u7f51\u7edc\u534f\u540c\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e91\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Recently, methods approaching the alignment of the intermediate features proven to be promising, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, these methods are laborious to implement and hard to interpret. Although promising, there is still room for improvements to close the performance gap toward the upper-bound (when training with the target data). In this work, we propose a method to generate an artificial dataset in the target domain to train an object detector. We employed two unsupervised image translators (CycleGAN and an AdaIN-based model) using only annotated data from the source domain and non-annotated data from the target domain. Our key contributions are the proposal of a less complex yet more effective method that also has an improved interpretability.

This paper investigates whether LLMs' code-comprehension performance aligns with traditional human-centric software metrics or instead reflects distinct, non-human regularities. We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures. These findings suggest that LLM comprehension reflects model-specific regularities only partially accessible through either human-designed or learned features, emphasizing the need for benchmark methodologies that move beyond aggregate accuracy and toward instance-level diagnostics, while acknowledging fundamental limits in predicting correct outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4e0eLLM\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6781\u5c0f\uff08AUROC 0.63\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUROC 0.86\uff09\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6709\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5f8b\u4ec5\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

This article presents a detailed analysis focused on quantifying and improving HPC resource utilization efficiency specifically within the LAGO computational environment. The core objective is to understand how LAGO's distinct computational workloads-characterized by a prevalent coarse-grained, task-parallel execution model-consume resources in practice. To achieve this, we analyze historical job accounting data from the EGI FedCloud platform, identifying primary workload categories (Monte Carlo simulations, data processing, user analysis/testing) and evaluating their performance using key efficiency metrics (CPU utilization, walltime utilization, and I/O patterns). Our analysis reveals significant patterns, including high CPU efficiency within individual simulation tasks contrasted with the distorting impact of short test jobs on aggregate metrics. This work pinpoints specific inefficiencies and provides data-driven insights into LAGO's HPC usage.

This study presents a fast, non-invasive multimodal deep learning framework for automatic binary stroke screening based on data collected during the F.A.S.T. assessment. The proposed approach integrates complementary information from facial expressions, speech signals, and upper-body movements to enhance diagnostic robustness. Facial dynamics are represented using landmark based features and modeled with a Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies. Speech signals are converted into mel spectrograms and processed using an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, while upper-body pose sequences are analyzed with an MLP-Mixer network to model spatiotemporal motion patterns. The extracted modality specific representations are combined through an attention-based fusion mechanism to effectively learn cross modal interactions. Experiments conducted on a self-collected dataset of 222 videos from 37 subjects demonstrate that the proposed multimodal model consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving 95.83% accuracy and a 96.00% F1-score. The model attains a strong balance between sensitivity and specificity and successfully detects all stroke cases in the test set.

This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence.

Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.\n  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.\n  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6301LTA\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u548c\u5149\u5bfc\u822a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5fae\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAVs\uff09\u5728GPS\u7f3a\u5931\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7eed\u822a\u77ed\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b80\u5316LTA\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u81ea\u6301LTA\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790LTA\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u5149\u4fe1\u6807\u7684\u5149\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u572880klux\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bcf4\u5206\u949f\u80fd\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53ef\u652f\u63011\u5206\u949f\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b07\u7c73\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5355\u5149\u4fe1\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8f7b\u4e8e\u7a7a\u6c14\uff08LTA\uff09\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u5149\u5bfc\u822a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6301\u4e45\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present the RASC (Request-Acknowledge-Start-Complete) abstraction, which provides acknowledgments at critical points after an IoT device action is initiated. RASC is a better fit for IoT actions, which naturally vary in length spatially (across devices) and temporally (across time, for a given device). RASC also enables the design of several new features: predicting action completion times accurately, detecting failures of actions faster, allowing fine-grained dependencies in programming, and scheduling. RASC is intended to be implemented atop today's available RPC mechanisms, rather than as a replacement. We integrated RASC into a popular and open-source IoT framework called Home Assistant. Our trace-driven evaluation finds that RASC meets latency SLOs, especially for long actions that last O(mins), which are common in smart spaces.

Patel"], "title": "RemoteVAR: Autoregressive Visual Modeling for Remote Sensing Change Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Remote sensing change detection aims to localize and characterize scene changes between two time points and is central to applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. Meanwhile, visual autoregressive models (VARs) have recently shown impressive image generation capability, but their adoption for pixel-level discriminative tasks remains limited due to weak controllability, suboptimal dense prediction performance and exposure bias. We introduce RemoteVAR, a new VAR-based change detection framework that addresses these limitations by conditioning autoregressive prediction on multi-resolution fused bi-temporal features via cross-attention, and by employing an autoregressive training strategy designed specifically for change map prediction. Extensive experiments on standard change detection benchmarks show that RemoteVAR delivers consistent and significant improvements over strong diffusion-based and transformer-based baselines, establishing a competitive autoregressive alternative for remote sensing change detection.

We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench.

However, existing inspection methods often rely on manual operations and conventional computer vision techniques that lack scalability and contextual understanding. This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

This paper introduces MeltRTL, a novel framework that integrates multi-expert attention with inference-time intervention (ITI) to significantly improve LLM-based RTL code generation accuracy without retraining the base model. MeltRTL introduces three key innovations: (1) A multi-expert attention architecture that dynamically routes design specifications to specialized expert networks, enabling targeted reasoning across various hardware categories; (2) An inference-time intervention mechanism that employs non-linear probes to detect and correct hardware-specific inaccuracies during generation; and (3) An efficient intervention framework that selectively operates on expert-specific attention heads with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate MeltRTL on the VerilogEval benchmark, achieving 96% synthesizability and 60% functional correctness, compared to the base LLM's 85.3% and 45.3%, respectively. These improvements are obtained entirely at inference time, with only 27% computational overhead and no model fine-tuning, making MeltRTL immediately deployable on existing pre-trained LLMs. Ablation studies further show the complementary benefits of multi-expert architecture and ITI, highlighting their synergistic effects when combined.", "AI": {"tldr": "MeltRTL\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u751f\u6210RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b57\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "MeltRTL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\uff08ITI\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u68c0\u6d4b\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728VerilogEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMeltRTL\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696%\u7684\u53ef\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u548c60%\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840LLM\u768485.3%\u548c45.3%\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u589e\u52a027%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MeltRTL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, for compute-intensive workloads-particularly web services executing containerized machine-learning training-the default Kubernetes scheduler does not always achieve optimal placement. To address this, we propose two custom, reinforcement-learning-based schedulers, SDQN and SDQN-n, both built on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework. In compute-intensive scenarios, these models outperform the default Kubernetes scheduler as well as Transformer-and LSTM-based alternatives, reducing average CPU utilization per cluster node by 10%, and by over 20% when using SDQN-n. Moreover, our results show that SDQN-n approach of consolidating pods onto fewer nodes further amplifies resource savings and helps advance greener, more energy-efficient data centers.Therefore, pod scheduling must employ different strategies tailored to each scenario in order to achieve better performance.Since the reinforcement-learning components of the SDQN and SDQN-n architectures proposed in this paper can be easily tuned by adjusting their parameters, they can accommodate the requirements of various future scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDQN\u7684Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668SDQN\u548cSDQN-n\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eCPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0cSDQN-n\u66f4\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08\u5982\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4Kubernetes\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u653e\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668SDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cSDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548cLSTM\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8282\u70b9\u5e73\u5747CPU\u5229\u7528\u738710%\u548c20%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002SDQN-n\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06pod\u6574\u5408\u5230\u66f4\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "Pod scheduling should\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002SDQN\u548cSDQN-n\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u6765\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction.

Cosserat rod framework is employed to establish the relationship between tendon actuation forces and the robot's overall shape. The effects of gravity, as an example of an external load, are investigated and implemented in the model and simulation. The experimental results indicate RMSE values of 1.76mm, 2.33mm, 2.18mm, and 1.33mm across four tested prototypes. Based on the helical shape of the ExoNav upon actuation, it is capable of performing follow-the-leader (FTL) motion by adding insertion and rotation DoFs to this robotic system, which is shown in simulation and experimentally. The proposed simulation has the capability to calculate optimum tendon tensions to follow the desired FTL paths while gravity-induced robot deformations are present. Three FTL experimental trials are conducted and the end-effector position showed repeatable alignments with the desired path with maximum RMSE value of 3.75mm. Ultimately, a phantom model demonstration is conducted where the teleoperated robot successfully navigated to the lateral and ventral spinal cord targets. Additionally, the user was able to navigate to the dorsal root ganglia, illustrating ExoNav's potential in both motor function recovery and pain management.", "AI": {"tldr": "ExoNav\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8f6c\u5411\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Cosserat\u6746\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u810a\u9ad3\u8179\u4fa7\u548c\u5916\u4fa7\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u52a8\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u810a\u9ad3\u523a\u6fc0\uff08SCS\uff09\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u810a\u9ad3\u8179\u4fa7\u548c\u5916\u4fa7\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ExoNav\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u8f6c\u5411\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528Cosserat\u6746\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6574\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u91cd\u529b\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u539f\u578b\u673a\u7684RMSE\u503c\u57281.33mm\u81f32.33mm\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ExoNav\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u968f\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff08FTL\uff09\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ExoNav\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u810a\u9ad3\u8179\u4fa7\u548c\u5916\u4fa7\u786c\u819c\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u5728\u91cd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f73\u808c\u8171\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u810a\u9ad3\u523a\u6fc0\uff08SCS\uff09\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u548c\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets.

While data generation methods are evolving rapidly, existing surveys are constrained by fragmented focuses on single modalities or specific tasks, lacking a unified perspective aligned with real-world workflows. To fill this gap, this survey establishes the first comprehensive technical map for data generation in DI. Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the \"availability of data and labels.\" This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction.

While traditional methods rely on rigid, pre-defined flight paths and intensive offline processing, informative path planning (IPP) offers a way to collect data adaptively where it is most needed. Gaussian process (GP) mapping provides a continuous model of weed distribution with built-in uncertainty. However, GPs must be discretised for practical use in autonomous planning. Many discretisation techniques exist, but the impact of discrete representation choice remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how different discrete GP representations influence both mapping quality and mission-level performance in UAV-based weed mapping. Considering a UAV equipped with a downward-facing camera, we implement a receding-horizon IPP strategy that selects sampling locations based on the map uncertainty, travel cost, and coverage penalties. We investigate multiple discretisation strategies for representing the GP posterior and use their induced map partitions to generate candidate viewpoints for planning. Experiments on real-world weed distributions show that representation choice significantly affects exploration behaviour and efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that discretisation is not only a representational detail but a key design choice that shapes planning dynamics, coverage efficiency, and computational load in online UAV weed mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u5316GP\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6742\u8349\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u79bb\u6563GP\u8868\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6742\u8349\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7684\u7ed8\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u9000\u89c6\u91ceIPP\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u65c5\u884c\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u60e9\u7f5a\u9009\u62e9\u91c7\u6837\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793aGP\u540e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u8868\u793a\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u89c4\u5212\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Previous research has shown how suitable prompt engineering could help developers in improving their code generation prompts. However, so far, there do not exist specific guidelines driving developers towards writing suitable prompts for code generation. In this work, we derive and evaluate development-specific prompt optimization guidelines. First, we use an iterative, test-driven approach to automatically refine code generation prompts, and we analyze the outcome of this process to identify prompt improvement items that lead to test passes. We use such elements to elicit 10 guidelines for prompt improvement, related to better specifying I/O, pre-post conditions, providing examples, various types of details, or clarifying ambiguities. We conduct an assessment with 50 practitioners, who report their usage of the elicited prompt improvement patterns, as well as their perceived usefulness, which does not always correspond to the actual usage before knowing our guidelines. Our results lead to implications not only for practitioners and educators, but also for those aimed at creating better LLM-aided software development tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa10\u6761\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u7ecf\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u5199\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u9879\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8610\u6761\u9488\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u8005\u53caLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of \"guess what\". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step.", "AI": {"tldr": "GW-VLM\u901a\u8fc7MS-VLS\u548cCCP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba4\u77e5\u5efa\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMS-VLS\u548cCCP\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5GW-VLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLM\u548cLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO val\u3001Pascal VOC\u3001DIOR\u548cNWPU-10\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGW-VLM\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GW-VLM\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MS-VLS\u548cCCP\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684OVOD\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following.

However, developing new laboratory workflows relies heavily on real-world experimental trials, and this can hinder scalability because of the need for numerous physical make-and-test iterations. Here we present MATTERIX, a multiscale, graphics processing unit-accelerated robotic simulation framework designed to create high-fidelity digital twins of chemistry laboratories, thus accelerating workflow development. This multiscale digital twin simulates robotic physical manipulation, powder and liquid dynamics, device functionalities, heat transfer and basic chemical reaction kinetics. This is enabled by integrating realistic physics simulation and photorealistic rendering with a modular graphics processing unit-accelerated semantics engine, which models logical states and continuous behaviors to simulate chemistry workflows across different levels of abstraction. MATTERIX streamlines the creation of digital twin environments through open-source asset libraries and interfaces, while enabling flexible workflow design via hierarchical plan definition and a modular skill library that incorporates learning-based methods. Our approach demonstrates sim-to-real transfer in robotic chemistry setups, reducing reliance on costly real-world experiments and enabling the testing of hypothetical automated workflows in silico.

However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario.

Although automated refactoring tools have been extensively studied, their practical applicability remains limited. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for automated code refactoring. The evaluation of such an LLM-driven approach, however, leaves unanswered questions about its effects on code quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on LLM-driven refactoring using GPT-4o, applied to 100 Python classes from the ClassEval benchmark. Unlike prior work, our study explores a wide range of class-level refactorings inspired by Fowler's catalog and evaluates their effects from three complementary perspectives: (i) behavioral correctness, verified through unit tests; (ii) code quality, assessed via Pylint, Flake8, and SonarCloud; and (iii) readability, measured using a state-of-the-art readability tool. Our findings show that GPT-4o generally produces behavior-preserving refactorings that reduce code smells and improve quality metrics, albeit at the cost of decreased readability.

Some researches have discovered that ``a backdoor path\" in the representations from forgery-irrelevant information to labels induces biased learning, thereby hindering the generalization. In this paper, these forgery-irrelevant information are collectively termed spurious correlations factors. Previous methods predominantly focused on identifying concrete, specific spurious correlation and designing corresponding solutions to address them. However, spurious correlations arise from unobservable confounding factors, making it impractical to identify and address each one individually. To address this, we propose an intervention paradigm for representation space. Instead of tracking and blocking various instance-level spurious correlation one by one, we uniformly model them as a low-rank subspace and intervene in them. Specifically, we decompose spurious correlation features into a low-rank subspace via orthogonal low-rank projection, subsequently removing this subspace from the original representation and training its orthogonal complement to capture forgery-related features. This low-rank projection removal effectively eliminates spurious correlation factors, ensuring that classification decision is based on authentic forgery cues. With only 0.43M trainable parameters, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, demonstrating excellent robustness and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u79fb\u9664\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9010\u4e00\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u97000.43M\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fbf\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To bridge these gaps, we propose Psych\u0113Chat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling.

However, existing domain-specific code benchmarks cannot evaluate the effectiveness of domain specialization methods, which focus on assessing what knowledge LLMs possess rather than how they acquire and apply new knowledge, lacking explicit knowledge corpora for developing domain specialization methods. To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A). Unlike previous benchmarks that only provide test sets for direct evaluation, KOCO-BENCH requires acquiring and applying diverse domain knowledge (APIs, rules, constraints, etc.) from knowledge corpora to solve evaluation tasks. Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal. Best-performing coding agent, Claude Code, achieves only 34.2%, highlighting the urgent need for more effective domain specialization methods.

CNNs running on edge devices must have a small architecture, and CNNs for robot vision applications involving on-site object recognition must be able to be trained efficiently to identify specific visual targets from data obtained under a limited variation of conditions. The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance. The results were compared after training on multiple CNN architectures with and without Gabor filters as preprocessing. The results showed that preprocessing with Gabor filters improves the generalization performance of CNNs and contributes to reducing the size of CNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3aCNN\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aCNN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684CNN\u9700\u8981\u5c0f\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e14\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08VNS\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3aCNN\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CNN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CNN\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f7f\u7528Gabor\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8CNN\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c0fCNN\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

In comparison, our closest animal relative, chimpanzees, lack the capacity to do so. With this paper, we aim to evaluate LLM performance in the area of knowledge state tracking and estimation. We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know. Results reveal that most current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve near-random performance on both tasks, and are substantially inferior to humans.

The earlier approach modeled code as attention-ready sequences that blended lightweight structure with behavioral context; however, it lacked explicit role disambiguation within classes and treated call edges uniformly. SEER addresses these limitations with two principled additions: (i) a spectral-entropy role encoder that derives per-member role embeddings from the Laplacian spectrum of each class's interaction graph, and (ii) a time-weighted calling context that assigns empirically calibrated duration priors to method categories (e.g., constructors, getters/setters, static calls, virtual dispatch, cloning). Together, these components sharpen the model's notion of \"who does what\" and \"how much it matters,\" while remaining portable across languages with minimal adaptation and fully compatible with Transformer-based sequence encoders. Importantly, SEER does not \"force\" a win by capacity or data; it nudges the classifier, steering attention toward role-consistent and temporally calibrated signals that matter most.

However, in this context, image retrieval typically focuses more on the image pairs of geometric matchability than on those of semantic similarity, a nuance that most existing deep learning-based methods guided by batched binaries (overlapping vs. non-overlapping pairs) fail to capture. In this paper, we introduce SupScene, a novel solution that learns global descriptors tailored for finding overlapping image pairs of similar geometric nature for SfM. First, to better underline co-visible regions, we employ a subgraph-based training strategy that moves beyond equally important isolated pairs, leveraging ground-truth geometric overlapping relationships with various weights to provide fine-grained supervision via a soft supervised contrastive loss. Second, we introduce DiVLAD, a DINO-inspired VLAD aggregator that leverages the inherent multi-head attention maps from the last block of ViT. And then, a learnable gating mechanism is designed to adaptively utilize these semantically salient cues with visual features, enabling a more discriminative global descriptor. Extensive experiments on the GL3D dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming NetVLAD while introducing a negligible number of additional trainable parameters. Furthermore, we show that the proposed training strategy brings consistent gains across different aggregation techniques.

Our evaluation encompassing three sequential tasks for complete proving: Extraction, Simplification, and Explanation, as well as an additional task of assessing Logic Completeness of the premise.

Unlike black-box API consumption, the reliability of user-managed orchestration remains a critical blind spot. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 705 real-world failures from the open-source DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen ecosystems.\n  Our analysis reveals a paradigm shift: white-box orchestration relocates the reliability bottleneck from model algorithmic defects to the systemic fragility of the deployment stack. We identify three key phenomena: (1) Diagnostic Divergence: runtime crashes distinctively signal infrastructure friction, whereas incorrect functionality serves as a signature for internal tokenizer defects. (2) Systemic Homogeneity: Root causes converge across divergent series, confirming reliability barriers are inherent to the shared ecosystem rather than specific architectures.

Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks.

The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation. Detected anomalies are validated using contextual information from the ANN pathway and continuously tracked to support anticipatory navigation strategies.

While Chat LLMs offer safety and Agentic workflows provide flexibility, they suffer from performance degradation and prohibitive latency, respectively. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series.

Reliable carbon-credit certification depends on mechanisms that connect actual, measured renewable-energy production to verifiable emission-reduction records. Although blockchain and IoT technologies have been applied to emission monitoring and trading, existing work offers limited support for certification processes, particularly for small and medium-scale renewable installations. This paper introduces a blockchain-based carbon-credit certification architecture, demonstrated through a 100 kWp photovoltaic case study, that integrates real-time IoT data collection, edge-level aggregation, and secure on-chain storage on a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts. Unlike approaches focused on trading mechanisms, the proposed system aligns with European legislation and voluntary carbon-market standards, clarifying the practical requirements and constraints that apply to photovoltaic operators.

While deep learning-based volumetric segmentation of brain MRI scans offers a promising avenue for assessing neonatal neurodevelopment, achieving accurate segmentation of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) in preterm infants remains challenging due to their comparable signal intensities (isointense appearance) on MRI during early brain development. To address this, we propose a novel segmentation neural network, named Hierarchical Dense Attention Network. Our architecture incorporates a 3D spatial-channel attention mechanism combined with an attention-guided dense upsampling strategy to enhance feature discrimination in low-contrast volumetric data. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, effectively tackling the challenge of isointense tissue differentiation. Furthermore, application of our algorithm confirms that WM and GM volumes in preterm infants are significantly lower than those in term infants, providing additional imaging evidence of the neurodevelopmental delays associated with preterm birth.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5c01\u95ed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5982\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

Interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) is a standard procedure for treating cervical cancer; it involves placing a radioactive source through a straight hollow needle within or in close proximity to the tumor and surrounding tissue. However, the use of straight needles limits surgical planning to a linear needle path. We present the OncoReach stylet, a handheld, tendon-driven steerable stylet designed for compatibility with standard ISBT 15- and 13-gauge needles. Building upon our prior work, we evaluated design parameters like needle gauge, spherical joint count and spherical joint placement, including an asymmetric disk design to identify a configuration that maximizes bending compliance while retaining axial stiffness.

Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDecoder Gradient Shields (DGSs)\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6c34\u5370\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a100%\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u5370\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u51fa\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDecoder Gradient Shields (DGSs)\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42(DGS-O)\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u5c42(DGS-I)\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42(DGS-L)\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dDGS-O\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6240\u6709DGS\u5747\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53bb\u96e8\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDGSs\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u65e0\u76d2\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs)\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u5230100%\u3002"}}

However, existing environment generation methods often emphasize visual realism (e.g., object diversity and layout coherence), overlooking a crucial aspect: logical diversity from the testing perspective. This limits the comprehensive evaluation of agent adaptability and planning robustness in distinct simulated environments. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment. Notably, it employs constraint solving for physical plausibility. Furthermore, we introduce LogicEnvEval, a novel benchmark comprising four quantitative metrics for environment evaluation.

However, many OSS projects face operational risks due to informal or centralized governance. This paper presents a practical case study of data.table, a high-performance R package widely adopted in production analytics pipelines, which underwent a community-led governance reform to address scalability and sustainability concerns. Before the reform, data.table faced a growing backlog of unresolved issues and open pull requests, unclear contributor pathways, and bottlenecks caused by reliance on a single core maintainer. In response, the community initiated a redesign of its governance structure. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of this transition through a mixed-methods approach, combining a contributor survey (n=17) with mining project repository data. Our results show that following the reform, the project experienced a 200% increase in new contributor recruitment, a drop in pull request resolution time from over 700 days to under a week, and a 3x increase in contributor retention. Community sentiment improved around transparency, onboarding, and project momentum, though concerns around fairness and conflict resolution remain.

The core of our system is an adaptive scheduling mechanism that reduces computational load by 65\\% compared to continuous processing by selectively activating modules such as, YOLOv8n for object detection, a custom FaceNet-based embedding system for facial recognition, and DeepFace's CNN for emotion classification. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy, with the object detection module achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.861, facial recognition attaining 88\\% accuracy, and emotion detection showing strong discriminatory power (AUC up to 0.97 for specific emotions), while operating at 5.6 frames per second.

This limitation motivates the design of a proprioceptive membrane that conforms to the surface of interest and infers 3D geometry by reconstructing its own deformation. Conventional shape-aware membranes typically rely on resistive, capacitive, or magneto-sensitive mechanisms. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as structural complexity, limited compliance during large-scale deformation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. This work presents a soft, flexible, and stretchable proprioceptive silicone membrane based on optical waveguide sensing. The membrane sensor integrates edge-mounted LEDs and centrally distributed photodiodes (PDs), interconnected via liquid-metal traces embedded within a multilayer elastomeric composite. Rich deformation-dependent light intensity signals are decoded by a data-driven model to recover the membrane geometry as a 3D point cloud. On a customized 140 mm square membrane, real-time reconstruction of large-scale out-of-plane deformation is achieved at 90 Hz with an average reconstruction error of 1.3 mm, measured by Chamfer distance, while maintaining accuracy for indentations up to 25 mm.

We present a longitudinal causal study of agent adoption in open-source repositories using staggered difference-in-differences with matched controls. Using the AIDev dataset, we define adoption as the first agent-generated pull request and analyze monthly repository-level outcomes spanning development velocity (commits, lines added) and software quality (static-analysis warnings, cognitive complexity, duplication, and comment density). Results show large, front-loaded velocity gains only when agents are the first observable AI tool in a project; repositories with prior AI IDE usage experience minimal or short-lived throughput benefits. In contrast, quality risks are persistent across settings, with static-analysis warnings and cognitive complexity rising roughly 18% and 35%, indicating sustained agent-induced complexity debt even when velocity advantages fade. These heterogeneous effects suggest diminishing returns to AI assistance and highlight the need for quality safeguards, provenance tracking, and selective deployment of autonomous agents.

Pages are then clustered according to the score distribution to adaptively select relevant content. The clustered pages are screened again by Top-K to keep the context compact. However, for short documents, clustering reliability decreases, so we use a relevance probability threshold to select pages. The selected pages alone are fed to a frozen LVLM for answer generation, eliminating the need for model fine-tuning. The proposed AVIR framework reduces the average page count required for question answering by 70%, while achieving an ANLS of 84.58% on the MP-DocVQA dataset-surpassing previous methods with significantly lower computational cost.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($\u03b5$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5e94\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u6570\u548c\u975e\u8865\u507f\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u5e8f\u6570\u89c4\u5219\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ce\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u6570\u3001\u975e\u8865\u507f\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u89c4\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u884c\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e8f\u6570\u548c\u975e\u8865\u507f\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u8282\u4fed\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u7684\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684AI\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Most existing active perception methods rely on iterative optimization, leading to high time and motion costs, and are tightly coupled with task-specific objectives, which limits their transferability. In this paper, we propose a general one-shot multimodal active perception framework for robotic manipulation. The framework enables direct inference of optimal viewpoints and comprises a data collection pipeline and an optimal viewpoint prediction network. Specifically, the framework decouples viewpoint quality evaluation from the overall architecture, supporting heterogeneous task requirements. Optimal viewpoints are defined through systematic sampling and evaluation of candidate viewpoints, after which large-scale training datasets are constructed via domain randomization. Moreover, a multimodal optimal viewpoint prediction network is developed, leveraging cross-attention to align and fuse multimodal features and directly predict camera pose adjustments.

Existing methods typically assume consistent news topic distribution between training and test phases, failing to detect fake news videos tied to emerging events and unseen topics. To bridge this gap, we introduce RADAR, the first framework that enables test-time adaptation to unseen news videos. RADAR pioneers a new retrieval-guided adaptation paradigm that leverages stable (source-close) videos from the target domain to guide robust adaptation of semantically related but unstable instances. Specifically, we propose an Entropy Selection-Based Retrieval mechanism that provides videos with stable (low-entropy), relevant references for adaptation. We also introduce a Stable Anchor-Guided Alignment module that explicitly aligns unstable instances' representations to the source domain via distribution-level matching with their stable references, mitigating severe domain discrepancies. Finally, our novel Target-Domain Aware Self-Training paradigm can generate informative pseudo-labels augmented by stable references, capturing varying and imbalanced category distributions in the target domain and enabling RADAR to adapt to the fast-changing label distributions.

In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view.

However, while competitive programming platforms provide abundant problems and solutions, high-quality test cases for verification remain scarce. Existing approaches attempt to synthesize test cases using Large Language Models (LLMs), but rely solely on the model's intrinsic generation capabilities without external feedback, frequently resulting in insufficiently diverse cases. To address this limitation, we propose a $\\textbf{Feedback-Driven Iterative Framework}$ for comprehensive test case construction. Specifically, our method leverages the LLM to generate initial test cases, executes them against known correct and incorrect solutions, and utilizes the failed results as feedback to guide the LLM in refining the test cases toward high fidelity and discriminability. We then apply this method to the CodeContests dataset to construct an optimized high-quality derivative, $\\textbf{CodeContests-O}$. Evaluating against the entire pool of solutions ($1.1 \\times 10^7$ in total), our dataset achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of $89.37\\%$ and True Negative Rate (TNR) of $90.89\\%$, significantly outperforming the CodeContests and CodeContests+ by margins of $4.32\\%$ and $9.37\\%$, respectively.

Traditional wheelchairs lack dynamic features, and many smart alternatives remain costly, single-modality, and limited in health integration. Motivated by the pressing demand for advanced, personalized, and affordable assistive technologies, we propose a comprehensive AI-IoT based smart wheelchair system that incorporates glove-based gesture control for hands-free navigation, real-time object detection using YOLOv8 with auditory feedback for obstacle avoidance, and ultrasonic for immediate collision avoidance. Vital signs (heart rate, SpO$_2$, ECG, temperature) are continuously monitored, uploaded to ThingSpeak, and trigger email alerts for critical conditions. Built on a modular and low-cost architecture, the gesture control achieved a 95.5\\% success rate, ultrasonic obstacle detection reached 94\\% accuracy, and YOLOv8-based object detection delivered 91.5\\% Precision, 90.2\\% Recall, and a 90.8\\% F1-score.

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD. These results show the feasibility of LLM-driven STEP model generation from natural language, showing its potential to democratize CAD design for manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "STEP-LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210STEP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u964d\u4f4eCAD\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95e8\u69db\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u5230CAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u6838\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u517c\u5bb9\u7684STEP\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u5176\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406STEP\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u6ce8\u91ca\uff09\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eChamfer Distance\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTEP-LLM\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eText2CAD\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5176\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982RAG\u6a21\u5757\u3001DFS\u91cd\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548cRL\uff09\u5747\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u91cd\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cSTEP-LLM\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210STEP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u964d\u4f4eCAD\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95e8\u69db\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In these environments robotic software systems increasingly operate amid (1) uncertainties, where symptoms are easy to observe but root causes are ambiguous, or (2) multiple uncertainties appear concurrently. We present SUNSET, a ROS2-based exemplar that enables rigorous, repeatable evaluation of architecture-based self-adaptation in such conditions.

Automated generation of issue reproduction tests from natural language issue descriptions enhances developer productivity by simplifying root cause analysis, promotes test-driven development -- \"test first, write code later\", and can be used for improving the effectiveness of automated issue resolution systems like coding agents. Existing methods proposed for this task predominantly rely on closed-source LLMs, with limited exploration of open models. To address this, we propose SWE-Tester -- a novel pipeline for training open-source LLMs to generate issue reproduction tests. First, we curate a high-quality training dataset of 41K instances from 2.6K open-source GitHub repositories and use it to train LLMs of varying sizes and families. The fine-tuned models achieve absolute improvements of up to 10\\% in success rate and 21\\% in change coverage on SWT-Bench Verified. Further analysis shows consistent improvements with increased inference-time compute, more data, and larger models.

Convolutional feature maps are reinterpreted as patch-level graphs, where nodes encode both appearance and spatial coordinates, and edges reflect local structural adjacency. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that rely on generic message passing, we introduce a custom structural propagation mechanism that explicitly models relative spatial relations as part of the reasoning process. This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability. While evaluated in a medical imaging context, the framework is domain-agnostic and aligns with the broader vision of graph-based reasoning across artificial intelligence systems.

A flexible silicone skin further increases contact friction and contact area, enabling stable grasps for diverse objects. Experiments show that the palm can deform up to 28%, matching human hand flexibility, while achieving more than twice the payload capacity and three times the contact area compared to a rigid palm design.

By monitoring a given STL specification, we can detect the executions that violate it, which are often referred to as counterexamples. In practice, these counterexamples may arise from different causes and thus are relevant to different system defects. To effectively address this, we need a proper criterion for classifying these counterexamples, by which we can comprehend the possible violation patterns and the distributions of these counterexamples with respect to the patterns. In this paper, we propose a classification criterion by using parametric signal temporal logic (PSTL) to represent each class. Due to this formalism, identifying the classes of a counterexample requires finding proper parameter values of PSTL that enable a class to include the counterexample. To improve the efficiency of class identification, we further derive an inclusion relation between different classes, and then propose a binary search-like approach over it that significantly prunes the classes needed to query.

To tell these actions apart, human often rely on the objects the driver is using, such as holding a phone compared with gripping the steering wheel. However, most existing driver-monitoring datasets lack accurate object-location annotations or do not link objects to their associated actions, leaving a critical gap for reliable action recognition. To address this, we introduce the Driver Action with Object Synergy (DAOS) dataset, comprising 9,787 video clips annotated with 36 fine-grained driver actions and 15 object classes, totaling more than 2.5 million corresponding object instances. DAOS offers multi-modal, multi-view data (RGB, IR, and depth) from front, face, left, and right perspectives. Although DAOS captures a wide range of cabin objects, only a few are directly relevant to each action for prediction, so focusing on task-specific human-object relations is essential. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Action-Object-Relation Network (AOR-Net). AOR-Net comprehends complex driver actions through multi-level reasoning and a chain-of-action prompting mechanism that models the logical relationships among actions, objects, and their relations. Additionally, the Mixture of Thoughts module is introduced to dynamically select essential knowledge at each stage, enhancing robustness in object-rich and object-scarce conditions.

This necessitates a focus on energy in space: spacecraft power systems (SPS), especially their health management (HM), given their role in power supply and high failure rates. Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making.

We found that over 67.5\\% of AI-co-authored PRs originate from contributors without prior code ownership. Despite this, the majority of repositories lack guidelines for AI-coding agent usage. Notably, we observed a distinct interaction pattern: AI-co-authored PRs are merged significantly faster with minimal feedback. In contrast to human-created PRs where non-owner developers receive the most feedback, AI-co-authored PRs from non-owners receive the least, with approximately 80\\% merged without any explicit review.

Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories.

Traditional threshold-based methods frequently encounter performance degradation due to very high false alarm rates caused by look-alike phenomena such as wind slicks and ship wakes. Here, a hybrid deep learning model, DeepSegFusion, is presented for oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The model uses SegNet and DeepLabV3+ integrated with an attention-based feature fusion mechanism to achieve better boundary precision as well as improved contextual understanding. Results obtained on SAR oil spill datasets, including ALOS PALSAR imagery, confirm that the proposed DeepSegFusion model achieves an accuracy of 94.85%, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5685, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9330. The proposed method delivers more than three times fewer false detections compared to individual baseline models and traditional non-segmentation methods, achieving a reduction of 64.4%.

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning.

The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover.

In practice, they often grow to substantial size and complexity, undergoing thousands of modifications over time due to evolution, refactoring, and maintenance. The rise of AI has sparked interest in how software modeling activities can be automated. Recently, LLM-based approaches for software model completion have been proposed, however, the state of the art supports only single-location model completion by predicting changes at a specific location. Going beyond, we aim to bridge the gap toward handling coordinated changes that span multiple locations across large, complex models. Specifically, we propose a novel global embedding-based next focus predictor, NextFocus, which is capable of multi-location model completion for the first time. The predictor consists of a neural network with an attention mechanism that is trained on historical software model evolution data. Starting from an existing change, it predicts further model elements to change, potentially spanning multiple parts of the model.

However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce GuideTouch, a compact, affordable, standalone wearable device designed for autonomous obstacle avoidance. The system integrates two vertically aligned Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, enabling three-dimensional environmental perception, and four vibrotactile actuators that provide directional haptic feedback. Proximity and direction information is communicated via an intuitive 4-point vibrotactile feedback system located across the user's shoulders and upper chest. For real-world robustness, the device includes a unique centrifugal self-cleaning optical cover mechanism and a sound alarm system for location if the device is dropped. We evaluated the haptic perception accuracy across 22 participants (17 male and 5 female, aged 21-48, mean 25.7, sd 6.1). Statistical analysis confirmed a significant difference between the perception accuracy of different patterns. The system demonstrated high recognition accuracy, achieving an average of 92.9% for single and double motor (primary directional) patterns. Furthermore, preliminary experiments with 14 visually impaired users validated this interface, showing a recognition accuracy of 93.75% for primary directional cues.

Although automated detection tools such as fuzzers have advanced considerably, effective resolution still often depends on human expertise. Existing automated vulnerability repair (AVR) methods rely heavily on manually provided annotations (e.g., fault locations or CWE labels), which are often difficult and time-consuming to obtain, while overlooking the rich, naturally embedded semantic context found in issue reports from developers.\n  In this paper, we present VulnResolver, the first LLM-based hybrid agent framework for automated vulnerability issue resolution. VulnResolver unites the adaptability of autonomous agents with the stability of workflow-guided repair through two specialized agents. The Context Pre-Collection Agent (CPCAgent) adaptively explores the repository to gather dependency and contextual information, while the Safety Property Analysis Agent (SPAAgent) generates and validates the safety properties violated by vulnerabilities.

However, existing interpretability methods typically suffer from either reliance on white-box model access or insufficient quantitative rigor. To address these limitations, we introduce FocaLogic, a novel model-agnostic framework designed to interpret and quantify visual model decision-making through logic-based representations. FocaLogic identifies minimal interpretable subsets of visual regions-termed visual focuses-that decisively influence model predictions. It translates these visual focuses into precise and compact logical expressions, enabling transparent and structured interpretations. Additionally, we propose a suite of quantitative metrics, including focus precision, recall, and divergence, to objectively evaluate model behavior across diverse scenarios. Empirical analyses demonstrate FocaLogic's capability to uncover critical insights such as training-induced concentration, increasing focus accuracy through generalization, and anomalous focuses under biases and adversarial attacks.

We present ANCHOR, a modular framework that makes decoupling and robustness explicit system-level primitives.

We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss.

However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated function/class-level generation (e.g., ClassEval) or modifications to existing codebases (e.g., SWE-Bench), neglecting complete microservice repository generation that reflects real-world 0-to-1 development workflows. To bridge this gap, we introduce RepoGenesis, the first multilingual benchmark for repository-level end-to-end web microservice generation, comprising 106 repositories (60 Python, 46 Java) across 18 domains and 11 frameworks, with 1,258 API endpoints and 2,335 test cases verified through a \"review-rebuttal\" quality assurance process. We evaluate open-source agents (e.g., DeepCode) and commercial IDEs (e.g., Cursor) using Pass@1, API Coverage (AC), and Deployment Success Rate (DSR).

It has been revealed that the gradient of Position Embeddings (PEs) in Transformer contains sufficient information, which can be used to reconstruct the input data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) framework. MJP starts with random token shuffling to break the token order, and then a learnable \\textit{unknown (unk)} position embedding is used to mask out the PEs of the shuffled tokens. In this manner, the local spatial information which is encoded in the position embeddings is disrupted, and the models are forced to learn feature representations that are less reliant on the local spatial information. Notably, with the careful use of MJP, we can not only improve models' robustness against gradient attacks, but also boost their performance in both vision and text application scenarios, such as classification for images (\\textit{e.g.,} ImageNet-1K) and sentiment analysis for text (\\textit{e.g.,} Yelp and Amazon).

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data.

Unlike existing methods relying predominantly on vision, whose performance degrades under varying illumination, background clutter, or partial visibility, the proposed approach integrates foundation-model-based visual perception with adaptive tactile exploration. The visual pipeline exploits SAM for instance segmentation and Florence for semantic refinement, followed by skeletonization, endpoint detection, and point-cloud extraction. Occluded cable segments are autonomously identified and explored with a tactile sensor, which provides local point clouds that are merged with the visual data through Euclidean clustering and topology-preserving fusion. A B-spline interpolation driven by endpoint-guided point sorting yields a smooth and complete reconstruction of the cable shape.

Most cloud removal (CR) methods are optimized for low-level fidelity and can over-smooth textures and boundaries that are critical for analysis-ready data (ARD), leading to a mismatch between visually plausible restoration and semantic utility. To bridge this gap, we propose TDP-CR, a task-driven multimodal framework that jointly performs cloud removal and land-cover segmentation. Central to our approach is a Prompt-Guided Fusion (PGF) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable degradation prompt to encode cloud thickness and spatial uncertainty. By combining global channel context with local prompt-conditioned spatial bias, PGF adaptively integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) information only where optical data is corrupted. We further introduce a parameter-efficient two-phase training strategy that decouples reconstruction and semantic representation learning. Experiments on the LuojiaSET-OSFCR dataset demonstrate the superiority of our framework: TDP-CR surpasses heavy state-of-the-art baselines by 0.18 dB in PSNR while using only 15\\% of the parameters, and achieves a 1.4\\% improvement in mIoU consistently against multi-task competitors, effectively delivering analysis-ready data.", "AI": {"tldr": "TDP-CR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PGF\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u53bb\u9664\u4e0e\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5b66\u9065\u611f\u5f71\u50cf\u5728\u4e91\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e91\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u590d\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPrompt-Guided Fusion\uff08PGF\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9000\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u4e91\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6574\u5408SAR\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728LuojiaSET-OSFCR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTDP-CR\u5728PSNR\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf0.18 dB\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752815%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728mIoU\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b1.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "TDP-CR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u53bb\u9664\u548c\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5c31\u7eea\u6570\u636e\uff08ARD\uff09\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness.

However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations.

We examine how and where maintainers provide this information, assess its validity, and explore coverage across individual libraries and their dependency chains. Our findings show that 81.6% of libraries include at least one valid e-mail address, with PyPI serving as the primary source (79.5%). When analyzing dependency chains, we observe that up to 97.8% of direct and 97.7% of transitive dependencies provide valid contact information.

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR.

To date, the most advanced test generators rely on generative AI to synthesize inputs; however, these approaches remain limited in providing semantic insight into the causes of misbehaviours and in offering fine-grained semantic controllability over the generated inputs. In this paper, we introduce Detect, a feature-aware test generation framework for vision-based deep learning (DL) models that systematically generates inputs by perturbing disentangled semantic attributes within the latent space. Detect perturbs individual latent features in a controlled way and observes how these changes affect the model's output. Through this process, it identifies which features lead to behavior shifts and uses a vision-language model for semantic attribution. By distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant features, Detect applies feature-aware perturbations targeted for both generalization and robustness. Empirical results across image classification and detection tasks show that Detect generates high-quality test cases with fine-grained control, reveals distinct shortcut behaviors across model architectures (convolutional and transformer-based), and bugs that are not captured by accuracy metrics. Specifically, Detect outperforms a state-of-the-art test generator in decision boundary discovery and a leading spurious feature localization method in identifying robustness failures. Our findings show that fully fine-tuned convolutional models are prone to overfitting on localized cues, such as co-occurring visual traits, while weakly supervised transformers tend to rely on global features, such as environmental variances. These findings highlight the value of interpretable and feature-aware testing in improving DL model reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Detect\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210AI\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "Detect\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "Detect\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Detect\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

Recent research tends to use modality-shared language prompts generated by CLIP to guide the learning of modal-invariant representations. Despite achieving optimal performance, such methods still face limitations in efficient spatial-temporal modeling, sufficient cross-modal interaction, and explicit modality-level loss guidance. To address these issues, we propose the language-driven sequence-level modal-invariant representation learning (LSMRL) method, which includes spatial-temporal feature learning (STFL) module, semantic diffusion (SD) module and cross-modal interaction (CMI) module. To enable parameter- and computation-efficient spatial-temporal modeling, the STFL module is built upon CLIP with minimal modifications. To achieve sufficient cross-modal interaction and enhance the learning of modal-invariant features, the SD module is proposed to diffuse modality-shared language prompts into visible and infrared features to establish preliminary modal consistency. The CMI module is further developed to leverage bidirectional cross-modal self-attention to eliminate residual modality gaps and refine modal-invariant representations. To explicitly enhance the learning of modal-invariant representations, two modality-level losses are introduced to improve the features' discriminative ability and their generalization to unseen categories.

Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations.

While previous research has identified widespread accessibility issues and raised awareness of developer challenges, there remains a lack of cross-platform, globally representative insights into how practitioners approach accessibility in practice. This paper presents findings from a mixed-methods survey of 110 mobile app developers across 43 countries, examining how platform ecosystems (iOS vs. Android) and developer experience shape accessibility practices. Results show that while developers recognize the importance of accessibility, they often rely on platform-specific guidelines and typically perform compliance testing late in the development process. Developers primarily implement text-focused features while struggling with API limitations and organizational constraints. Through systematic cross-platform comparison, we identify novel platform-specific barriers and demonstrate how accessibility practices differ across developer experience levels.

This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5f00\u59cb\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u5f7b\u5e95\u6216\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u573a\u666f\u7269\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u968f\u673a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6865\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u586b\u5145\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

To make accessible earlier, authors would like to put it on arxiv before the conference", "summary": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79.

To address this challenge, we present SandWorm, a biomimetic screw-actuated robot augmented by peristaltic motion to enhance locomotion, and SWTac, a novel event-based visuotactile sensor with an actively vibrated elastomer. The event camera is mechanically decoupled from vibrations by a spring isolation mechanism, enabling high-quality tactile imaging of both dynamic and stationary objects. For algorithm design, we propose an IMU-guided temporal filter to enhance imaging consistency, improving MSNR by 24%. Moreover, we systematically optimize SWTac with vibration parameters, event camera settings and elastomer properties. Motivated by asymmetric edge features, we also implement contact surface estimation by U-Net. Experimental validation demonstrates SWTac's 0.2 mm texture resolution, 98% stone classification accuracy, and 0.15 N force estimation error, while SandWorm demonstrates versatile locomotion (up to 12.5 mm/s) in challenging terrains, successfully executes pipeline dredging and subsurface exploration in complex granular media (observed 90% success rate).

However, this approach creates a critical tension between maintaining high-level general semantic understanding and learning low-level, fine-grained sensorimotor skills, often leading to \"catastrophic forgetting\" of the model's open-world capabilities. To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen \"Left Brain\", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable \"Right Brain\", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwinBrainVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u901a\u7528\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u201c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u4f4e\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u65f6\u4e27\u5931\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002TwinBrainVLA\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "TwinBrainVLA\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08AsyMoT\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u201c\u5de6\u8111\u201d\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u4e0e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u201c\u53f3\u8111\u201d\uff08\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728SimplerEnv\u548cRoboCasa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTwinBrainVLA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u7684\u5168\u9762\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TwinBrainVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7269\u7406\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u53d7\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5728\u52a0\u8f7d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u610fPython\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff08Bandit\u3001CodeQL\u3001Semgrep\uff09\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b89\u5168\u5f02\u5473\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CWE\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5bf9\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528YARA\u8bc6\u522b\u6076\u610f\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u7b7e\u540d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3001API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u8bba\u575b\u7684600\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u542b\u4e49\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u56f0\u60d1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RS-RVOS\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6RS-RVOS Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMQC-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5f31\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u622a\u65ad\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u5185\u5b58\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MQC-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5185\u5b58\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728RS-RVOS Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMQC-SAM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "MQC-SAM\u5728RS-RVOS Bench\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8d21\u732e\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86RS-RVOS\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Building upon EmoLat, a cross-modal sentiment transfer framework is proposed to manipulate image sentiment via joint embedding of text and EmoLat features. The network is optimized using a multi-objective loss incorporating semantic consistency, emotion alignment, and adversarial regularization. To support effective modeling, we construct EmoSpace Set, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising images with dense annotations on emotions, object semantics, and visual attributes.

We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness.

Most existing methods focus on salient, single foreground objects.

Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality annotation has led to a reliance on inharmonious synthetic data, resulting in poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a Foreground Consistent Learning model, dubbed as FCLM, to address the aforementioned issues.

Considering the data dilemma, we term the processing of synthetic data as domain adaptation problem where we propose a domain-invariant learning strategy to focus on foreground learning.

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528AI\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7C2V2\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003RAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u9ad8\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u516b\u5927RAI\u539f\u5219\uff08\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528AI\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86C2V2\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528AI\u56e0\u8f93\u51fa\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff08DoFo\uff09\u9ad8\u800c\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u63d0\u51faC2V2\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u901a\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ee1\u8db3RAI\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6cbfC2V2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u6216\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684RAI\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u901a\u7528AI\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86TIVS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTIVS-O\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7f13\u5b58\u548cOSR\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u653e\u5927\u6076\u610f\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f13\u5b58\u548c301\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u7f13\u5b58\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8641.6%\u7684LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6bd4\uff08OSR\uff09\u7684TIVS-O\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway.

Traditional deep learning approaches for this task often require extensive training data or CAD models, limiting their application in real-world industrial settings where data is scarce and object instances vary. We propose a novel method for 6DoF pose estimation focused specifically on bins used in industrial settings. We exploit the cuboid geometry of bins by first detecting intermediate 3D line segments corresponding to their top edges. Our approach extends the 2D line segment detection network LeTR to operate on structured point cloud data. The detected 3D line segments are then processed using a simple geometric procedure to robustly determine the bin's 6DoF pose. To evaluate our method, we extend an existing dataset with a newly collected and annotated dataset, which we make publicly available. We show that incorporating synthetic training data significantly improves pose estimation accuracy on real scans. Moreover, we show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art 6DoF pose estimation methods in terms of the pose accuracy (3 cm translation error, 8.2$^\\circ$ rotation error) while not requiring instance-specific CAD models during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u7bb1\u5b50\u76846DoF\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75283D\u7ebf\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700CAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c552D\u7ebf\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edcLeTR\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7bb1\u5b50\u9876\u90e8\u8fb9\u7f18\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4e2d\u95f43D\u7ebf\u6bb5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7a33\u5065\u786e\u5b9a\u7bb1\u5b50\u76846DoF\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9aCAD\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76846DoF\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u52303\u5398\u7c73\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c8.2\u00b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning.

While visual foundation models (VFMs) provide strong local features, most existing methods rely on a single model, overlooking the complementary cues offered by different VFMs. However, exploiting such complementary information inevitably alters token distributions, which challenges the stability of existing query-based global aggregation schemes. To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "DC-VLAQ \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e92\u8865 VFMs \u548c\u7a33\u5065\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u548c VLAQ \u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728 VPR \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08VPR\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 DC-VLAQ \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u548c Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ) \u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Pitts30k\u3001Tokyo24/7\u3001MSLS\u3001Nordland\u3001SPED \u548c AmsterTime \u7b49\u6807\u51c6 VPR \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDC-VLAQ \u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DC-VLAQ \u5728\u6807\u51c6 VPR \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations.

Existing detection methods achieve near-perfect performance when training and testing are conducted within the same domain, yet their effectiveness deteriorates substantially in crossdomain scenarios. This limitation is problematic, as new forgery techniques continuously emerge and detectors must remain reliable against unseen manipulations. To address this challenge, we propose the Real-Centered Detection Network (RCDN), a frequency spatial convolutional neural networks(CNN) framework with an Xception backbone that anchors its representation space around authentic facial images. Instead of modeling the diverse and evolving patterns of forgeries, RCDN emphasizes the consistency of real images, leveraging a dual-branch architecture and a real centered loss design to enhance robustness under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the DiFF dataset, focusing on three representative forgery types (FE, I2I, T2I), demonstrate that RCDN achieves both state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy and significantly stronger cross-domain generalization.

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts.

However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations.

Conventional image processing techniques cannot simultaneously address both issues, and manual intervention is often required due to the unknown boundary between denoising and deblurring. To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring.

This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics.

A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget.

However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development.

This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors.

However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "ECA\u539f\u5219\u548cCUA\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316AI\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u610f\u8bc6\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ECA\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CUA\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5408\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs) \u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCUA\u63a8\u7406\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u65e9\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6536\u655b\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebfLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "Explicit Cognitive Allocation (ECA) \u548c Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA) \u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u8f85\u52a9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u8d23\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We present VIRTUE, an MLLM-based versatile video retrieval framework that integrates corpus and moment-level retrieval capabilities while accommodating composed multimodal queries within a single architecture. We use contrastive alignment of visual and textual embeddings generated using a shared MLLM backbone to facilitate efficient embedding-based candidate search.

Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model can be adapted without further training to achieve competitive results on zero-shot moment retrieval, and state of the art results for zero-shot composed video retrieval. With additional training for reranking candidates identified in the embedding-based search, our model substantially outperforms existing MLLM-based retrieval systems and achieves retrieval performance comparable to state of the art specialized models which are trained on orders of magnitude larger data.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIRTUE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u4e1a\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u800cMLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eabMLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5d4c\u5165\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u572870\u4e07\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u65f6\u523b\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6MLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VIRTUE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eabMLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples.

However, histopathology images often contain artifacts introduced during slide preparation and digitization. Detecting and excluding them is essential to ensure reliable downstream analysis. Traditional supervised models typically require large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive and not generalizable to novel artifact types. To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model.

This thesis presents an innovative framework for detecting malignant masses in mammographic images by integrating the Pyramid Adaptive Atrous Convolution (PAAC) and Transformer architectures. The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer.

This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement).

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance.

This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

This yields unpredictable inference latency in deployment scenarios where strict Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operation budgets must be met. We propose AgenticPruner, a framework utilizing large language models to achieve MAC-constrained optimization through iterative strategy learning. Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search. Building upon isomorphic pruning's graph-based structural grouping, our method adds context-aware adaptation by analyzing patterns across pruning iterations, enabling automatic convergence to target MAC budgets within user-defined tolerance bands.\n  We validate our framework on ImageNet-1K across ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DeiT architectures. On CNNs, our approach achieves MAC targeting while maintaining or improving accuracy: ResNet-50 reaches 1.77G MACs with 77.04% accuracy (+0.91% vs baseline); ResNet-101 achieves 4.22G MACs with 78.94% accuracy (+1.56% vs baseline). For ConvNeXt-Small, pruning to 8.17G MACs yields 1.41x GPU and 1.07x CPU speedup with 45% parameter reduction.

Identifying brain regions by their cytoarchitecture enables various scientific analyses of the brain.

An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes.

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u79bbTransformer\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u4ee4\u724c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728ARC-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5373AI\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u79bb\u7684Transformer\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728VARC\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u534f\u8bae\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728ARC-1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523062.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\uff0860.2%\uff09\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u79bbTransformer\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u533a\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c4\u5219\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction. Extensive experiments across 11 image classification tasks show PCBM-ReD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, narrows the performance gap with end-to-end models, and exhibits better interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "PCBM-ReD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u524d\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u975e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6216\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "PCBM-ReD\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u6839\u636e\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u72ec\u7acb\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBMs\uff09\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "result": "PCBM-ReD\u572811\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PCBM-ReD\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u572811\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Experimental results show that the 11B small LLM fine-tuned with ScriptMind outperformed GPT-4o by 13%, achieving superior performance over commercial models in detection accuracy, false-positive reduction, scammer utterance prediction, and rationale quality.

Existing multimodal attacks often suffer from limited perturbation diversity and unstable multi-stage pipelines. To address these challenges, we propose 2S-GDA, a two-stage globally-diverse attack framework. The proposed method first introduces textual perturbations through a globally-diverse strategy by combining candidate text expansion with globally-aware replacement.

Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment.

Despite its clinical importance for workflow analysis and skill assessment, progress has been hindered by severe class imbalance, subtle visual variations, and the semantic interdependence among triplet components. Existing approaches often address only a subset of these challenges rather than tackling them jointly, which limits their ability to form a holistic understanding. This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup. Its temporal extension, CurConMix+, integrates a Multi-Resolution Temporal Transformer (MRTT) that achieves robust, context-aware understanding by adaptively fusing multi-scale temporal features and dynamically balancing spatio-temporal cues. Furthermore, we introduce LLS48, a new, hierarchically annotated benchmark for complex laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, providing step-, task-, and action-level annotations. Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and LLS48 demonstrate that CurConMix+ not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in triplet recognition, but also exhibits strong cross-level generalization, as its fine-grained features effectively transfer to higher-level phase and step recognition tasks.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can assess the consistency of small subsets of facts, their judgments are noisy, and pairwise checks are insufficient to guarantee global coherence. We formalize this problem and show that verifying global consistency requires exponentially many oracle queries in the worst case. To make the task practical, we propose an adaptive divide-and-conquer algorithm that identifies minimal inconsistent subsets (MUSes) of facts and optionally computes minimal repairs through hitting-sets.

Considering that upsampling operations leave unique and distinguishable frequency fingerprints in both texture-poor and texture-rich regions, we focus our research on the detection of frequency-domain artifacts, aiming to fundamentally improve the generalization performance of the model. Specifically, we introduce a learnable frequency attention module that adaptively weights and enhances discriminative frequency bands by synergizing spatial texture analysis and spectral dependencies.On the AIGCDetectBenchmark, which includes 17 categories of generative models, S 2 F-Net achieves a detection accuracy of 90.49%, significantly outperforming various existing baseline methods in cross-domain detection scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "S 2 F-Net\u5229\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aS 2 F-Net\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u6027\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u7eb9\u7406\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b17\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684AIGCDetectBenchmark\u4e0a\uff0cS 2 F-Net\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090.49%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "S 2 F-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u7eb9\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u9891\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

The traditional static routing strategy most time cannot tolerate the traffic congestion and fluctuating retail demand. In this paper, we propose a Risk-Aware Dynamic Routing(RADR) framework which integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with combinatorial optimization. We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain. Particularly in the case study of high congestion scenarios, our method reduces the potential congestion risk exposure by 19.3% while only increasing the transportation distance by 2.1%.

We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality.

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research.

To bridge this gap, we propose EmoKGEdit, a novel training-free framework for precise and structure-preserving image emotion editing. Specifically, we construct a Multimodal Sentiment Association Knowledge Graph (MSA-KG) to disentangle the intricate relationships among objects, scenes, attributes, visual clues and emotion.

Dissecting Probabilistic Confidence in Best-of-N Selection", "comment": "15 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u6355\u6349\u5230\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u7c7b\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7834\u574f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ec5\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u7684\u662f\u8868\u9762\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u56e0\u679c\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9694\u79bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief.

Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph.

However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC.", "AI": {"tldr": "DARC\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u8026\u6846\u67b6\uff08Questioner\u96be\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3+Solver\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u6f14\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\uff08i\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\uff08ii\uff09\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u81ea\u4e3e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "DARC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3Questioner\u751f\u6210\u96be\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3Solver\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u751fSolver\u3002", "result": "DARC\u5728\u4e5d\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610.9\u5206\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DARC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a8\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u574710.9\u5206\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002"}}

Unlike most existing approaches that primarily test inner lookahead knowledge via Q\\\\&A, our benchmark evaluates model behavior in practical scenarios. To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size.

This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark. We believe this framework provides a practical and efficient baseline for future research in semantic correspondence.

Crop segmentation is a fundamental task for modern agriculture, which closely relates to many downstream tasks such as plant phenotyping, density estimation, and weed control. In the era of foundation models, a number of generic large language and vision models have been developed. These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively).

Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Human Simulation Computation (HSC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u95ed\u73af\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u601d\u8003\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HSC\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions. While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden).

As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u90bb\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u5f53\u6216\u67e5\u8be2\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "ARK\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u8bcd\u6c47\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u4e00\u8df3\u90bb\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u9884\u8bbe\u8df3\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728STaRK\u4e0a\uff0cARK\u7684\u5e73\u5747Hit@1\u8fbe\u523059.1%\uff0cMRR\u8fbe\u523067.4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ARK\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a \"granularity gap\" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5341\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e38\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u3001\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6574\u5408\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DERM12345\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "MedImageInsights\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u657097.52%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea640\u7c7b\u4e9a\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u964d\u81f365.50%\u3002\u800cMedSigLip\uff0869.79%\uff09\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u5206\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem.

Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval.

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition.

Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence.

Due to parameter sensitivity, further complications arise for stereo matching with sparse features, such as facial landmarks. To overcome this ill-posedness and enable unsupervised sparse matching, we consider line constraints of the camera geometry from an optimal transport (OT) viewpoint. Formulating camera-projected points as (half)lines, we propose the use of the classical epipolar distance as well as a 3D ray distance to quantify matching quality. Employing these distances as a cost function of a (partial) OT problem, we arrive at efficiently solvable assignment problems. Moreover, we extend our approach to unsupervised object matching by formulating it as a hierarchical OT problem. The resulting algorithms allow for efficient feature and object matching, as demonstrated in our numerical experiments.

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors. Experiments demonstrate that SkeFi realizes state-of-the-art performances on mmWave and LiDAR.

These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training.

However, current benchmarks, based on small, curated datasets, fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity and large spatial context of in-the-wild EM data, imposing fundamental limitations on current patch-based methods. To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement. We further benchmarked several state-of-the-art models, including U-Net, SAM variants, and Mask2Former. Our results show several limitations: current models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous EM data and perform poorly on organelles with global, distributed morphologies (e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum). These findings underscore the fundamental mismatch between local-context models and the challenge of modeling long-range structural continuity in the presence of real-world variability.

Motivated by this class-specific observation, we propose DCAC (Dynamic Class-Aware Cache), a training-free, test-time calibration module that maintains separate caches for each ID class to collect high-entropy samples and calibrate the raw predictions of input samples. DCAC leverages cached visual features and predicted probabilities through a lightweight two-layer module to mitigate overconfident predictions on OOD samples. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various existing OOD detection methods across both unimodal and vision-language models while introducing minimal computational overhead.

In this work, we introduce Histopath-C, a new benchmark with realistic synthetic corruptions designed to mimic real-world distribution shifts observed in digital histopathology. Our framework dynamically applies corruptions to any available dataset and evaluates Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) mechanisms on the fly. We then propose LATTE, a transductive, low-rank adaptation strategy that exploits multiple text templates, mitigating the sensitivity of histopathology VLMs to diverse text inputs. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods originally designed for natural images across a breadth of histopathology datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed design for robust adaptation in histopathology images.

To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking.

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

However, most studies utilize specialized, high-resolution eye-tracking equipment, limiting the potential reach of findings. We investigate how eye movement can be used to predict multimodal markers of emotional expression from naturalistic, low-resolution videos. We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech.

This paper addresses the planar Perspective--$n$--Point problem, with special emphasis on the initial estimation of the pose of a calibration object. As a solution, we propose the \\texttt{PnP-ProCay78} algorithm, which combines the classical quadratic formulation of the reconstruction error with a Cayley parameterization of rotations and least-squares optimization. The key component of the method is a deterministic selection of starting points based on an analysis of the reconstruction error for two canonical vectors, allowing costly solution-space search procedures to be avoided. Experimental validation is performed using data acquired also from high-resolution RGB cameras and very low-resolution thermal cameras in an integrated RGB--IR setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves practically the same projection accuracy as optimal \\texttt{SQPnP} and slightly higher than \\texttt{IPPE}, both prominent \\texttt{PnP-OpenCV} procedures. However, \\texttt{PnP-ProCay78} maintains a significantly simpler algorithmic structure. Moreover, the analysis of optimization trajectories in Cayley space provides an intuitive insight into the convergence process, making the method attractive also from a didactic perspective.

We postulate that visual/geometrical and textual representations of spatial structure must be combined at some point in VLM computations. We search for such confluence, and ask whether the identified representation can causally explain aspects of input-output model behavior through a linear model. We show empirically that VLMs encode object locations by linearly binding \\textit{spatial IDs} to textual activations, then perform reasoning via language tokens. Through rigorous causal interventions we demonstrate that these IDs, which are ubiquitous across the model, can systematically mediate model beliefs at intermediate VLM layers. Additionally, we find that spatial IDs serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying limitations in existing VLMs, and as a valuable learning signal. We extend our analysis to video VLMs and identify an analogous linear temporal ID mechanism. By characterizing our proposed spatiotemporal ID mechanism, we elucidate a previously underexplored internal reasoning process in VLMs, toward improved interpretability and the principled design of more aligned and capable models.

We analyze a Swin-Transformer based U-Net model (Swin-BathyUNet) to understand how it infers depth and when its predictions are trustworthy. A leave-one-band out study ranks spectral importance to the different bands consistent with shallow water optics. We adapt ablation-based CAM to regression (A-CAM-R) and validate the reliability via a performance retention test: keeping only the top-p% salient pixels while neutralizing the rest causes large, monotonic RMSE increase, indicating explanations localize on evidence the model relies on. Attention ablations show decoder conditioned cross attention on skips is an effective upgrade, improving robustness to glint/foam. Cross-region inference (train on one site, test on another) reveals depth-dependent degradation: MAE rises nearly linearly with depth, and bimodal depth distributions exacerbate mid/deep errors.

Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "A mixed precision framework for PointPillars optimizes LIDAR 3D object detection by addressing quantization challenges, achieving real-time performance with reduced latency and size.", "motivation": "To enable real-time LIDAR 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles while mitigating performance degradation from model quantization due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and outliers.", "method": "The framework involves searching for sensitive layers with PTQ, assigning top-k layers as FP, and greedily searching combinations to produce mixed precision models.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that leverages neural implicit representations for depth and BRDF modeling under the assumption of mono-chromaticity (uniform chromaticity and homogeneous material), which alleviates the inherent ill-posedness of color photometric stereo and allows for detailed surface recovery from just one image.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VILTA (VLM-In-the-Loop Trajectory Adversary), a novel framework that integrates a VLM into the closed-loop training of AD agents. Unlike prior works, VILTA actively participates in the training loop by comprehending the dynamic driving environment and strategically generating challenging scenarios through direct, fine-grained editing of surrounding agents' future trajectories. This direct-editing approach fully leverages the VLM's powerful generalization capabilities to create a diverse curriculum of plausible yet challenging scenarios that extend beyond the scope of traditional methods. We demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the safety and robustness of the resulting AD policy, particularly in its ability to navigate critical long-tail events.", "AI": {"tldr": "VILTA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8f91\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AD\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "VILTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06VLM\u96c6\u6210\u5230AD\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u8f91\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "VILTA\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AD\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "VILTA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u8f91\u5468\u56f4\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLM\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AD\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5c3e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

To suppress thermal radiation and heat haze using fusion-restoration image processing methods, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of DIC in the measurement of high-temperature deformation. For image degradation caused by thermal radiation, based on the image layered representation, the image is decomposed into positive and negative channels for parallel processing, and then optimized for quality by multi-exposure image fusion. To counteract the high-frequency, random errors introduced by heat haze, we adopt the FSIM as the objective function to guide the iterative optimization of model parameters, and the grayscale average algorithm is applied to equalize anomalous gray values, thereby reducing measurement error. The proposed multi-exposure image fusion algorithm effectively suppresses image degradation caused by complex illumination conditions, boosting the effective computation area from 26% to 50% for under-exposed images and from 32% to 40% for over-exposed images without degrading measurement accuracy in the experiment. Meanwhile, the image restoration combined with the grayscale average algorithm reduces static thermal deformation measurement errors. The error in \u03b5_xx is reduced by 85.3%, while the errors in \u03b5_yy and \u03b3_xy are reduced by 36.0% and 36.4%, respectively.

Extensive experiments across standard and challenging MLCIL settings on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC show that P2L-CA not only achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods but also demonstrates strong generalization in CIL scenarios, all while requiring minimal trainable parameters and eliminating the need for memory buffers.", "AI": {"tldr": "P2L-CA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0cP2L-CA\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "P2L-CA\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Prompt-to-Label\u6a21\u5757\u548cContinuous Adapter\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7f13\u89e3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728MS-COCO\u548cPASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cP2L-CA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6781\u5c11\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "P2L-CA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data.

Parametric 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) have been widely used for facial reconstruction due to their compact and interpretable parameterization, yet existing 3DMM regressors often exhibit poor consistency across varying viewpoints. To address this, we harness the pre-trained 3D prior of LRM and incorporate FLAME-based 2D Gaussian Splatting into LRM's rendering pipeline. Specifically, KaoLRM projects LRM's pre-trained triplane features into the FLAME parameter space to recover geometry, and models appearance via 2D Gaussian primitives that are tightly coupled to the FLAME mesh. The rich prior enables the FLAME regressor to be aware of the 3D structure, leading to accurate and robust reconstructions under self-occlusions and diverse viewpoints.

However, directly transferring it to magnetic resonance images faces two key challenges: the inability to adapt to the specificity of medical anatomical structures and the limitations brought about by the privacy and scarcity of medical data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans.

To this end, we propose Moaw, a framework that unleashes motion awareness for video diffusion models and leverages it to facilitate motion transfer. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for motion perception, shifting its modality from image-to-video generation to video-to-dense-tracking. We then construct a motion-labeled dataset to identify features that encode the strongest motion information, and inject them into a structurally identical video generation model.

Focusing on complex continuous environments, we categorize key perceptual bottlenecks into three spatial challenges: door interaction,multi-room navigation, and ambiguous instruction execution, where existing methods consistently suffer high failure rates. We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations. Building on this foundation, our Explored Multi-expert Reasoning (EMR) module uses parallel LLM experts to address waypoint-level semantics and region-level spatial transitions. When discrepancies arise between expert predictions, a query-and-explore mechanism is activated, prompting the agent to actively probe critical areas and resolve perceptual ambiguities. Experiments on VLN-CE demonstrate that Spatial VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance using only low-cost LLMs. Furthermore, to validate real-world applicability, we introduce a value-based waypoint sampling strategy that effectively bridges the Sim2Real gap.

Our approach progressively distills salient visual concepts from raw patch-tokens at different semantic levels, mitigating redundancy while preserving crucial details for alignment.

In this work, we propose a new framework to tackle the novel setting of one-shot 3D full-head animatable avatar reconstruction in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time animation and simultaneous 360$^\\circ$ rendering views. To facilitate efficient animation control, we model 3D head avatars with Gaussian primitives embedded on the surface of a parametric face model within the UV space. To obtain knowledge of full-head geometry and textures, we leverage rich 3D full-head priors within a pretrained 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) for global full-head feature extraction and multi-view supervision. To increase the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction of the input image, we take advantage of the symmetric nature of the UV space and human faces to fuse local fine-grained input image features with the global full-head textures.

The challenge is that a panoptic segmentation system trained on a particular dataset typically does not generalize well to unseen classes beyond the training data. In this work, we propose RetCLIP, a retrieval-augmented panoptic segmentation method that improves the performance of unseen classes. In particular, we construct a masked segment feature database using paired image-text data. At inference time, we use masked segment features from the input image as query keys to retrieve similar features and associated class labels from the database. Classification scores for the masked segment are assigned based on the similarity between query features and retrieved features. The retrieval-based classification scores are combined with CLIP-based scores to produce the final output. We incorporate our solution with a previous SOTA method (FC-CLIP).

Although Deep Learning (DL) effectively identifies basic interference, classifying compound interference remains difficult due to the superposition of diverse jamming sources. Existing single-domain approaches often suffer from performance degradation because transient burst signals and continuous global signals require conflicting feature extraction scales. We propose the Selective Kernel and Asymmetric convolution Network(SKANet), a cognitive deep learning framework built upon a dual-stream architecture that integrates Time-Frequency Images (TFIs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Distinct from conventional fusion methods that rely on static receptive fields, the proposed architecture incorporates a Multi-Branch Selective Kernel (SK) module combined with Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACBs). This mechanism enables the network to dynamically adjust its receptive fields, acting as an adaptive filter that simultaneously captures micro-scale transient features and macro-scale spectral trends within entangled compound signals. To complement this spatial-temporal adaptation, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism is integrated at the fusion stage to adaptively recalibrate the contribution of heterogeneous features from each modality.

Deep networks are vulnerable to such label-corrupted samples due to the memorization effect. One major stream of previous methods concentrates on identifying clean data for training. However, these methods often neglect imbalances in label noise across different mini-batches and devote insufficient attention to out-of-distribution noisy data. To this end, we propose a noise-robust method named Jo-SNC (\\textbf{Jo}int sample selection and model regularization based on \\textbf{S}elf- and \\textbf{N}eighbor-\\textbf{C}onsistency). Specifically, we propose to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the ``likelihood'' of a sample being clean or out-of-distribution. This process factors in the nearest neighbors of each sample to reinforce the reliability of clean sample identification. We design a self-adaptive, data-driven thresholding scheme to adjust per-class selection thresholds.

Although deep learning has advanced interference recognition, current static models suffer from a \\textbf{fundamental limitation}: they impose a fixed computational topology regardless of the input's physical entropy. This rigidity leads to severe resource mismatch, where simple primitives consume the same processing cost as chaotic, saturated mixtures. To resolve this, this paper introduces PhyG-MoE (Physics-Guided Mixture-of-Experts), a framework designed to \\textbf{dynamically align model capacity with signal complexity}. Unlike static architectures, the proposed system employs a spectrum-based gating mechanism that routes signals based on their spectral feature entanglement. A high-capacity TransNeXt expert is activated on-demand to disentangle complex features in saturated scenarios, while lightweight experts handle fundamental signals to minimize latency. Evaluations on 21 jamming categories demonstrate that PhyG-MoE achieves an overall accuracy of 97.58\\%.

Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination.

Inspired by recent advances in rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression, this work integrates semantic learning into the compression pipeline to support decoder-side applications--such as scene editing and manipulation--that extend beyond traditional scene reconstruction and view synthesis. Our scheme features a lightweight implicit neural representation-based hyperprior, enabling efficient entropy coding of both color and semantic attributes while avoiding costly grid-based hyperprior as seen in many prior works. To facilitate compression and segmentation, we further develop compression-guided segmentation learning, consisting of quantization-aware training to enhance feature separability and a quality-aware weighting mechanism to suppress unreliable Gaussian primitives.

We introduce SDF-HOLO (Systemic Dual-stream Fusion Holo Model), a multimodal foundation model for holistic total-body PET/CT, pre-trained on more than 10,000 patients. SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning. To model long-range dependencies across the body, hierarchical context modeling combines efficient local windows with global attention. To bridge voxels and clinical language, we use anatomical segmentation masks as explicit semantic anchors and perform voxel-mask-text alignment during pre-training. Across tumor segmentation, low-dose lesion detection, and multilingual diagnostic report generation, SDF-HOLO outperforms strong task-specific and clinical-reference baselines while reducing localization errors and hallucinated findings.

Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM-MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. We then estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE), demonstrating that densified splat-based geometry can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement.", "AI": {"tldr": "TreeDGS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u6811\u5e72\u76f4\u5f84\uff08DBH\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d85\u8d8aLiDAR\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u4e2d\u9065\u611f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6811\u5e72\u76f4\u5f84\uff08DBH\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982NeRF\u548c3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff09\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "TreeDGS\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u53ef\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SfM-MVS\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RaDe-GS\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u63d0\u53d6\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u5fc3\u5706\u62df\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1DBH\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u5730\u5757\u7684\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u91cfDBH\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cTreeDGS\u8fbe\u52304.79\u5398\u7c73\u7684RMSE\uff08\u7ea62.6\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LiDAR\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff087.91\u5398\u7c73RMSE\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "TreeDGS\u901a\u8fc73D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7a7a\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6811\u5e72\u76f4\u5f84\uff08DBH\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684LiDAR\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite their popularity, the faithfulness and reliability of these heatmap-based explanations remain under scrutiny. This study critically investigates whether Grad-CAM truly represents the internal decision-making of deep models trained for lung cancer image classification. Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful.

However, in challenging scenarios such as large pose variations, illumination changes, and facial expression variations, they still struggle to accurately capture the geometric structure of the face, resulting in performance degradation. Moreover, the limited size and diversity of existing FLD datasets hinder robust model training, leading to reduced detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a Frequency-Guided Task-Balancing Transformer (FGTBT), which enhances facial structure perception through frequency-domain modeling and multi-dataset unified training. Specifically, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Multi-Task Balancing loss (FMB-loss), which moves beyond coarse task-level balancing by assigning weights to individual landmarks based on their occurrence across datasets. This enables more effective unified training and mitigates the issue of inconsistent gradient magnitudes.

However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method.

Capitalizing on the advanced capabilities of audio-driven talking head generation (AD-THG) models in synthesizing precise lip movements, our research introduces a novel integration of these models with SPFEM. We present a new framework, Talking Head Facial Expression Manipulation (THFEM), which utilizes AD-THG models to generate frames with accurately synchronized lip movements from audio inputs and SPFEM-altered images. However, increasing the number of frames generated by AD-THG models tends to compromise the realism and expression fidelity of the images. To counter this, we develop an adjacent frame learning strategy that finetunes AD-THG models to predict sequences of consecutive frames. This strategy enables the models to incorporate information from neighboring frames, significantly improving image quality during testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this framework effectively preserves mouth shapes during expression manipulations, highlighting the substantial benefits of integrating AD-THG with SPFEM.", "AI": {"tldr": "THFEM\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408AD-THG\u4e0eSPFEM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SPFEM\u5728\u8868\u60c5\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e2d\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528AD-THG\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTHFEM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AD-THG\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eTHFEM\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u60c5\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e2d\u7684\u53e3\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408AD-THG\u4e0eSPFEM\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684THFEM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408AD-THG\u4e0eSPFEM\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u60c5\u64cd\u7eb5\u4e2d\u53e3\u578b\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u90bb\u5e27\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, low-resolution face images or the compression (via pooling or strided convolution) of originally high-resolution images hinder the learning of such features, thereby reducing FLD accuracy. Moreover, insufficient training data and imprecise annotations further degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised framework called Supervision-by-Hallucination-and-Transfer (SHT) for more robust and precise FLD. SHT contains two novel mutually enhanced modules: Dual Hallucination Learning Network (DHLN) and Facial Pose Transfer Network (FPTN). By incorporating FLD and face hallucination tasks, DHLN is able to learn high-resolution representations with low-resolution inputs for recovering both facial structures and local details and generating more effective landmark heatmaps. Then, by transforming faces from one pose to another, FPTN can further improve landmark heatmaps and faces hallucinated by DHLN for detecting more accurate landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore weakly-supervised FLD by integrating face hallucination and facial pose transfer tasks.

Most methods assume a fixed slot count K, and to better accommodate the dynamic nature of object cardinality, a few works have explored K-adaptive variants. However, existing K-adaptive methods still suffer from two limitations. First, they do not explicitly constrain slot-binding quality, so low-quality slots lead to ambiguous feature attribution. Second, adding a slot-count penalty to the reconstruction objective creates conflicting optimization goals between reducing the number of active slots and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a result, they still lag significantly behind strong K-fixed baselines. To address these challenges, we propose Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention (QASA). First, we decouple slot selection from reconstruction, eliminating the mutual constraints between the two objectives. Then, we propose an unsupervised Slot-Quality metric to assess per-slot quality, providing a principled signal for fine-grained slot--object binding. Based on this metric, we design a Quality-Guided Slot Selection scheme that dynamically selects a subset of high-quality slots and feeds them into our newly designed gated decoder for reconstruction during training.

On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \\textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \\textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \\emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \\textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Specifically, we condition the denoising process on the 2D pose, the surroundings of the subject, and the context of the scene. With GazeD we also introduce a novel way of representing the 3D gaze by positioning it as an additional body joint at a fixed distance from the eyes. The rationale is that the gaze is usually closely related to the pose, and thus it can benefit from being jointly denoised during the diffusion process.

However, their robustness to real-world weather conditions, and the stability of cross-modal semantic alignment under such structured perturbations, remain insufficiently studied. In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u96e8\u5929\u653b\u51fbVLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u96e8\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76VLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5bf9\u96e8\u5929\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u964d\u96e8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f31\u5316\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u96e8\u6ef4\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u964d\u96e8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7167\u660e\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5929\u6c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u6d41VLMs\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u7167\u660e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u96e8\u6ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6297\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

By processing patients` longitudinal health records and bone-related tabular data, our model captures complex, long-range dependencies in disease progression that conventional methods often overlook. We validated our TabTrans model on a retrospective Qatar BioBank (QBB) cohort of 1,382 subjects, comprising 725 men (146 diabetic, 579 healthy) and 657 women (133 diabetic, 524 healthy). The study integrated electronic health records (EHR) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data. To address class imbalance, we employed SMOTE and SMOTE-ENN resampling techniques. The proposed model`s performance is evaluated against conventional machine learning (ML) and generative AI models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic`s constitutional AI), GPT-4 (OpenAI`s generative pre-trained transformer), and Gemini Pro (Google`s multimodal language model). Our TabTrans model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving ROC AUC $\\geq$ 79.7 % for T2DM prediction compared to both generative AI models and conventional ML approaches. Feature interpretation analysis identified key risk indicators, with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume, ward bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC), T and Z-scores, and L1-L4 scores emerging as the most important predictors associated with diabetes development in Qatari adults. These findings demonstrate the significant potential of TabTrans for analyzing complex tabular healthcare data, providing a powerful tool for proactive T2DM management and personalized clinical interventions in the Qatari population.\n  Index Terms: tabular transformers, multimodal data, DXA data, diabetes, T2DM, feature interpretation, tabular data", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faTabTrans\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528tabular transformer\uff08TabTrans\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9aa8\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SMOTE\u548cSMOTE-ENN\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "TabTrans\u6a21\u578b\u5728T2DM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cROC AUC \u2265 79.7%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5185\u810f\u8102\u80aa\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff08VAT\uff09\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u9aa8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08BMD\uff09\u548c\u9aa8\u77ff\u7269\u8d28\u542b\u91cf\uff08BMC\uff09\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86TabTrans\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u65e9\u671f2\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5361\u5854\u5c14\u4eba\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Study-level CT triage requires calibrated predictions with localized evidence; however, off-the-shelf Vision Language Models (VLM) struggle with 3D anatomy, protocol shifts, and noisy report supervision. This study used the two largest publicly available chest CT datasets: CT-RATE and RADCHEST-CT (held-out external test set). Our carefully tuned supervised baseline (instantiated as a simple Global Average Pooling head) establishes a new supervised state of the art, surpassing all reported linear-probe VLMs. Building on this baseline, we present ORACLE-CT, an encoder-agnostic, organ-aware head that pairs Organ-Masked Attention (mask-restricted, per-organ pooling that yields spatial evidence) with Organ-Scalar Fusion (lightweight fusion of normalized volume and mean-HU cues). In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85.

P. Kooij"], "title": "AsyncBEV: Cross-modal Flow Alignment in Asynchronous 3D Object Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception tasks like 3D object detection typically rely on well-synchronized sensors, both at training and inference. However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based).

Many image smoothing algorithms rely on computing local window statistics or solving an optimization problem.

Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\\ell_0$ ``norm\", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver.

We introduce Think3D, a framework that enables VLM agents to think with 3D space. By leveraging 3D reconstruction models that recover point clouds and camera poses from images or videos, Think3D allows the agent to actively manipulate space through camera-based operations and ego/global-view switching, transforming spatial reasoning into an interactive 3D chain-of-thought process. Without additional training, Think3D significantly improves the spatial reasoning performance of advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, yielding average gains of +7.8% on BLINK Multi-view and MindCube, and +4.7% on VSI-Bench. We further show that smaller models, which struggle with spatial exploration, benefit significantly from a reinforcement learning policy that enables the model to select informative viewpoints and operations. With RL, the benefit from tool usage increases from +0.7% to +6.8%. Our findings demonstrate that training-free, tool-augmented spatial exploration is a viable path toward more flexible and human-like 3D reasoning in multimodal agents, establishing a new dimension of multimodal intelligence.

Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs.

Pixel-level annotation of low-light crack images is extremely time-consuming, yet most deep learning methods require large, well-illuminated datasets. We propose a dual-branch prototype learning network integrating Retinex theory with few-shot learning for low-light crack segmentation. Retinex-based reflectance components guide illumination-invariant global representation learning, while metric learning reduces dependence on large annotated datasets. We introduce a cross-similarity prior mask generation module that computes high-dimensional similarities between query and support features to capture crack location and structure, and a multi-scale feature enhancement module that fuses multi-scale features with the prior mask to alleviate spatial inconsistency.

Existing algorithmic fairness approaches typically seek to reduce such disparities by suppressing sensitive attributes. However, in medical settings these attributes often carry essential diagnostic information, and removing them can degrade accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications. In contrast, clinical decision making explicitly incorporates patient context when interpreting diagnostic evidence, suggesting a different design direction for subgroup-aware models. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a patient-conditioned adaptation framework that improves subgroup reliability while maintaining a shared diagnostic model. Clinically relevant attributes such as age and sex are encoded into a compact embedding and used to condition a hypernetwork-style module, which generates small residual modulation parameters for selected layers of a shared backbone. This design preserves the general medical knowledge learned by the backbone while enabling targeted adjustments that reflect patient-specific variability.

We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions.

With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process.

We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench.

Based on multi-view captures of a subject, we create an animatable 3D face model and a dynamic 3D body model, both rendered by splatting Gaussian primitives. Once merged together, they represent a lifelike virtual human avatar suitable for real-time user interactions. We equip our avatar with an LLM for conversational ability. During conversation, the audio speech of the avatar is used as a driving signal to animate the face model, enabling precise synchronization. We describe improvements to our dynamic Gaussian models that enhance photorealism: SWinGS++ for body reconstruction and HeadGaS++ for face reconstruction, and provide as well a solution to merge the separate face and body models without artifacts. We also present a demo of the complete system, showcasing several use cases of real-time conversation with the 3D avatar.

It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniOVCD\u5229\u7528SAM 3\u7684SFID\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684OVCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56CLIP\u548c\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DINO\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002SAM 3\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e3aOVCD\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniOVCD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM 3\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1SFID\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u6784\u5efa\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728LEVIR-CD\u3001WHU-CD\u3001S2Looking\u548cSECOND\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cIoU\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a67.2\u300166.5\u300124.5\u548c27.1\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniOVCD\u901a\u8fc7SFID\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e86SAM 3\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u51fa\u5934\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional methods achieve impressive results through large-scale training on massive image corpora. With the emergence of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), recent studies have explored their applications in geo-localization, benefiting from improved accuracy and interpretability. However, existing benchmarks largely ignore the temporal information inherent in images, which can further constrain the location. To bridge this gap, we introduce GTPred, a novel benchmark for geo-temporal prediction. GTPred comprises 370 globally distributed images spanning over 120 years. We evaluate MLLM predictions by jointly considering year and hierarchical location sequence matching, and further assess intermediate reasoning chains using meticulously annotated ground-truth reasoning processes.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning.

The uniqueness of the presented dataset lies in the ethical and safety affiliated challenges that make collecting comparable data in real-world environments highly difficult. \\dataset~ not only features accurate gaze data and a complete state-space representation of objects in the virtual environment, but it also offers variable scenario complexities and rich annotations, including panoptic segmentation, depth information, and vehicle keypoints. We further propose object-based similarity (oSIM) as a novel metric to evaluate the performance of object-based visual attention models, a previously unexplored performance characteristic. Our evaluations show that explicitly optimising for object-based attention not only improves oSIM performance but also leads to an improved model performance on common metrics. In addition, we present SUMGraph, a Mamba U-Net-based model, which explicitly encodes critical scene objects (vehicles) in a graph representation, leading to further performance improvements over several state-of-the-art visual attention prediction methods.

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels.

Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only. The few approaches that have attempted to recognize blended emotions typically cannot assess the relative salience of the emotions within a blend. This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70). Using this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification approaches on two blended emotion prediction tasks: (1) predicting the presence of emotions in a given sample, and (2) predicting the relative salience of emotions in a blend. Our results show that unimodal classifiers achieve up to 29% presence accuracy and 13% salience accuracy on the validation set, while multimodal methods yield clear improvements, with ImageBind + WavLM reaching 35% presence accuracy and HiCMAE 18% salience accuracy. On the held-out test set, the best models achieve 33% presence accuracy (VideoMAEv2 + HuBERT) and 18% salience accuracy (HiCMAE).

Evaluated on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset, ConvMambaNet achieved a 99% accuracy and demonstrated robust performance under severe class imbalance. These results underscore the model's potential for precise and efficient seizure detection, offering a viable path toward real-time, automated epilepsy monitoring in clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConvMambaNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cMamba-SSM\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728CHB-MIT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99%\u3002", "motivation": "\u766b\u75eb\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6162\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u662f\u76d1\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u766b\u75eb\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8eEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bConvMambaNet\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u548cMamba\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CHB-MIT Scalp EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cConvMambaNet\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8699%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ConvMambaNet\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u766b\u75eb\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e3a\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While prior methods improve spatial adherence using 2D cues or iterative copy-warp-paste strategies, they often distort object geometry and fail to preserve consistency across edits. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "POCI-Diff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u3002POCI-Diff\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u5e03\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6POCI-Diff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Blended Latent Diffusion\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u7279\u5b9a3D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528IP-Adapter\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPOCI-Diff\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "POCI-Diff \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54083D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to address the uVCIL. We first consider a deep feature extractor network, providing a set of representative video features during each task without assuming any class or task information. We then progressively build a series of deep clusters from the extracted features. During the successive task learning, the model updated from the previous task is used as an initial state in order to transfer knowledge to the current learning task. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, by ignoring the labels from the supervised setting.

While valuable for recognition, such datasets cannot assess the full visual understanding, language grounding, and clinical reasoning capabilities of multimodal models. Visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks are required to evaluate how models interpret dermatological images, reason over fine-grained morphology, and generate clinically meaningful descriptions. We introduce DermaBench, a clinician-annotated dermatology VQA benchmark built on the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset. DermaBench comprises 656 clinical images from 570 unique patients spanning Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI. Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations.

We call this ability Causal Spatial Reasoning. However, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) cannot do this, as they remain largely restricted to static spatial perception, struggling to answer \"what-if\" questions in a 3D scene. We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors.

Despite recent advances, existing methods often lack effective integration of histological morphology with molecular profiles, relying on shallow fusion strategies or omitting tissue images altogether, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous spatial domain boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose MultiST, a unified multimodal framework that jointly models spatial topology, gene expression, and tissue morphology through cross-attention-based fusion. MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries.

The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u9762\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u5230\u7403\u4f53\u4e0a\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u9762\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9876\u70b9\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7403\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u53f7\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u5747\u5300\u7684\u7403\u9762\u5750\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u7403\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c063D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7403\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7403\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7403\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Elevation resolved 4D mmWave radar offers strong resilience to such conditions, yet there remains a limited understanding of how to process its sparse and anisotropic point clouds for reliable human detection in enclosed, visibility degraded spaces. This paper presents a fully model-driven 4D radar perception framework designed for real-time execution on embedded edge hardware. The system uses radar as its sole perception modality and integrates domain aware multi threshold filtering, ego motion compensated temporal accumulation, KD tree Euclidean clustering with Doppler aware refinement, and a rule based 3D classifier. The framework is evaluated in a dust filled enclosed trailer and in real underground mining tunnels, and in the tested scenarios the radar based detector maintains stable pedestrian identification as camera and LiDAR modalities fail under severe visibility degradation. These results suggest that the proposed model-driven approach provides robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient perception for safety-critical applications in harsh industrial and subterranean environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u76844D\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6076\u52a3\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cLiDAR\u5931\u6548\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u53ca\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7c89\u5c18\u3001\u70df\u96fe\u3001\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u548cLiDAR\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u800c4D\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9608\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u8fd0\u52a8\u8865\u507f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u3001KD\u6811\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u76843D\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7c89\u5c18\u5145\u65a5\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u62d6\u8f66\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u9053\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cLiDAR\u56e0\u4e25\u91cd\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5931\u6548\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u884c\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a84D\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5de5\u4e1a\u53ca\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Trained for denoising and generation without labels, they can be interpreted as self-supervised learners that capture both low- and high-level structure. We show that a frozen diffusion backbone enables strong fine-grained recognition by probing intermediate denoising features across layers and timesteps and training a linear classifier for each pair.

Recent GAN- and diffusion-based enhancement methods improve perceptual quality by aligning degraded images with high-quality distributions, but our analysis shows that this focus can distort intra-class geometry: clinically related samples become dispersed, disease-class boundaries blur, and downstream tasks such as grading or lesion detection are harmed. The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy offers a principled solution by aligning distributions through internal pairwise distances, naturally preserving intra-class structure, but its high computational cost restricts practical use. To overcome this, we propose SGW-GAN, the first framework to incorporate Sliced GW (SGW) into retinal image enhancement.

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of VLM-based approaches for anomaly classification (AC) and anomaly segmentation (AS). We systematically investigate key architectural paradigms including sliding window-based dense feature extraction (WinCLIP), multi-stage feature alignment with learnable projections (AprilLab framework), and compositional prompt ensemble strategies. Our analysis evaluates these methods across critical dimensions: feature extraction mechanisms, text-visual alignment strategies, prompt engineering techniques, zero-shot versus few-shot trade-offs, computational efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Through rigorous experimentation on benchmarks such as MVTec AD and VisA, we compare classification accuracy, segmentation precision, and inference efficiency.

The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case.

To bridge this gap, we propose ChartVerse, a scalable framework designed to synthesize complex charts and reliable reasoning data from scratch.

Guided by RPE, we develop complexity-aware chart coder to autonomously synthesize diverse, high-complexity charts via executable programs.

Diverging from standard generation, we adopt an answer-first paradigm: we extract deterministic answers directly from the source code, generate questions conditional on these anchors, and enforce strict consistency verification. To further elevate difficulty and reasoning depth, we filter samples based on model fail-rate and distill high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

Previous state-of-the-art grounding visual language models usually have large model sizes, making them heavy for deployment and slow for inference. However, we notice that the sizes of visual encoders are nearly the same for small and large VLMs and the major difference is the sizes of the language models. Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects.

Previous work achieved this with loss functions. Recent advancements in classification have shown that the discriminative ability of embeddings can be strengthened by imposing maximum class separation as inductive bias. This technique has never been used in the domain of face-voice association, and this work aims at filling this gap. More specifically, we develop a method for face-voice association that imposes maximum class separation among multimodal representations of different speakers as an inductive bias. Through quantitative experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it achieves SOTA performance on two task formulation of face-voice association. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study to show that imposing inductive bias is most effective when combined with losses for inter-class orthogonality.

Yet, existing AL methods are unable to consistently outperform improved random sampling baselines adapted to 3D data, leaving the field without a reliable solution. We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning.

To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements.

Under review", "summary": "High-fidelity parking-lot digital twins provide essential priors for path planning, collision checking, and perception validation in Automated Valet Parking (AVP). Yet robot-oriented reconstruction faces a trilemma: sparse forward-facing views cause weak parallax and ill-posed geometry; dynamic occlusions and extreme lighting hinder stable texture fusion; and neural rendering typically needs expensive offline optimization, violating edge-side streaming constraints. We propose ParkingTwin, a training-free, lightweight system for online streaming 3D reconstruction. First, OSM-prior-driven geometric construction uses OpenStreetMap semantic topology to directly generate a metric-consistent TSDF, replacing blind geometric search with deterministic mapping and avoiding costly optimization. Second, geometry-aware dynamic filtering employs a quad-modal constraint field (normal/height/depth consistency) to reject moving vehicles and transient occlusions in real time. Third, illumination-robust fusion in CIELAB decouples luminance and chromaticity via adaptive L-channel weighting and depth-gradient suppression, reducing seams under abrupt lighting changes. ParkingTwin runs at 30+ FPS on an entry-level GTX 1660. On a 68,000 m^2 real-world dataset, it achieves SSIM 0.87 (+16.0%), delivers about 15x end-to-end speedup, and reduces GPU memory by 83.3% compared with state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that typically requires high-end GPUs (RTX 4090D). The system outputs explicit triangle meshes compatible with Unity/Unreal digital-twin pipelines.

It contians 9 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Glass surface ubiquitous in both daily life and professional environments presents a potential threat to vision-based systems, such as robot and drone navigation. To solve this challenge, most recent studies have shown significant interest in Video Glass Surface Detection (VGSD). We observe that objects in the reflection (or transmission) layer appear farther from the glass surfaces. Consequently, in video motion scenarios, the notable reflected (or transmitted) objects on the glass surface move slower than objects in non-glass regions within the same spatial plane, and this motion inconsistency can effectively reveal the presence of glass surfaces. Based on this observation, we propose a novel network, named MVGD-Net, for detecting glass surfaces in videos by leveraging motion inconsistency cues. Our MVGD-Net features three novel modules: the Cross-scale Multimodal Fusion Module (CMFM) that integrates extracted spatial features and estimated optical flow maps, the History Guided Attention Module (HGAM) and Temporal Cross Attention Module (TCAM), both of which further enhances temporal features.

However, existing methods fail to explicitly align their receptive fields with the 3D facial surface-the spatial support of the rPPG signal. To address this, we propose the Facial Spatiotemporal Graph (STGraph), a novel representation that encodes facial color and structure using 3D facial mesh sequences-enabling surface-aligned spatiotemporal processing. We introduce MeshPhys, a lightweight spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that operates on the STGraph to estimate physiological signals. Across four benchmark datasets, MeshPhys achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance in both intra- and cross-dataset settings. Ablation studies show that constraining the model's receptive field to the facial surface acts as a strong structural prior, and that surface-aligned, 3D-aware node features are critical for robustly encoding facial surface color. Together, the STGraph and MeshPhys constitute a novel, principled modeling paradigm for facial rPPG, enabling robust, interpretable, and generalizable estimation.

Current methods typically rely on extensive multi-view capture setups or monocular videos with per-identity optimization during inference, limiting their scalability and ease of use on unseen subjects. To overcome these efficiency drawbacks, we propose \\OURS, a feed-forward method to generate high-quality Gaussian head avatars from only a few input images while supporting real-time animation. Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes. Furthermore, to enhance geometric smoothness of the 3D head, we employ point maps from a pre-trained large reconstruction model as geometry supervision. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both rendering quality and inference efficiency, while supporting real-time dynamic avatar animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba13D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5934\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5934\u50cf\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u6216\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u9988\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u805a\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u9884\u6d4b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u3002"}}

While Visual Question Answering (VQA) has shown strong performance in general-purpose domains, its suitability for the complex and safety-critical reasoning required in disaster response remains unclear. We introduce DisasterVQA, a benchmark dataset designed for perception and reasoning in crisis contexts. DisasterVQA consists of 1,395 real-world images and 4,405 expert-curated question-answer pairs spanning diverse events such as floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. Grounded in humanitarian frameworks including FEMA ESF and OCHA MIRA, the dataset includes binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended questions covering situational awareness and operational decision-making tasks. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art vision-language models and find performance variability across question types, disaster categories, regions, and humanitarian tasks. Although models achieve high accuracy on binary questions, they struggle with fine-grained quantitative reasoning, object counting, and context-sensitive interpretation, particularly for underrepresented disaster scenarios.

Due to its practical importance, CAC has received increasing attention in recent years. Most existing methods assume a single object class per image, rely on extensive training of large deep learning models and address the problem by incorporating additional information, such as visual exemplars or text prompts. In this paper, we present OCCAM, the first training-free approach to CAC that operates without the need of any supplementary information. Moreover, our approach addresses the multi-class variant of the problem, as it is capable of counting the object instances in each and every class among arbitrary object classes within an image.

In this work, we consider the monocular setting, i.e. single-view input, for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Here, the task is to predict a 3D point set of human skeletal joints from a single 2D input image. While by definition this is an ill-posed problem, recent work has presented methods that solve it with up to several-centimetre error. Typically, these methods employ a two-step approach, where the first step is to detect the 2D skeletal joints in the input image, followed by the step of 2D-to-3D lifting. We find that common lifting models fail when encountering a rotated input. We argue that learning a single human pose along with its in-plane rotations is considerably easier and more geometrically grounded than directly learning a point-to-point mapping. Furthermore, our intuition is that endowing the model with the notion of rotation equivariance without explicitly constraining its parameter space should lead to a more straightforward learning process than one with equivariance by design. Utilising the common HPE benchmarks, we confirm that the 2D rotation equivariance per se improves the model performance on human poses akin to rotations in the image plane, and can be efficiently and straightforwardly learned by augmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art equivariant-by-design methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e602D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u89c6\u56fe3D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u89c6\u56fe3D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f93\u5165\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6620\u5c04\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u66f4\u7262\u56fa\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u68c0\u6d4b2D\u9aa8\u9abc\u5173\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c2D\u52303D\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e602D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u89c6\u56fe3D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability.

Existing evaluation metrics primarily focus on perceptual quality or reconstruction fidelity, and are not designed to assess whether a set of sampled frames adequately captures informative and representative video content.\n  We propose Spatio-Temporal Entropy Coverage (STEC), a simple and non-reference metric for evaluating the effectiveness of video frame sampling. STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality.\n  Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding.\n  We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "STEC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u71b5\u8986\u76d6\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6563\u548c\u975e\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u6837\u5e27\u662f\u5426\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "STEC\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e27\u71b5\uff08STFE\uff09\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u57fa\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bcf\u5e27\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u65f6\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u6837\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSR-VTT test-1k\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSTEC\u660e\u663e\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "STEC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002"}}

Yet existing detection solutions often exhibit a pronounced deployment gap, with performance degrading sharply when transferred to new sites. This work establishes the foundational detection layer for a multi-year invasive species monitoring initiative targeting Arctic and Atlantic marine ecosystems. We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic \"Context Collapse\" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring.

By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Their impressive generative capability allows them to approximate sampling from a prior distribution, which alongside a known likelihood function permits posterior sampling without retraining the model. While recent methods have made strides in advancing the accuracy of posterior sampling, the majority focuses on single-image inverse problems. However, for modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is common to acquire multiple complementary measurements, each low-resolution along a different axis. In this work, we generalize common diffusion-based inverse single-image problem solvers for multi-image super-resolution (MISR) MRI. We show that the DPS likelihood correction allows an exactly-separable gradient decomposition across independently acquired measurements, enabling MISR without constructing a joint operator, modifying the diffusion model, or increasing network function evaluations. We derive MISR versions of DPS, DMAP, DPPS, and diffusion-based PnP/ADMM, and demonstrate substantial gains over SISR across $4\\times/8\\times/16\\times$ anisotropic degradations.

These vehicles are typically equipped with active sensors, such as LiDAR, which scan the environment in predefined patterns. 3D box annotation based on data from such sensors is challenging in dynamic scenarios, where objects are observed at different timestamps, hence different positions. Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected. Finally, we test the impact of the errors in benchmarking and find that the impact is larger than the improvements that state-of-the-art methods typically achieve with respect to the previous state-of-the-art methods; showing that accurate annotations are essential for correct interpretation of performance.

Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients.

Existing ZS-CIR methods often struggle to capture fine-grained changes and integrate visual and semantic information effectively. They primarily rely on either transforming the multimodal query into a single text using image-to-text models or employing large language models for target image description generation, approaches that often fail to capture complementary visual information and complete semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval method with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration (CVSI). Specifically, CVSI leverages three key components: (1) Visual Information Extraction, which not only extracts global image features but also uses a pre-trained mapping network to convert the image into a pseudo token, combining it with the modification text and the objects most likely to be added. (2) Semantic Information Extraction, which involves using a pre-trained captioning model to generate multiple captions for the reference image, followed by leveraging an LLM to generate the modified captions and the objects most likely to be added.

However, enumeration anomalies may result in individuals having eleven or thirteen thoracic vertebrae and four or six lumbar vertebrae. Although the identification of enumeration anomalies has potential clinical implications for chronic back pain and operation planning, the thoracolumbar junction is often poorly assessed and rarely described in clinical reports. Additionally, even though multiple deep-learning-based vertebra labeling algorithms exist, there is a lack of methods to automatically label enumeration anomalies. Our work closes that gap by introducing \"Vertebra Identification with Anomaly Handling\" (VERIDAH), a novel vertebra labeling algorithm based on multiple classification heads combined with a weighted vertebra sequence prediction algorithm. We show that our approach surpasses existing models on T2w TSE sagittal (98.30% vs. 94.24% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p < 0.001) and CT imaging (99.18% vs. 77.26% of subjects with all vertebrae correctly labeled, p < 0.001) and works in arbitrary field-of-view images.

Most existing datasets are captured from ground-level perspectives, and models trained on them often struggle to transfer to drastically different domains such as aerial views. This paper examines how curriculum-based training strategies can improve generalization to unseen real aerial-view data without using any real aerial data during training.\n  We explore curriculum learning for cross-view action recognition using two out-of-domain sources: synthetic aerial-view data and real ground-view data. Our results on the evaluation on order of training (fine-tuning on synthetic aerial data vs. real ground data) shows that fine-tuning on real ground data but differ in how they transition from synthetic to real. The first uses a two-stage curriculum with direct fine-tuning, while the second applies a progressive curriculum that expands the dataset in multiple stages before fine-tuning. We evaluate both methods on the REMAG dataset using SlowFast (CNN-based) and MViTv2 (Transformer-based) architectures.\n  Results show that combining the two out-of-domain datasets clearly outperforms training on a single domain, whether real ground-view or synthetic aerial-view. Both curriculum strategies match the top-1 accuracy of simple dataset combination while offering efficiency gains. With the two-step fine-tuning method, SlowFast achieves up to a 37% reduction in iterations and MViTv2 up to a 30% reduction compared to simple combination. The multi-step progressive approach further reduces iterations, by up to 9% for SlowFast and 30% for MViTv2, relative to the two-step method.

This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process. To address this, we propose Interp3D, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. Starting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structured Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion. For comprehensive evaluations, we construct a dedicated dataset, Interp3DData, with graded difficulty levels and assess generation results from fidelity, transition smoothness, and plausibility. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods.

Semantic-based methods alleviate this by introducing coarse class-level information, but they are mostly applied on the support side, leaving query representations unchanged. In this paper, we present PMCE, a Probabilistic few-shot framework that leverages Multi-granularity semantics with Caption-guided Enhancement. PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions. Experiments on four benchmarks show that PMCE consistently improves over strong baselines, achieving up to 7.71% absolute gain over the strongest semantic competitor on MiniImageNet in the 1-shot setting.

We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which consists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints.

While ViT-based pipelines offer strong geometric priors, they are often constrained by low-resolution inputs due to computational costs. Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details.

A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is generated by sequentially acquiring 1D depth-resolved raw A-scans (A-line) along the lateral axis (B-line), followed by Doppler phase-subtraction analysis. To ensure high-fidelity B-scan images, current practices rely on dense sampling, which prolongs scanning time, increases storage demands, and limits the capture of rapid blood flow dynamics. Recent studies have explored sparse sampling of raw A-scans to alleviate these limitations, but their effectiveness is hindered by the conservative sampling rates and the uniform modeling of flow and background signals. In this study, we introduce a novel blood flow-aware network, named ASBA (A-line ROI State space model and B-line phase Attention), to reconstruct ODT images from highly sparsely sampled raw A-scans. Specifically, we propose an A-line ROI state space model to extract sparsely distributed flow features along the A-line, and a B-line phase attention to capture long-range flow signals along each B-line based on phase difference. Moreover, we introduce a flow-aware weighted loss function that encourages the network to prioritize the accurate reconstruction of flow signals.

Despite the impressive visual perception capabilities of modern VLMs, we find their performance on ILR unsatisfactory, often dramatically underperforming domain-specific ILR models. This limitation hinders many practical application of VLMs, e.g. where recognizing familiar people and objects is crucial for effective visual understanding. Existing solutions typically learn to recognize instances one at a time using instance-specific datasets, which not only incur substantial data collection and training costs but also struggle with fine-grained discrimination. In this work, we propose IIR-VLM, a VLM enhanced for In-context Instance-level Recognition. We integrate pre-trained ILR expert models as auxiliary visual encoders to provide specialized features for learning diverse instances, which enables VLMs to learn new instances in-context in a one-shot manner. Further, IIR-VLM leverages this knowledge for instance-aware visual understanding. We validate IIR-VLM's efficacy on existing instance personalization benchmarks.

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks.

Motion 3-to-4 addresses these challenges by decomposing 4D synthesis into static 3D shape generation and motion reconstruction. Using a canonical reference mesh, our model learns a compact motion latent representation and predicts per-frame vertex trajectories to recover complete, temporally coherent geometry. A scalable frame-wise transformer further enables robustness to varying sequence lengths.

We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.
