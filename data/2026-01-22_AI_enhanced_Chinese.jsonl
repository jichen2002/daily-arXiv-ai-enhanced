Submitted to the European Journal of Operational Research", "summary": "The Conflict-Driven Cylindrical Algebraic Covering algorithm has proven well suited for performing theory validation checks in the satisfiability modulo theories paradigm for non-linear real arithmetic. CDCAC repurposes the theory underpinning classical cylindrical algebraic decomposition for SMT solving and is implemented in the SMT solvers cvc5 and SMT-RAT, as well as the computer algebra system Maple. It was previously observed that when using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for an SMT theory call, the output can be optimised by solving a single set covering problem instance that minimises the conflict clause. In this paper we consider the corresponding optimisation for CDCAC and observe that CDCAC naturally gives rise to multiple such optimisations within a single call. Each time a covering is generalised in one dimension, the resulting cell in the next dimension is labelled with theory constraints that cannot be satisfied together. We seek the smallest subset of constraints whose union covers all labels from the cells in the current covering. We call this optimisation problem a set covering problem with reasons. To simplify this problem, we introduce a data reduction step that generalises Beasley reduction for the classical set covering problem and show that this step alone solves many of the instances arising from SMT-LIB benchmarks. We then propose an exact solver based on linear programming to efficiently solve the remaining cases. Integrating these techniques into CDCAC has the potential to significantly improve SMT solver performance for non-linear real arithmetic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDCAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u6570\u7b97\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "CDCAC\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u5b50\u53e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff08\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Beasley\u7b80\u5316\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u7b80\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u5355\u72ec\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SMT-LIB\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5269\u4f59\u6848\u4f8b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5230CDCAC\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u6570\u7b97\u672f\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While this paradigm has accumulated a massive body of surrounding literature since its inception in the late '50s, we are still very much in the dark as far as basic computational questions are concerned, perhaps due to the intrinsic complexity of dynamic policies in this context.

Even though this model has generated a vast body of literature over the last six decades, our algorithmic understanding has remained surprisingly limited. Indeed, for general problem instances, the best-known approximation guarantees have remained at a factor of $2$ since the mid-1990s. These guarantees were attained by the now-classic work of Anily [Operations Research, 1991] and Gallego, Queyranne, and Simchi-Levi [Operations Research, 1996] via the highly-structured class of \"stationary order sizes and stationary intervals\" (SOSI) policies, thereby avoiding direct competition against fully dynamic policies.\n  The main contribution of this paper resides in developing new analytical foundations and algorithmic techniques that enable such direct comparisons, leading to the first provable improvement over the $2$-approximation barrier. Leveraging these ideas, we design a constructive approach that allows us to balance cost and capacity at a finer granularity than previously possible via SOSI-based methods. Consequently, given any economic warehouse lot scheduling instance, we present a polynomial-time construction of a random capacity-feasible dynamic policy whose expected long-run average cost is within factor $2-\\frac{17}{5000} + \u03b5$ of optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7a81\u7834\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u6b21\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u76842-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ed3\u5e93\u6279\u6b21\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u4f46\u7b97\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u81ea20\u4e16\u7eaa90\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e2d\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ecd\u505c\u7559\u57282\u500d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6784\u9020\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eSOSI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7ec6\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5e73\u8861\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u9020\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u76842-17/5000 + \u03b5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf92-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u969c\u788d\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6784\u9020\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002"}}

Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

To address these limitations, we introduce the Salient Orientation Symbolic (SOS) script, a programmable symbolic framework for specifying body part orientations and motion timing at keyframes. We further propose an automatic SOS extraction pipeline that employs temporally-constrained agglomerative clustering for frame saliency detection and a Saliency-based Masking Scheme (SMS) to generate sparse, interpretable SOS scripts directly from motion data. Moreover, we present the SOSControl framework, which treats the available orientation symbols in the sparse SOS script as salient and prioritizes satisfying these constraints during motion generation. By incorporating SMS-based data augmentation and gradient-based iterative optimization, the framework enhances alignment with user-specified constraints. Additionally, it employs a ControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE Decoder to ensure smooth and natural motion outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SOS extraction pipeline generates human-interpretable scripts with symbolic annotations at salient keyframes, while the SOSControl framework outperforms existing baselines in motion quality, controllability, and generalizability with respect to motion timing and body part orientation control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SOS\u811a\u672c\u548cSOSControl\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u89c2\u6307\u5b9a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SOS\u811a\u672c\u548cSOSControl\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u52a8SOS\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u548cControlNet-based ACTOR-PAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "SOS\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u811a\u672c\uff0cSOSControl\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SOSControl\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u65b9\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

However, the lack of standardized evaluation models in current literature makes an objective comparison of diverse optimization strategies difficult. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a unified benchmarking framework that standardizes cost catalogs and deployment scenarios. We formulate the network design problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to establish optimality bounds and evaluate three scalable heuristic strategies: a Genetic Algorithm, K-Means Clustering (KMC+), and a graph-based Randomized Successive Splitter Assignment (RSSA+) algorithm. Simulation results show that a time-limited ILP remains a strong reference point, even when optimality is not reached. Despite being rarely used in prior fronthaul planning studies, it consistently yields solutions superior to those produced by standard heuristic methods. Among scalable approaches, RSSA+ reliably attains near-ILP performance while ensuring feasibility across all evaluated scenarios, which underscores the importance of advanced, constraint-aware algorithmic designs over simpler heuristics.

This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation.

While 3D Gaussian Splashing (3D-GS) offers unprecedented rendering speed and quality, current animation techniques often rely on a \"one-size-fits-all\" global tuning approach, where all Gaussian primitives are uniformly driven by a single expression code. This simplistic approach fails to unravel the distinct dynamics of different facial regions, such as deformable skin versus rigid teeth, leading to significant blurring and distortion artifacts. We introduce Conditionally-Adaptive Gaussian Avatars (CAG-Avatar), a framework that resolves this key limitation. At its core is a Conditionally Adaptive Fusion Module built on cross-attention. This mechanism empowers each 3D Gaussian to act as a query, adaptively extracting relevant driving signals from the global expression code based on its canonical position. This \"tailor-made\" conditioning strategy drastically enhances the modeling of fine-grained, localized dynamics. Our experiments confirm a significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity, particularly for challenging regions such as teeth, while preserving real-time rendering performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAG-Avatar\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53473D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u8c10\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u52a8\u753b\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u8c10\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u9762\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0e\u521a\u6027\u7259\u9f7f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u4f5c\u4e3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5176\u89c4\u8303\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u8fbe\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cCAG-Avatar\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7259\u9f7f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CAG-Avatar\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7259\u9f7f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As the platform's popularity continues to grow, it has become a target of choice for recent software supply chain attacks. These attacks exploit excessive permissions, ambiguous versions, or the absence of artifact integrity checks to compromise workflows. In response to these attacks, several security scanners have emerged to help developers harden their workflows.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic comparison of 9 GitHub Actions workflow security scanners. We compare them in terms of scope (which security weaknesses they target), detection capabilities (how many weaknesses they detect), and usability (how long they take to scan a workflow). To compare scanners on a common ground, we first establish a taxonomy of 10 security weaknesses that can occur in GitHub Actions workflows. Then, we run the scanners against a curated set of 596 workflows.\n  Our study reveals that the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow security scanners is diverse, with both broad-scope tools and very focused ones. More importantly, we show that scanners interpret security weaknesses differently, leading to significant differences in the type and number of reported weaknesses. Based on this empirical evidence, we make actionable recommendations for developers to harden their GitHub Actions workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e869\u79cdGitHub Actions\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a0\u56fa\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "GitHub Actions\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb10\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd49\u79cdGitHub Actions\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a0\u56faGitHub Actions\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5b89\u5168\u5f31\u70b9\u65f6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the diverse AMT landscape makes fair comparisons challenging. Task Bench, proposed by Slaughter et al., addresses this challenge through a parameterized framework for evaluating parallel programming systems. This work integrates two recent cluster AMTs, Itoyori and ItoyoriFBC, into Task Bench for comprehensive evaluation against MPI and HPX. Itoyori employs a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model with RDMA-based work stealing, while ItoyoriFBC extends it with futurebased synchronization.\n  We evaluate these systems in terms of both performance and programmer productivity. Performance is assessed across various configurations, including compute-bound kernels, weak scaling, and both imbalanced and communication-intensive patterns. Performance is quantified using application efficiency, i.e., the percentage of maximum performance achieved, and the Minimum Effective Task Granularity (METG), i.e., the smallest task duration before runtime overheads dominate. Programmer productivity is quantified using Lines of Code (LOC) and the Number of Library Constructs (NLC).\n  Our results reveal distinct trade-offs. MPI achieves the highest efficiency for regular, communication-light workloads but requires verbose, lowlevel code. HPX maintains stable efficiency under load imbalance across varying node counts, yet ranks last in productivity metrics, demonstrating that AMTs do not inherently guarantee improved productivity over MPI. Itoyori achieves the highest efficiency in communication-intensive configurations while leading in programmer productivity.

However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff08CMT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5ba2\u670d\u3001\u865a\u62df\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8c03\u6216\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Vision Transformer\u3001Wav2Vec2\u548cBERT\uff09\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u542c\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5229\u7528Kubernetes\u548cTensorFlow Serving\u7684\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEMOCAP\u3001MELD\u548cAffectNet\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.0%\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8612.9%\u3002\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3a128\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8635%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff08CMT\uff09\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e3aAI\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5baa\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u89c1\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u5baa\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u9690\u542b\u3001\u672a\u7ecf\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u653f\u7b56\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u89c4\u8303\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6267\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u6e90\u654f\u611f\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u516b\u9879\u539f\u5219\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51faAI\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u8981\u4e0eAI\u4f26\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

The need for robust, high-fidelity haptic systems is critical for enhancing the precision and reliability of teleoperated surgical tools. Methods: In this study, we present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) designed to improve force rendering by accurately modelling complex tool-tissue interactions. Based on our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA), our novel NIMA method includes nonlinear dynamics to capture and render tool-tissue forces effectively. Results: NIMA improves force feedback accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 (SD 0.02) N, achieving a 95% reduction in MAE compared to IMA. Furthermore, NIMA effectively eliminates haptic \"kickback\" by ensuring no force is applied by the haptic device to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and user comfort. Conclusion: NIMA's ability to account for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions provides an improvement in force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions.

However, their operational efficiency and resource consumption remain poorly understood, hindering practical adoption due to unpredictable costs and environmental impact. To address this, we conduct an analysis of token consumption patterns in an LLM-MA system within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), aiming to understand where tokens are consumed across distinct software engineering activities. We analyze execution traces from 30 software development tasks performed by the ChatDev framework using a GPT-5 reasoning model, mapping its internal phases to distinct development stages (Design, Coding, Code Completion, Code Review, Testing, and Documentation) to create a standardized evaluation framework. We then quantify and compare token distribution (input, output, reasoning) across these stages.\n  Our preliminary findings show that the iterative Code Review stage accounts for the majority of token consumption for an average of 59.4% of tokens. Furthermore, we observe that input tokens consistently constitute the largest share of consumption for an average of 53.9%, providing empirical evidence for potentially significant inefficiencies in agentic collaboration. Our results suggest that the primary cost of agentic software engineering lies not in initial code generation but in automated refinement and verification. Our novel methodology can help practitioners predict expenses and optimize workflows, and it directs future research toward developing more token-efficient agent collaboration protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM-MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u9636\u6bb5\u6d88\u8017\u6700\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\uff0859.4%\uff09\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u5360\u6bd4\u6700\u9ad8\uff0853.9%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u672c\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "LLM-MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u963b\u788d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790SDLC\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86ChatDev\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528GPT-5\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u768430\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u9636\u6bb5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6587\u6863\uff09\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u5e73\u574759.4%\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u5e73\u5747\u536053.9%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u975e\u521d\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9884\u6d4b\u8d39\u7528\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

We then present a novel randomized scheduling algorithm, ROSS, that achieves a provably optimal competitive ratio of $\\sqrt{K}$ under reasonable deadlines, significantly improving upon existing approaches.

However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

Vidal", "Vicent Pla"], "title": "Economic feasibility of virtual operators in 5G via network slicing", "comment": null, "summary": "The provision of services by more than one operator over a common network infrastructure, as enabled by 5G network slicing, is analyzed. Two business models to be implemented by a network operator, who owns the network, and a virtual operator, who does not, are proposed. In one business model, named \\emph{strategic}, the network operator provides service to its user base and the virtual operator provides service to its user base and pays a per-subscriber fee to the network operator. In the other business model, named \\emph{monopolistic}, the network operator provides service to both user bases. The two proposals are analyzed by means of a model that captures both system and economic features. As regards the systems features, the slicing of the network is modeled by means of a Discriminatory Processor Sharing queue. As regards the economic features, the incentives are modeled by means of the user utilities and the operators' revenues; and game theory is used to model the strategic interaction between the users' subscription decision and the operators' pricing decision. In both business models, it is shown that the network operator can be provided with the appropriate economic incentives so that it acquiesces in serving the virtual operator's user base (monopolistic model) and in allowing the virtual operator to provide service over the network operator's infrastructure (strategic model). From the point of view of the users, the strategic model results in a higher subscription rate than the monopolistic model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e865G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u4e0b\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u660e\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8ba2\u9605\u7387\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u67905G\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5784\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5171\u4eab\u961f\u5217\u6a21\u62df\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6536\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u8ba2\u9605\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5b9a\u4ef7\u51b3\u7b56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6218\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u90fd\u80fd\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u613f\u610f\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8ba2\u9605\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6fc0\u52b1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u540c\u610f\u5728\u5784\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5141\u8bb8\u865a\u62df\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5728\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u5784\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba2\u9605\u7387\u3002"}}

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale.

From a single partial observation, multiple incompatible 3D completions may be plausible, causing grasps that appear feasible on one completion to fail on another. We propose an uncertainty-aware grasping pipeline for partially occluded strawberries that explicitly models completion uncertainty arising from both occlusion and learned shape reconstruction. Our approach uses point cloud completion with Monte Carlo dropout to sample multiple shape hypotheses, generates candidate grasps for each completion, and evaluates grasp feasibility using physically grounded force-closure-based metrics. Rather than selecting a grasp based on a single estimate, we aggregate feasibility across completions and apply a conservative lower confidence bound (LCB) criterion to decide whether a grasp should be attempted or safely abstained. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and on a physical robot across increasing levels of synthetic and real leaf occlusion. Results show that uncertainty-aware decision making enables reliable abstention from high-risk grasp attempts under severe occlusion while maintaining robust grasp execution when geometric confidence is sufficient, outperforming deterministic baselines in both simulated and physical robot experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u906e\u6321\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8349\u8393\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u9ad8\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u8349\u8393\u91c7\u6458\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u8003\u8651\u591a\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bdropout\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u4e2a\u5f62\u72b6\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8865\u5168\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u529b\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6267\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6293\u53d6\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, practical adoption is hindered by mathematical intricacy, hardware constraints, and a lack of sound software engineering processes for QUBO development. This work presents AQUA (Agile QUantum Annealing), an agile lifecycle for QUBO/QA development created through an industry-academia partnership between NetService S.p.A and the University of Cagliari. Using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach, AQUA customizes Scrum to the needs of QUBO/QA development, structuring work into four stages: initial assessment with formal modeling, prototype-driven algorithm selection, agile implementation, and deployment with ongoing maintenance, each gated by milestones. Validated on a real credit-scoring case, AQUA shows feasibility and offers an explicit, systematic QA engineering framework.

Ensuring correctness of RDMA programs has only recently become possible with the formalisation of $\\text{RDMA}^\\text{TSO}$ semantics (describing the behaviour of RDMA networking over a TSO CPU). However, this semantics currently lacks a formalisation of remote synchronisation, meaning that the implementations of common abstractions such as locks cannot be verified. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{TSO}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, the first semantics for remote `read-modify-write' (RMW) instructions over TSO. It turns out that remote RMW operations are weak and only ensure atomicity against other remote RMWs. We therefore build a set of composable synchronisation abstractions starting with the $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$ library. Underpinned by $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{WAIT}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, we then specify, implement and verify three classes of remote locks that are suitable for different scenarios. Additionally, we develop the notion of a strong RDMA model, $\\text{RDMA}^{\\text{SC}}_{\\text{RMW}}$, which is akin to sequential consistency in shared memory architectures.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "LURE\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4ecd\u53ef\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\u65b9\u6cd5LURE\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u65b0\u7ed1\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff08LSIS\uff09\u3002", "result": "LURE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\u591a\u4e2a\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "LURE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u5524\u9192\u591a\u4e2a\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002"}}

In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting.

Building on the idea of the handheld demonstration device Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI), we introduce TacUMI, a multi-modal data collection system that integrates additionally ViTac sensors, force-torque sensor, and pose tracker into a compact, robot-compatible gripper design, which enables synchronized acquisition of all these modalities during human demonstrations.

Evaluation on a challenging cable mounting task shows more than 90 percent segmentation accuracy and highlights a remarkable improvement with more modalities, which validates that TacUMI establishes a practical foundation for both scalable collection and segmentation of multi-modal demonstrations in contact-rich tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TacUMI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u957f\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165TacUMI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210ViTac\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u529b-\u626d\u77e9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u7f06\u5b89\u88c5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TacUMI\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present the FAME, a FaaS-based architecture for orchestrating MCP-enabled agentic workflows.

This enables modular composition as AWS Step Functions and avoids function timeouts seen for monolithic agentic workflows. To address context persistence across user requests in a conversation, FAME automates agent memory persistence and injection using DynamoDB. It also optimizes MCP server deployment through AWS Lambda wrappers, caches tool outputs in S3 and proposes function fusion strategies. We evaluate FAME on two representative applications, on research paper summarization and log analytics, under diverse memory and caching configurations.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs.

To mitigate the risk of ARBs early in the development phase, ARB prediction has been introduced into software aging research. However, due to the difficulty of collecting ARBs, within-project ARB prediction faces the challenge of data scarcity, leading to the proposal of cross-project ARB prediction. This task faces two major challenges: 1) domain adaptation issue caused by distribution difference between source and target projects; and 2) severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free samples. Although various methods have been proposed for cross-project ARB prediction, existing approaches treat the input metrics independently and often neglect the rich inter-metric dependencies, which can lead to overlapping information and misjudgment of metric importance, potentially affecting the model's performance. Moreover, they typically use cross-entropy as the loss function during training, which cannot distinguish the difficulty of sample classification. To overcome these limitations, we propose ARFT-Transformer, a transformer-based cross-project ARB prediction framework that introduces a metric-level multi-head attention mechanism to capture metric interactions and incorporates Focal Loss function to effectively handle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on three large-scale open-source projects demonstrate that ARFT-Transformer on average outperforms state-of-the-art cross-project ARB prediction methods in both single-source and multi-source cases, achieving up to a 29.54% and 19.92% improvement in Balance metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARFT-Transformer \u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c Focal Loss\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u9879\u76ee ARB \u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u9879\u76ee ARB \u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684 ARFT-Transformer \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528 Focal Loss \u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARFT-Transformer \u5728\u5355\u6e90\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6807\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347 29.54% \u548c 19.92%\u3002", "conclusion": "ARFT-Transformer \u5728\u8de8\u9879\u76ee ARB \u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s.

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures.

This limitation is particularly relevant in practice, as many systems rely on small vision language models (VLMs) for efficiency. Compared to large language models, small VLMs exhibit weaker decision-making capabilities, making effective prompt design critical for accurate navigation. Inspired by cognitive theories of human learning and motivation, we study prompt design along two dimensions: system guidance (action-focused, reasoning-oriented, and perception-reasoning prompts) and motivational framing, where models compete against humans, other AI systems, or their past selves. Experiments on two socially compliant navigation datasets reveal three key findings. First, for non-finetuned GPT-4o, competition against humans achieves the best performance, while competition against other AI systems performs worst. For finetuned models, competition against the model's past self yields the strongest results, followed by competition against humans, with performance further influenced by coupling effects among prompt design, model choice, and dataset characteristics. Second, inappropriate system prompt design can significantly degrade performance, even compared to direct finetuning. Third, while direct finetuning substantially improves semantic-level metrics such as perception, prediction, and reasoning, it yields limited gains in action accuracy. In contrast, our system prompts produce a disproportionately larger improvement in action accuracy, indicating that the proposed prompt design primarily acts as a decision-level constraint rather than a representational enhancement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578bVLMs\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ade\u4e89\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e2e\u52a9\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u793e\u4ea4\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u56e0\u6548\u7387\u9700\u6c42\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u5176\u4ed6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u793e\u4ea4\u5408\u89c4\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u5728\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GPT-4o\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\u30022) \u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u30023) \u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u52a8\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

A widely used approach to improve dataset diversity involves generating realistic synthetic traffic scenarios. However, producing such scenarios remains difficult due to the precision required when scripting them manually or generating them in a single pass. Natural language offers a flexible way to describe scenarios, but existing text-to-simulation pipelines often rely on static snippet retrieval, limited grammar, single-pass decoding, or lack robust executability checks. Moreover, they depend heavily on constrained LLM prompting with minimal post-processing. To address these limitations, we introduce ARISE - Adaptive Refinement and Iterative Scenario Engineering, a multi-stage tool that converts natural language prompts into executable Scenic scripts through iterative LLM-guided refinement.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

In contrast, biological systems demonstrate an innate ability to acquire skills rapidly from sparse experience. Crucially, current robotic policies struggle to replicate the dynamic stability, reflexive responsiveness, and temporal memory inherent in biological motion. Here we present Neuromorphic Vision-Language-Action (NeuroVLA), a framework that mimics the structural organization of the bio-nervous system between the cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord.

However, the increasing complexity of microservice architectures leads to exponential growth in the fault-injection space, rendering traditional random injection inefficient. Recent lineage-driven approaches mitigate this problem through heuristic pruning, but they face two limitations. First, combinatorial-fault discovery remains bottlenecked by general-purpose SAT solvers, which fail to exploit the monotone and low-overlap structure of derived CNF formulas and typically rely on a static upper bound on fault size. Second, existing techniques provide limited post-injection guidance beyond reporting detected faults. To address these challenges, we propose FastFI, a fault-injection-guided framework to enhance the robustness of API call sites in microservice-based systems. FastFI features a DFS-based solver with dynamic fault injection to discover all valid combinatorial faults, and it leverages fault-injection results to identify critical APIs whose call sites should be hardened for robustness. Experiments on four representative microservice benchmarks show that FastFI reduces end-to-end fault-injection time by an average of 76.12\\% compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining acceptable resource overhead. Moreover, FastFI accurately identifies high-impact APIs and provides actionable guidance for call-site hardening.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastFI \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u548cDFS\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfcAPI\u8c03\u7528\u7ad9\u70b9\u52a0\u56fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6545\u969c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u540e\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "FastFI \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eDFS\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u56fa\u7684\u5173\u952eAPI\u8c03\u7528\u7ad9\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFastFI \u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8676.12%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cdAPI\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u52a0\u56fa\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "FastFI \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dAPI\u8c03\u7528\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u548cDFS\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u7ad9\u70b9\u52a0\u56fa\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, the computing power of a single-edge node is limited, and collaborative computing will cause information leakage and excessive communication overhead. In this paper, we design a parallel collaborative distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and propose a three-phase parallel collaborative ADMM privacy computing (3P-ADMM-PC2) algorithm for distributed computing in edge networks, where the Paillier homomorphic encryption is utilized to protect data privacy during interactions. Especially, a quantization method is introduced, which maps the real numbers to a positive integer interval without affecting the homomorphic operations. To address the architectural mismatch between large-integer and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing, we transform high-bitwidth computations into low-bitwidth matrix and vector operations. Thus the GPU can be utilized to implement parallel encryption and decryption computations with long keys. Finally, a GPU-accelerated 3P-ADMM-PC2 is proposed to optimize the collaborative computing tasks. Meanwhile, large-scale computational tasks are conducted in network topologies with varying numbers of edge nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3P-ADMM-PC2 has excellent mean square error performance, which is close to that of distributed ADMM without privacy-preserving.

The proposed solution has four key components: (1) LiDAR Depth Feature Aggregation (LDFA), where depth-wise deformable sampling is employed for dealing with geometric sparsity, (2) Entropy-Based Feature Smoothing, where cross-entropy is employed for handling domain-specific noise, (3) Adaptive Camera-LiDAR Fusion, where dynamic recalibration of sensor outputs is performed based on model outputs, and (4) Gauss-Mamba Head that uses Selective State Space Models for global context decoding that enjoys linear computation complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u548c\u878d\u5408\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u5411\u5bc6\u96c63D\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u3001\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) LiDAR\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08LDFA\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u91c7\u6837\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u566a\u58f0\uff1b(3) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b(4) Gauss-Mamba\u5934\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76f8\u673a-LiDAR\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u548cLiDAR\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA.

However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u9abc\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u51b2\u51fb\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u59ff\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u53cd\u5f39\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7740\u9646\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c38\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u5f13\u548c\u8db3\u5e95\u7b4b\u819c\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6807\u672c\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u63a2\u6d4b\u7740\u9646\u51b2\u51fb\u540e\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7740\u9646\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u9aa8\u9abc\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5782\u76f4\u4e0b\u843d\u88c5\u7f6e\u6a21\u62df\u7740\u9646\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u7740\u9646\u540e\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u7b80\u5316\u6241\u5e73\u521a\u6027\u8db3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14\u8e1d\u80cc\u5c48\u548c\u8dbe\u4f38\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u963b\u5c3c\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8db3\u90e8\u591a\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u68b0\u8db3\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u59ff\u52bf\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u53cd\u5f39\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u590d\u5236\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Every breakthrough in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, photonics, and cybersecurity relies on advances in software engineering, yet the field is too often treated as a supportive digital component rather than as a strategic, enabling discipline. In policy frameworks, including major European programmes, software appears primarily as a building block within other technologies, while the scientific discipline of software engineering remains largely absent. This position paper argues that the long-term sustainability, dependability, and sovereignty of digital technologies depend on investment in software engineering research.

We introduce a human-annotated dataset from the NASA Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS) using 12-channel, medium to high altitude (3 - 50 km) aerial wildfire images similar to those used in current US wildfire missions. Our dataset combines spectral data from 12 different channels, including infrared (IR), short-wave IR (SWIR), and thermal. We take imagery from 20 wildfire missions and randomly sample small patches to generate over 4000 images with high variability, including occlusions by smoke/clouds, easily-confused false positives, and nighttime imagery.\n  We demonstrate results from a deep-learning model to automate the human-intensive process of fire perimeter determination. We train two deep neural networks, one for image classification and the other for pixel-level segmentation. The networks are combined into a unique real-time segmentation model to efficiently localize active wildfire on an incoming image feed. Our model achieves 96% classification accuracy, 74% Intersection-over-Union(IoU), and 84% recall surpassing past methods, including models trained on satellite data and classical color-rule algorithms. By leveraging a multi-spectral dataset, our model is able to detect active wildfire at nighttime and behind clouds, while distinguishing between false positives. We find that data from the SWIR, IR, and thermal bands is the most important to distinguish fire perimeters.

We evaluate AGEA on medical, agriculture, and literary datasets across Microsoft-GraphRAG and LightRAG systems.

Despite recent progress, existing MM methods still face two key limitations: (i) low sample efficiency, due to ineffective use of redundant data generated during long-term MM interactions; and (ii) poor spatial generalization, as policies trained on specific tasks struggle to transfer to new spatial layouts without additional training. In this paper, we address these challenges through Adaptive Experience Selection (AES) and model-based dynamic imagination. In particular, AES makes MM agents pay more attention to critical experience fragments in long trajectories that affect task success, improving skill chain learning and mitigating skill forgetting. Based on AES, a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) is introduced for Model-Predictive Forward Planning (MPFP) by capturing the coupled dynamics between the mobile base and the manipulator and imagining the dynamics of future manipulations. RSSM-based MPFP can reinforce MM skill learning on the current task while enabling effective generalization to new spatial layouts.

Online Q&A forums such as Stack Overflow provide large-scale settings where such explanations are produced and evaluated, offering valuable insights into what makes them effective. While prior work has explored answer acceptance and voting behavior, little is known about which specific features make explanations genuinely useful. The relative influence of structural, contextual, and linguistic factors, such as content richness, timing, and sentiment, remains unclear. We analyzed 3,323 questions and 59,398 answers from Stack Overflow, combining text analysis and statistical modeling to examine how explanation attributes relate to perceived usefulness (normalized upvotes). Structural and contextual factors, especially explanation length, code inclusion, timing, and author reputation, show small to moderate positive effects. Sentiment polarity has negligible influence, suggesting that clarity and substance outweigh tone in technical communication. This study provides an empirical account of what drives perceived usefulness in developer explanations.

Training data must align not only with the target object categories but also with the sensor characteristics and modalities. To bridge the gap between available datasets and deployment domains, domain adaptation strategies are widely used. In this work, we propose a novel approach to transferring sensor-specific knowledge from an image dataset to LiDAR, an entirely different sensing domain. Our method XD-MAP leverages detections from a neural network on camera images to create a semantic parametric map. The map elements are modeled to produce pseudo labels in the target domain without any manual annotation effort. Unlike previous domain transfer approaches, our method does not require direct overlap between sensors and enables extending the angular perception range from a front-view camera to a full 360 view. On our large-scale road feature dataset, XD-MAP outperforms single shot baseline approaches by +19.5 mIoU for 2D semantic segmentation, +19.5 PQth for 2D panoptic segmentation, and +32.3 mIoU in 3D semantic segmentation.

ICAI'25: 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence https://american-cse.org/csce2025/conferences-ICAI", "summary": "Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SFAA\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0cPhi\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u6570\u636e\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6846\u67b6SFAA\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u533f\u540d\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u89c4\u5219\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6291\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u5730LLMs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fPhi\uff09\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\uff0cPhi\u68c0\u6d4b\u523091%\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e1494.8%\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SFAA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines.

Our approach uses the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to gather context, Tree-sitter to extract relevant code, and LLMs to make decisions and generate fixes. The method evaluates the necessity of range checks concerning performance implications and generates appropriate fixes. We tested this method in a large C++ project, resulting in a 92.73% acceptance rate of the fixes by human developers during the code review. Our LLM-generated fixes reduced the number of warning fix changes that introduced additional instructions due to range checks and exception handling by 39.09% compared to a baseline fix strategy.

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\u03b5+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs.

Validating the outputs requires an oracle and for differential testing of JavaScript, these are constructed manually, making them expensive, time-consuming, and prone to false positives. Worse, when the specification evolves, this manual effort must be repeated.\n  Inspired by the success of agentic systems in other SE domains, this paper introduces SmartOracle. SmartOracle decomposes the manual triage workflow into specialized Large Language Model (LLM) sub-agents.

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction.

We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks.

Few sensing and therapeutic modules are compact, robust, and adaptable enough to measure, and respond to, subtle physiological cues during intraluminal procedures. We present a 1.47 mm diameter modular soft robotic catheter that integrates sensing, actuation, and therapy while retaining the compliance needed for safe endoluminal navigation. Validated across multiple in vivo settings, we emphasize its utility in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a highly technical procedure and a key access route to the pancreas, an organ that is fragile, difficult to instrument, and central to diseases such as pancreatic cancer. Our architecture supports up to four independently controlled functional units, allowing customizable combinations of anchoring, manipulation, sensing, and targeted drug delivery. In a live porcine model, we demonstrate semi-autonomous deployment into the pancreatic duct and 7.5 cm of endoscopic navigation within it, a region currently inaccessible with standard catheters. A closed-loop autonomous/shared-control system that combines a learned model, magnetic actuation, onboard shape sensing, and visual marker tracking further improves cannulation accuracy.

However, its perfor- mance on complex production logs is often unsatisfactory. This performance gap coincides with a known degradation in the accuracy of its core log parsing component on such data, motivating our investigation into a foundational yet unverified question: does higher parsing accuracy necessarily lead to better compression ratio?\n  To answer this, we conduct the first empirical study quanti- fying this relationship and find that a higher parsing accuracy does not guarantee a better compression ratio. Instead, our findings reveal that compression ratio is dictated by achiev- ing effective pattern-based grouping and encoding, i.e., the partitioning of tokens into low entropy, highly compressible groups.\n  Guided by this insight, we design DeLog, a novel log com- pressor that implements a Pattern Signature Synthesis mecha- nism to achieve efficient pattern-based grouping. On 16 public and 10 production datasets, DeLog achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio and speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDeLog\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b7e\u540d\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1DeLog\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e5\u5fd7\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b7e\u540d\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u533a\u4e3a\u4f4e\u71b5\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u7ec4\u3002", "conclusion": "DeLog\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b7e\u540d\u5408\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u572816\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u548c10\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation.

However, their scale incurs substantial computational costs, making full fine-tuning impractical. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like QLoRA enable efficient specialization with lower resource demands. Recent studies show QLoRA-optimized Large Code Models (LCMs) perform strongly across diverse tasks, yet it remains unclear whether this effectiveness persists when a single model is QLoRA fine-tuned for multiple code-related tasks. The interaction between Multi-task fine-tuning and QLoRA optimization, and how transfer learning affects correctness and quality of generated artifacts, remains largely unexplored. We investigate Multi-task QLoRA fine-tuning across three representative tasks: code generation, translation, and summarization.

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "DARA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347AIGB\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2dAI\u751f\u6210\u7ade\u4ef7\uff08AIGB\uff09\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u9700\u5f25\u8865\u5176\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRPO-Adaptive\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1DARA\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cDARA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7d2f\u79ef\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GRPO-Adaptive\u548cDARA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Yet, many packages lack such metadata, and little is known about the underlying reasons. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study combining two targeted surveys sent to 50,000 PyPI authors and maintainers. We analyze more than 1,400 responses using large language model (LLM)-based topic modeling to uncover key motivations and barriers related to linking repositories and donation platforms. While repository URLs are often linked to foster collaboration, increase transparency, and enable issue tracking, some maintainers omit them due to oversight, laziness, or the perceived irrelevance to their project. Donation platform links are reported to support open source work or receive financial contributions, but are hindered by skepticism, technical friction, and organizational constraints.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion.

However, existing state-of-the-art analysis tools for Python only support a few vulnerability types. Hence, there is a need to detect a large variety of vulnerabilities in Python projects.\n  In this paper, we propose the SAGA approach to detect and locate vulnerabilities in Python source code in a versatile way. SAGA includes a source code parser able to extract control- and data-flow information and to represent it as a symbolic control-flow graph, as well as a domain-specific language defining static aspects of the source code and their evolution during graph traversals. We have leveraged this language to define a library of static aspects for integrity, confidentiality, and other security-related properties.\n  We have evaluated SAGA on a dataset of 108 vulnerabilities, obtaining 100% sensitivity and 99.15% specificity, with only one false positive, while outperforming four common security analysis tools.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method.

This frequency mismatch creates an execution blind spot, causing failures in dynamic environments where targets move during the open-loop execution window. We propose TIDAL (Temporally Interleaved Diffusion and Action Loop), a hierarchical framework that decouples semantic reasoning from high-frequency actuation. TIDAL operates as a backbone-agnostic module for diffusion-based VLAs, using a dual-frequency architecture to redistribute the computational budget. Specifically, a low-frequency macro-intent loop caches semantic embeddings, while a high-frequency micro-control loop interleaves single-step flow integration with execution. This design enables approximately 9 Hz control updates on edge hardware (vs. approximately 2.4 Hz baselines) without increasing marginal overhead. To handle the resulting latency shift, we introduce a temporally misaligned training strategy where the policy learns predictive compensation using stale semantic intent alongside real-time proprioception. Additionally, we address the insensitivity of static vision encoders to velocity by incorporating a differential motion predictor. TIDAL is architectural, making it orthogonal to system-level optimizations. Experiments show a 2x performance gain over open-loop baselines in dynamic interception tasks. Despite a marginal regression in static success rates, our approach yields a 4x increase in feedback frequency and extends the effective horizon of semantic embeddings beyond the native action chunk size.

Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve.

An Empirical Study of Failed Agentic Pull Requests in GitHub", "comment": "Accepted at International Mining Software Repositories Conference (MSR 2026)", "summary": "AI coding agents are now submitting pull requests (PRs) to software projects, acting not just as assistants but as autonomous contributors. As these agentic contributions are rapidly increasing across real repositories, little is known about how they behave in practice and why many of them fail to be merged. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale study of 33k agent-authored PRs made by five coding agents across GitHub. (RQ1) We first quantitatively characterize merged and not-merged PRs along four broad dimensions: 1) merge outcomes across task types, 2) code changes, 3) CI build results, and 4) review dynamics. We observe that tasks related to documentation, CI, and build update achieve the highest merge success, whereas performance and bug-fix tasks perform the worst. Not-merged PRs tend to involve larger code changes, touch more files, and often do not pass the project's CI/CD pipeline validation. (RQ2) To further investigate why some agentic PRs are not merged, we qualitatively analyze 600 PRs to derive a hierarchical taxonomy of rejection patterns. This analysis complements the quantitative findings in RQ1 by uncovering rejection reasons not captured by quantitative metrics, including lack of meaningful reviewer engagement, duplicate PRs, unwanted feature implementations, and agent misalignment. Together, our findings highlight key socio-technical and human-AI collaboration factors that are critical to improving the success of future agentic workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8633k\u4e2aAI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684PR\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u6863\u548cCI\u4efb\u52a1\u5408\u5e76\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u548cbug\u4fee\u590d\u6700\u5dee\u3002\u672a\u88ab\u5408\u5e76\u7684PR\u901a\u5e38\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u672a\u901a\u8fc7CI/CD\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u8bb8\u591aPR\u672a\u88ab\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf933k\u4e2a\u7531\u4e94\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684PR\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u5e76\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3001CI\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u52a8\u6001\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9600\u4e2aPR\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u6863\u3001CI\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u65b0\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u548cbug\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002\u672a\u88ab\u5408\u5e76\u7684PR\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u66f4\u591a\u6587\u4ef6\u4e14\u672a\u901a\u8fc7CI/CD\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u88ab\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5982\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u53c2\u4e0e\u3001\u91cd\u590dPR\u3001\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u63d0\u4ea4PR\u65f6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5426\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u89c4\u6a21\u3001CI/CD\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u51b5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u5ba1\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u672a\u88ab\u5408\u5e76PR\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u672a\u6765AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6240\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space.

To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods.

A scheduler uses topological ordering of this graph to select valid next steps and assign them to two robot arms, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel. One arm carries a screwdriver (with an eye-in-hand depth camera) and the other holds or handles components. We demonstrate eGRAP on 3.5in hard drives: as parts are unscrewed and removed, the system updates its graph and plan online.

For a deeper analysis, we have also studied the component where the bug occurred, along with the programming language and framework. This study also investigates the feasibility of automating bug identification. For that, we have built a ReAct agent named BugReAct, equipped with adequate external tools to determine whether it can detect and annotate the bugs in our dataset. According to our study, we found that BugReAct equipped with Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved a remarkable performance in annotating bug characteristics with an average cost of 0.01 USD per post/code snippet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u9879\u5173\u4e8eLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2dbug\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86BugReAct\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8c03\u8bd5\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684bug\uff0c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81eaStack Overflow\u3001GitHub\u548cHugging Face\u8bba\u575b\u76841,187\u7bc7bug\u76f8\u5173\u5e16\u5b50\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684bug\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aBugReAct\u7684ReAct\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316bug\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "BugReAct\u5728\u6807\u6ce8bug\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u81f30.01\u7f8e\u5143/\u5e16\u5b50/\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u914d\u5907Gemini 2.5 Flash\u7684BugReAct\u5728\u6807\u6ce8bug\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u7bc7\u5e16\u5b50/\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a0.01\u7f8e\u5143\u3002"}}

Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

Our results reveal substantial misalignment of VLMs with clinical taxonomies despite high flat performance.

However, many conventional approaches do not explicitly account for velocity and acceleration constraints, resulting in discrepancies between commanded and actual velocities that result in overshoot and degraded tracking performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes dynamic window pure pursuit (DWPP), which fundamentally reformulates the command velocity computation process to explicitly incorporate velocity and acceleration constraints. Specifically, DWPP formulates command velocity computation in the velocity space (the $v$-$\u03c9$ plane) and selects the command velocity as the point within the dynamic window that is closest to the line $\u03c9= \u03bav$. Experimental results demonstrate that DWPP avoids constraint-violating commands and achieves superior path-tracking accuracy compared with conventional pure pursuit methods.

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy.

As such, the assessment of risk in automated driving is key in supporting both motion planning technologies and safety evaluation. In automated driving, risk is characterized by two aspects. The first aspect is the uncertainty on the state estimates of other road participants by an automated vehicle. The second aspect is the severity of a collision event with said traffic participants. Here, the uncertainty aspect typically causes the risk to be non-zero for near-collision events. This makes risk particularly useful for automated vehicle motion planning. Namely, constraining or minimizing risk naturally navigates the automated vehicle around traffic participants while keeping a safety distance based on the level of uncertainty and the potential severity of the impending collision. Existing approaches to calculate the risk either resort to empirical modeling or severe approximations, and, hence, lack generalizability and accuracy. In this paper, we combine recent advances in collision probability estimation with the concept of collision severity to develop a general method for accurate risk estimation. The proposed method allows us to assign individual severity functions for different collision constellations, such as, e.g., frontal or side collisions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, which is beneficial, e.g., in real-time motion planning applications.

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability.

We show that the circuit can be used to (i) generate synthetic datasets that capture the semantics of the ontology; (ii) efficiently perform deductive reasoning on a GPU; (iii) implement neuro-symbolic models whose predictions are approximately or provably consistent with the knowledge defined in the ontology.\n  Results We show that the synthetic dataset generated using the circuit qualitatively captures the semantics of the ontology while being challenging for Machine Learning classifiers, including neural networks. Moreover, we show that compiling the ontology into a circuit is a promising approach for scalable deductive reasoning, with runtimes up to three orders of magnitude faster than available reasoners. Finally, we show that our neuro-symbolic classifiers reliably produce consistent predictions when compared to neural network baselines, maintaining competitive performances or even outperforming them.\n  Conclusions By compiling Description Logic ontologies into circuits, we obtain a tighter integration between the Deep Learning and Knowledge Representation fields.

Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Forest-Chat\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1RSICI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MCI\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "Forest-Chat\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff08MCI\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u548cLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u754c\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cForest-Chat\u5728Forest-Change\u548cLEVIR-MCI-Trees\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Forest-Chat\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RSICI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u2018\u8db3\u591f\u610f\u8bc6\u2019\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u516c\u5171\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8eAI\u610f\u8bc6\u4e0e\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u4ecd\u65e0\u5b9a\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6837\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u5177\u5907\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u80fd\u529b\u5c42\u9762\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u610f\u8bc6\u8f6c\u5411\u2018\u8db3\u591f\u610f\u8bc6\u2019\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5bcc\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose CADGrasp, a two-stage algorithm for general dexterous grasping using single-view point cloud inputs. In the first stage, we predict sparse IBS, a scene-decoupled, contact- and collision-aware representation, as the optimization target. Sparse IBS compactly encodes the geometric and contact relationships between the dexterous hand and the scene, enabling stable and collision-free dexterous grasp pose optimization.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance.

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for understanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi-behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional transformers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behavior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing computational cost.

Consequently, mitigating age-related declines in gait stability and reducing fall risk during walking is a critical goal for assistive devices. Lower-limb exoskeletons have the potential to support users in maintaining stability during walking. However, most exoskeleton controllers are optimized to reduce the energetic cost of walking rather than to improve stability. While some studies report stability benefits with assistance, the effects of specific parameters, such as assistance magnitude and duration, remain unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically modulated the magnitude and duration of torque provided by a bilateral hip exoskeleton during slip perturbations in eight healthy adults, quantifying stability using whole-body angular momentum (WBAM). WBAM responses were governed by a significant interaction between assistance magnitude and duration, with duration determining whether exoskeleton assistance was stabilizing or destabilizing relative to not wearing the exoskeleton device. Compared to an existing energy-optimized controller, experimentally identified stability-optimal parameters reduced WBAM range by 25.7% on average. Notably, substantial inter-subject variability was observed in the parameter combinations that minimized WBAM during perturbations. We found that optimizing exoskeleton assistance for energetic outcomes alone is insufficient for improving reactive stability during gait perturbations. Stability-focused exoskeleton control should prioritize temporal assistance parameters and include user-specific personalization.

This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence.

We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning \"future\" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark.

In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u4ee3CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u5373\u51b3\u7b56\u6267\u884c\u4f46\u8d23\u4efb\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6280\u672f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u5c5e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u4ee3CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u5c5e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u90e8\u7f72\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522bCI\u653e\u5927\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u5c5e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u90e8\u7f72\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u9608\u503c\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8d23\u4efb\u5f52\u5c5e\u53d8\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u53cd\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u660e\u786e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u6216\u5c06\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8f6c\u5411\u6279\u6b21\u6216\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\u5728\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u5f62\u4f46\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce V-CAGE, a closed-loop framework for generating robust, semantically aligned manipulation datasets at scale. First, we propose a context-aware instantiation mechanism that enforces geometric consistency during scene synthesis. By dynamically maintaining a map of prohibited spatial areas as objects are placed, our system prevents interpenetration and ensures reachable, conflict-free configurations in cluttered environments. Second, to bridge the gap between abstract intent and low-level control, we employ a hierarchical instruction decomposition module. This decomposes high-level goals (e.g., \"get ready for work\") into compositional action primitives, facilitating coherent long-horizon planning. Crucially, we enforce semantic correctness through a VLM-based verification loop. Acting as a visual critic, the VLM performs rigorous rejection sampling after each subtask, filtering out \"silent failures\" where code executes but fails to achieve the visual goal.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \\textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \\textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \\textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias.

It requires an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that can run on board light-weight flying robots under tight resource and time constraints, while pushing the physical system to its limits. The state of the art in this area consists of a system with a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that beat human drone racing champions in a controlled indoor environment. Here, we present MonoRace: an onboard drone racing approach that uses a monocular, rolling-shutter camera and IMU that generalizes to a competition environment without any external motion tracking system. The approach features robust state estimation that combines neural-network-based gate segmentation with a drone model. Moreover, it includes an offline optimization procedure that leverages the known geometry of gates to refine any state estimation parameter. This offline optimization is based purely on onboard flight data and is important for fine-tuning the vital external camera calibration parameters. Furthermore, the guidance and control are performed by a neural network that foregoes inner loop controllers by directly sending motor commands.

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively.

Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses.

While multi-frame detection methods leverages temporal cues to improve upon single-frame approaches, existing methods still struggle with inefficient long-range dependency modeling and insufficient robustness. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel scheme for ISTD, realized through a sparse frames-based spatio-temporal semantic feedback network named FeedbackSTS-Det. The core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal semantic feedback strategy with a closed-loop semantic association mechanism, which consists of paired forward and backward refinement modules that work cooperatively across the encoder and decoder. Moreover, both modules incorporate an embedded sparse semantic module (SSM), which performs structured sparse temporal modeling to capture long-range dependencies with low computational cost. This integrated design facilitates robust implicit inter-frame registration and continuous semantic refinement, effectively suppressing false alarms. Furthermore, our overall procedure maintains a consistent training-inference pipeline, which ensures reliable performance transfer and increases model robustness.

Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u672f\u540e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6ce8\u518c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6ImplantFairy\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u659c\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edcRegFreeNet\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u624b\u672f\u5bfc\u677f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u51fa\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8017\u65f6\u626b\u63cf\u672f\u540e\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u518c\u7b97\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u914d\u5bf9CBCT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u659c\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u90bb\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\uff08NDP\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u79cd\u690d\u4f53\u659c\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ImplantFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1622\u4e2aCBCT\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea73D\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86RegFreeNet\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "RegFreeNet\u5728ImplantFairy\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions.

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems.

Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness.

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks.

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality.

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules.

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images.

By integrating RGB with modalities such as thermal and depth, multi-modal fusion increases data redundancy and system robustness. However, significant challenges remain in effectively extracting task-relevant information both within and across modalities, as well as in achieving precise cross-modal alignment. While CNNs excel at feature extraction, they are limited by constrained receptive fields, strong inductive biases, and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models offer global context but suffer from quadratic computational complexity and are confined to pairwise correlation modeling. Mamba and other State Space Models (SSMs), on the other hand, are hindered by their sequential scanning mechanism, which flattens 2D spatial structures into 1D sequences, disrupting topological relationships and limiting the modeling of complex higher-order dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a multi-modal perception network based on hypergraph theory called M2I2HA.

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data.

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance.

Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency.

Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "UBATrack\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STMA\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u867d\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "UBATrack\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSpatio-temporal Mamba Adapter\uff08STMA\uff09\u548cDynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "UBATrack\u5728RGB-T\u3001RGB-D\u548cRGB-E\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728LasHeR\u3001RGBT234\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UBATrack\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter\u548cDynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Experiments on BTCV, AMOS22, and KiTS23 demonstrate that incorporating location context stabilizes training and improves segmentation performance, particularly under low patch-to-volume coverage where global context is missing.

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features.

Submitted to IEEE TCSVT, under review", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising contender to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in 3D scene reconstruction and real-time novel view synthesis. 3DGS outperforms NeRF in training and inference speed but has substantially higher storage requirements. To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry.

To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{F}orcing for \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{F}rame \\textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining.

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities.

To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams.

To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization-composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects.

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively.

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics.

Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods.

All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model.

Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories.

While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Progress-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cProgressLM-45K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ProgressLM-3B\uff09\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ProgressLM-3B\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing.

RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D).

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions.

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision.
