### [1] [AI-Based Culvert-Sewer Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15366)
*Christina Thrainer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出三种方法解决涵洞和污水管道缺陷分割中的数据稀缺问题：预处理策略提升性能、新型FORTRESS架构优化计算效率、少样本学习实现有限数据下的有效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于收集和标注排水系统（如涵洞和污水管道）缺陷数据的复杂性和领域知识需求，大规模数据集难以获取，因此需要探索在有限标注数据条件下提升自动化缺陷分割的方法。

Method: 论文首先评估了预处理策略，包括传统数据增强和动态标签注入；其次引入了FORTRESS架构，结合深度可分离卷积、自适应Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）和多尺度注意力机制；最后研究了少样本语义分割及其在缺陷检测中的应用。

Result: 预处理策略显著提升了分割性能（IoU和F1分数）；FORTRESS在数据集上达到最先进性能，同时减少可训练参数和计算成本；少样本学习方法通过双向原型网络和注意力机制实现了丰富的特征表示和满意的评估结果。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了三种方法来显著增强缺陷分割并处理数据稀缺问题，这些方法可以通过增强训练数据或调整模型架构来实现。

Abstract: Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.
  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

### [2] [Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Heterogeneous Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15406)
*Hatef Otroshi Shahreza,Anjith George,Sébastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在异构人脸识别中表现不佳，尤其在跨光谱条件下与传统系统存在差距，需严格评估其生物特征识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在异构人脸识别（HFR）中的潜力，尤其是在不同传感模态（如VIS、NIR、SWIR、热成像）下的应用。

Method: 通过生物特征协议和多种指标（如获取率、等错误率和真实接受率）评估了多种开源MLLMs在VIS-NIR、VIS-SWIR和VIS-THERMAL等跨模态场景中的识别性能。

Result: MLLMs在跨光谱条件下的识别性能显著低于传统人脸识别系统，揭示了当前MLLMs在HFR中的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在异构人脸识别（HFR）中表现不及传统人脸识别系统，尤其在跨光谱条件下存在显著性能差距。研究强调了在部署MLLMs时进行严格生物特征评估的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSFedMed 通过双尺度联邦框架和知识蒸馏，显著提升了医学图像分割的效率，减少通信和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在联邦设置中的部署面临高计算需求、通信开销和推理成本的挑战，尤其是在医学图像分割任务中。

Method: 提出了 DSFedMed，一种双尺度联邦框架，通过中央基础模型与轻量级客户端模型之间的相互知识蒸馏实现医学图像分割。采用高质量医学图像生成和可学习性引导的样本选择策略来支持蒸馏。

Result: 在五个医学图像分割数据集上的评估显示，DSFedMed 相比现有联邦基础模型基线，平均 Dice 分数提升 2%，通信成本和推理时间减少近 90%。

Conclusion: DSFedMed 在资源受限的联邦部署中展现了显著的效率提升和可扩展性，平均 Dice 分数提升 2%，同时通信成本和推理时间减少近 90%。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型在视觉基础和事实一致性上表现不佳，导致预测不可靠或基础薄弱。

Method: CURE通过基于性能动态调整样本采样，重点训练难样本，优化空间和文本对齐，并在公开数据集上微调多模态教学模型。

Result: CURE将基础准确性提升+0.37 IoU，报告质量提高+0.188 CXRFEScore，幻觉减少18.6%。

Conclusion: CURE是一种数据高效框架，显著提升了视觉语言模型在医学影像报告中的视觉基础准确性和报告可靠性，无需额外数据。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.

### [5] [DuFal: Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning for High-Fidelity Extremely Sparse-view CBCT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15416)
*Cuong Tran Van,Trong-Thang Pham,Ngoc-Son Nguyen,Duy Minh Ho Nguyen,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DuFal通过双频感知学习框架，结合频域与空间域处理，显著提升稀疏视图CBCT重建的高频细节保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏视图CBCT重建中高频细节丢失的问题，传统CNN方法偏向低频信息学习，难以恢复精细解剖结构。

Method: 提出DuFal框架，结合高局部因子化傅里叶神经算子（双分支结构）和跨注意力频率融合模块，通过频域与空间域的双路径处理实现高效重建。

Result: 在LUNA16和ToothFairy数据集上，DuFal在极稀疏视图条件下显著优于现有方法，尤其在保留高频解剖特征方面表现突出。

Conclusion: DuFal框架通过双频感知学习和高效的频域-空间域处理，显著提升了稀疏视图CBCT重建的质量，特别是在高频解剖细节的保留方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.

### [6] [DevPrompt: Deviation-Based Prompt Learning for One-Normal ShotImage Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15453)
*Morteza Poudineh,Marc Lalonde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出偏差引导提示学习框架，结合CLIP模型和统计偏差评分，通过可学习提示和Top-K MIL策略提升少样本异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本正常异常检测（FNSAD）中现有方法在正常与异常提示间区分性弱、缺乏原则性评分机制的问题。

Method: 采用偏差引导提示学习框架，结合视觉语言模型的语义能力和基于偏差评分的统计可靠性，使用可学习的上下文向量和异常特定后缀令牌，并引入偏差损失和Top-K MIL策略。

Result: 在MVTecAD和VISA基准测试中，相比PromptAD等基线方法，实现了更优的像素级检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的偏差引导提示学习框架在MVTecAD和VISA基准测试中表现出色，验证了可学习提示、基于偏差的评分和Top-K MIL策略的有效性。

Abstract: Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.

### [7] [Seeing through Light and Darkness: Sensor-Physics Grounded Deblurring HDR NeRF from Single-Exposure Images and Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15475)
*Yunshan Qi,Lin Zhu,Nan Bao,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于传感器物理的NeRF框架，通过联合优化NeRF网络和映射场，实现了从模糊LDR图像和事件数据中合成清晰HDR新视图的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理低动态范围（LDR）模糊图像时，忽略了传感器物理与真实世界辐射之间的不匹配，导致HDR和去模糊效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于传感器物理的NeRF框架，包括像素级RGB映射场和事件映射场，以对齐渲染像素值与传感器记录的LDR像素值，并联合优化NeRF网络。

Result: 在收集和公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够从单曝光模糊LDR图像和事件数据中实现最先进的去模糊HDR新视图合成效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合NeRF框架和传感器物理模型，成功实现了从单曝光模糊LDR图像和事件数据中合成清晰HDR新视图的目标，并在实验数据上达到了最先进的效果。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

*Jobeal Solomon,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag,Seyed Sahand Mohammadi Ziabari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT替代U-Net在胸部X射线中性化框架中减少属性泄漏，保持诊断准确性，为公平AI提供可行路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X射线分类器中存在的性别和年龄相关偏差导致少数群体的系统性误诊，现有方法无法完全消除属性泄漏。

Method: 研究采用数据高效的Image Transformer Small（DeiT-S）作为中性化器，在ChestX-ray14数据集上进行训练，并通过独立AI评估和卷积神经网络（ConvNet）对生成的图像进行属性泄漏和疾病预测评估。

Result: 在中等编辑强度（alpha=0.5）下，ViT中性化器将性别识别AUC降至约0.80，比原框架低10个百分点，同时15项发现的宏观ROC AUC保持在未编辑基线的5个百分点内，最差子组AUC接近0.70。

Conclusion: 使用Vision Transformer（ViT）替代传统卷积U-Net编码器在Attribute-Neutral Framework中，能够有效减少胸部X射线分类器中的性别和年龄相关偏差，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASAGNA是一种新的图像生成框架，能同时生成图像及其组成层，具有逼真的视觉效果。通过新数据集和基准测试，展示了在多层图像生成和编辑方面的卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像生成模型在编辑现有图像中的特定元素时难以产生可控且一致的结果。分层表示虽然提供了灵活的创作方式，但现有方法无法生成具有连贯合成关系的层，且对象层通常缺乏逼真的视觉效果（如阴影和反射）。

Method: LASAGNA通过从广泛的输入条件（如文本提示、前景、背景和位置掩码）中学习正确的图像合成，实现了更高的可控性。该方法利用了新创建的LASAGNA-48K数据集，该数据集包含干净的背景和具有物理基础的RGBA前景。

Result: LASAGNA在生成多层图像时表现出高度一致性和连贯性，能够准确保留身份和视觉效果，支持多样化的后期编辑应用。LASAGNA-48K数据集和LASAGNABENCH基准测试将公开发布，以促进社区开放研究。

Conclusion: LASAGNA提出了一种新的统一框架，能够生成图像及其组成层，包括逼真的背景和高质量透明前景，具有出色的视觉效果。该框架通过LASAGNA-48K数据集和LASAGNABENCH基准测试，展示了在生成一致且连贯的多层图像方面的卓越性能，并支持多样化的后期编辑应用。

Abstract: Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.

*William Huang,Siyou Pei,Leyi Zou,Eric J. Gonzalez,Ishan Chatterjee,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用手背皮肤形变信息的双流delta编码器方法，显著提升遮挡场景下的手部姿势估计精度，并减少模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XR设备的普及使得自我中心的手部姿势估计成为一项重要任务，但这一视角固有地受到频繁的手指遮挡的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种双流delta编码器，通过对比动态手部与基线放松位置的特征来学习姿势。

Result: 评估表明，仅使用裁剪后的手背图像，该方法在自遮挡场景（手指遮挡>=50%）中，将平均每关节角度误差（MPJAE）降低了18%，优于依赖整个手部几何和大模型骨架的最先进技术。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了在遮挡场景下如食指捏合和轻击估计等下游任务的可靠性，还解锁了新的交互范式，例如在无可见运动的情况下检测等长力以实现表面“点击”，同时最小化模型大小。

Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIOLA是一种标签高效框架，结合最小专家监督和未标记数据，通过密度不确定性采样和置信感知机制，显著提升MLLM在低资源视频领域的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在专业视频领域（如工业或手术场景）中因标注数据稀缺而难以适应的问题。

Method: VIOLA框架采用密度不确定性加权采样方法最大化标注效率，并构建混合池结合置信感知检索和提示机制，以利用未标记数据并减少噪声传播。

Result: 在九个多样化基准测试中使用四种MLLM的实验表明，VIOLA在低资源设置下显著优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: VIOLA框架通过结合最小专家监督和大量未标记数据，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在低资源视频领域的适应能力，实现了在最小标注成本下的稳健性能。

Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

*Sylvey Lin,Eranki Vasistha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Class-Conditional DDPMs在K-pop偶像面部生成中的表现，提出RCA指标揭示视觉质量与语义模式崩溃的权衡，并分析了失败原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DDPM在高保真图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但在细粒度、单领域任务中的语义可控性评估仍具挑战性。标准指标如FID和Inception Score (IS)在此类专业场景中往往无法检测身份错位。

Method: 研究采用Class-Conditional DDPMs进行K-pop偶像面部生成（32x32），并提出校准指标Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA)来评估生成性能。

Result: 模型在视觉质量上表现优异（FID 8.93），但在语义模式上出现严重崩溃（RCA 0.27），尤其是在视觉模糊的身份上。通过混淆矩阵分析，研究者将失败归因于分辨率限制和性别内部模糊性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个严格的框架来验证条件生成模型中的身份一致性，揭示了DDPM在高视觉质量和严重语义模式崩溃之间的关键权衡。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.

Motivation: 解决跨被试EEG情绪识别中因被试间变异性强导致的分布偏移问题，以及情绪相关神经表征在空间组织和时间演化上的高复杂性。

Method: 提出了一个结合功能脑区分区的神经科学先验知识、多尺度时间建模和协作域泛化策略的框架RSM-CoDG，用于跨被试EEG情绪识别。

Result: 在SEED系列数据集上的实验结果表明，RSM-CoDG显著优于现有方法，提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSM-CoDG框架通过整合神经科学先验知识、多尺度时间建模和协作域泛化策略，显著提升了跨被试EEG情绪识别的性能，并在SEED系列数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) remains challenging due to strong inter-subject variability, which induces substantial distribution shifts in EEG signals, as well as the high complexity of emotion-related neural representations in both spatial organization and temporal evolution. Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

Abstract: Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

Conclusion: Event-VStream通过事件感知框架有效解决了长视频流实时理解的挑战，显著提升了性能并保持了低延迟。

Abstract: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

Method: 提出了一个统一的多模态框架Skywork UniPic 3.0，支持任意数量和分辨率的输入图像，并通过数据收集、过滤和合成管道以及序列建模的训练范式解决多图像合成的挑战。

Result: Skywork UniPic 3.0在单图像编辑基准测试中表现最佳，并在多图像合成基准测试中超越了Nano-Banana和Seedream 4.0。

Conclusion: Skywork UniPic 3.0在单图像编辑和多图像合成任务上均实现了最先进的性能，验证了其数据管道和训练范式的有效性。

Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm. Code, models and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 传统GAN在少样本场景下因数据稀缺难以稳定训练，需解决这一矛盾以实现高效SAR图像合成。

Method: 提出一致性正则化生成对抗网络（Cr-GAN），采用双分支判别器架构，结合通道级特征插值策略和双域循环一致性机制。

Result: 在MSTAR和SRSDD数据集上，Cr-GAN在8-shot设置下分别达到71.21%和51.64%的准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Cr-GAN框架通过解耦对抗训练与表征学习，成功解决了在极少量数据下生成高质量SAR图像的难题，显著提升了少样本识别性能。

Abstract: Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Motivation: 当前评估数据信息量的方法未直接关联下游任务性能（如目标检测的mAP），因此提出MGRAL以期望模型输出变化作为信息量衡量标准。

Method: MGRAL利用强化学习采样代理，通过策略梯度优化批量样本选择，并使用快速查找表减少计算开销。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和COCO基准测试中，MGRAL展示了最高的主动学习曲线，并通过可视化验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MGRAL提出了一种基于强化学习的主动学习方法，通过mAP改进作为奖励优化样本选择，显著提升了目标检测任务的性能，并在PASCAL VOC和COCO基准测试中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉安全对齐方面存在严重漏洞，BVS框架成功实现了高达98.21%的越狱成功率。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced complex security challenges, particularly at the intersection of textual and visual safety. While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.

Abstract: This work focuses on national-scale land-use/land-cover (LULC) semantic segmentation using ALOS-2 single-polarization (HH) SAR data over Japan, together with a companion binary water detection task. Building on SAR-W-MixMAE self-supervised pretraining [1], we address common SAR dense-prediction failure modes, boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed labels, without increasing pipeline complexity. We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective. The resulting model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.

Abstract: The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

Abstract: The successful adaptation of foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging is a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

Conclusion: ARDIS框架通过频率解耦架构和潜在引导的隐式重建器，显著提升了跨分辨率恢复的保真度和不可见性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

Conclusion: ES-mHC将高光谱图像分类从纯黑盒预测任务转变为结构透明的部分白盒学习过程，提升了模型的解释性。

Abstract: In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.

TL;DR: FeTal-SAM adapts SAM for fetal brain MRI segmentation, using atlas-based prompts to avoid retraining for new labels, achieving robust performance but with lower accuracy for low-contrast structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation, specifically the inflexibility of traditional deep learning methods requiring large annotated datasets for fixed labels and the lack of insight into segmentation drivers (image contrast vs. spatial priors).

Method: The method integrates atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, using multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates as dense prompts alongside a bounding-box prompt for SAM's segmentation decoder. This enables binary segmentation per structure, fused to reconstruct full 3D volumes.

Result: FeTal-SAM achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines for well-contrasted structures (e.g., cortical plate, cerebellum) and maintains flexibility for user-specified anatomies, though with slightly lower accuracy for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala).

Conclusion: FeTal-SAM represents a promising advancement toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools, offering flexibility and robust performance without the need for exhaustive retraining.

Abstract: This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.

Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法多基于像素域或隐式特征表示，忽略了图像的几何结构先验。2DGS具有出色的结构拟合能力，但尚未用于低级视觉任务。

Method: 提出LL-GaussianMap框架，分为两个阶段：1) 使用2DGS进行高保真结构重建；2) 通过高斯泼溅的光栅化机制渲染数据驱动的增强字典系数。

Result: 实验表明，LL-GaussianMap在增强性能和存储效率上均表现优异，验证了显式高斯表示在图像增强中的有效性。

Conclusion: LL-GaussianMap通过结合2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）技术，在低光图像增强任务中取得了显著效果，不仅保留了图像边缘结构，还减少了伪影，且无需依赖配对数据。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.

Conclusion: LL-GaussianImage 验证了在压缩表示域内直接处理的可行性和优越性，实现了低光图像的高质量增强同时保持高压缩比。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) aims to reconstruct the complete neuronal connectome; however, current deep learning-based methods are limited by their reliance on large-scale training data and extensive, time-consuming manual annotations. Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

Method: 引入了一个合成基准测试，通过最小视频对测试三种挑战：区分暴力与良性活动、跨视角绑定攻击者角色以及判断细粒度轨迹对齐。

Result: 结果显示在训练免费设置下，近期VLMs在各项任务中表现仅略高于随机水平。简单的辅助（稳定颜色线索）部分减少了攻击者角色混淆，但未解决根本弱点。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据和代码，旨在提供可复现的诊断方法，并探索轻量级空间先验以补充大规模预训练。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight experimentation pipeline designed to lower the barrier for applying machine learning (ML) methods for classifying images in ecological research. We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).

Abstract: The increasing global demand for sustainable agriculture necessitates intelligent monitoring systems that optimize resource utilization and plant health management. Traditional farming methods rely on manual observation and periodic watering, often leading to water wastage, inconsistent plant growth, and delayed response to environmental changes. This paper presents a comprehensive IoT-based smart plant monitoring system that integrates multiple environmental sensors with automated irrigation and cloud analytics. The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.

Abstract: With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.

However, in real-world clinical settings, angiographic images are often characterized by complex lesion morphology, severe class imbalance, label uncertainty, and limited computational resources, posing substantial challenges to conventional deep learning approaches in terms of robustness and generalization.Methods: The proposed framework is built upon a pretrained convolutional neural network to construct a lightweight hybrid neural representation. A selective neural plasticity training strategy is introduced to enable efficient parameter adaptation. Furthermore, a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function, combining Focal Loss with label smoothing, is employed to enhance sensitivity to hard samples and uncertain annotations. Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.

Motivation: 现有方法虽有一定效果，但TV-OOD旨在通过改进技术进一步提升机器学习模型部署中的分布偏移安全性。

Method: 采用总变分网络估计器计算每个输入对整体总变分的贡献，定义为总变分分数，用于区分分布内外数据。

Conclusion: TV-OOD方法通过利用总变分网络估计器，有效区分了分布内和分布外数据，在多种模型和数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to securing machine learning model deployments against potential distribution shifts in practical applications, the Total Variation Out-of-Distribution (TV-OOD) detection method. Existing methods have produced satisfactory results, but TV-OOD improves upon these by leveraging the Total Variation Network Estimator to calculate each input's contribution to the overall total variation. By defining this as the total variation score, TV-OOD discriminates between in- and out-of-distribution data. The method's efficacy was tested across a range of models and datasets, consistently yielding results in image classification tasks that were either comparable or superior to those achieved by leading-edge out-of-distribution detection techniques across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/YifanChen02/PMPBench.

Motivation: 视觉基础模型（VFMs）在不同下游任务中表现不均，可能源于预训练目标与下游视觉成像任务需求的不匹配。本文旨在通过具体临床领域研究这种对齐对性能的影响。

Method: 评估了两个视觉基础模型（基于重建的MAE模型ProFound和基于对比学习的模型ProViCNet）在五个前列腺多参数MR成像任务上的表现，研究了任务对齐如何影响迁移性能。

Result: 结果表明，预训练与下游任务之间的更好对齐（通过MMD等度量）与性能提升和收敛速度正相关。

Abstract: Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.

Conclusion: RadJEPA作为一种不依赖语言监督的自监督框架，在疾病分类、语义分割和报告生成任务中表现优异，性能超越包括Rad-DINO在内的现有先进方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision language models guide the learning of visual representations; however, this form of supervision is constrained by the availability of paired image text data, raising the question of whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without relying on language supervision. In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态场景重建中难以充分利用互补信息，且缺乏对跨模态相关性和物理差异的自适应处理。

Result: 在RGBT-Scenes数据集上实现了最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: ThermoSplat通过主动特征调制和自适应几何解耦，实现了跨模态的深度光谱感知重建，显著提升了RGB和热红外数据的融合效果。

Abstract: Multi-modal scene reconstruction integrating RGB and thermal infrared data is essential for robust environmental perception across diverse lighting and weather conditions. However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on the RGBT-Scenes dataset demonstrate that ThermoSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality across both visible and thermal spectrums.

Method: 通过模块转移控制、针对性单模块适应和破坏性消融实验，系统分析了情感导向监督如何重塑模型内部参数。

Result: 情感适应主要集中于前馈门控投影(\texttt{gate\_proj})而非注意力模块，仅调整约24.5\%的参数即可达到AffectGPT在八项情感任务中96.6\%的平均性能。

Conclusion: 情感能力在基础模型中主要由前馈门控机制结构中介，且\texttt{gate\_proj}被确认为情感建模的核心架构位置。

Abstract: Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决实时情绪识别在VR治疗中的严格延迟要求（MTP延迟低于140毫秒），现有深度学习模型通常优先考虑准确性而非实时性，限制了其在商品硬件上的应用。

Method: 研究使用UIBVFED数据集，对YOLO（v8、v11、v12）的中型和纳米变体进行面部检测评估，同时测试了通用视觉Transformer模型（如CLIP、SigLIP和ViT-FER）在CPU上的推理性能。

Result: 结果显示，面部检测在风格化虚拟角色上表现稳健（100%准确率），但分类阶段存在“延迟墙”。YOLOv11n在检测中表现最佳（约54毫秒），而通用Transformer模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）无法满足实时性要求（准确率<23%，延迟>150毫秒）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了轻量级、领域专用架构的必要性，以实现治疗场景中可访问的实时AI。

Abstract: In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation supports surgical applications such as skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, and geometry-aware workflow analysis. However, surgical environments pose severe challenges, including intense and localized lighting, frequent occlusions by instruments or staff, and uniform hand appearance due to gloves, combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets for reliable model training.

Method: We propose a robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgical contexts that requires no domain-specific fine-tuning and relies solely on off-the-shelf pretrained models. The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.

Result: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.

Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种基于类别和置信度的重加权方案，有效解决了长尾数据分布下深度神经网络的性能退化问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.

Conclusion: NeuroMamba框架通过结合局部特征建模和全局依赖捕获，显著提升了神经元分割的精度，尤其在处理各向异性和各向同性分辨率数据时表现出色。

Abstract: Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: EvolSplat4D在静态和动态场景重建中表现出更高的准确性和一致性，超越了现有的逐场景优化和前馈基线方法。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

Conclusion: HyperAlign 通过动态生成低秩适应权重来调制扩散模型的生成操作，显著提升了语义一致性和视觉吸引力，优于现有的微调和测试时缩放基线。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but often fail to generate outputs that align with human preferences and intentions, resulting in images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.

Conclusion: PhysicsMind作为一个统一的基准测试，揭示了当前多模态大语言模型和视频世界模型在物理理解上的不足，强调了其在物理感知多模态模型发展中的重要性。

Abstract: Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

Motivation: 传统H&E图像到IHC合成的直接外观合成方法因缺乏结构先验导致语义不一致，需改进。

Method: 提出Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT)框架，通过Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map)实现结构优先的条件生成。

Result: 在IHC4BC和MIST数据集上，PAINT在结构保真度和临床下游任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAINT通过结构优先的自回归框架，在虚拟免疫组化（IHC）合成任务中表现出色，验证了结构引导的自回归建模潜力。

Abstract: Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.

Conclusion: ProGiDiff框架通过利用现有图像生成模型，结合ControlNet风格的调节机制和自定义编码器，成功实现了医学图像分割的多类别支持，并展示了在CT和MR图像分割中的强大性能和跨模态适应性。

Abstract: Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.

Motivation: 单目视频中的人体运动重建在遮挡情况下具有挑战性，现有方法在鲁棒性或效率上存在不足。

Method: MoRo 是一个基于生成掩码建模的端到端框架，通过跨模态学习方案整合运动轨迹、姿态先验和视频条件掩码变换器。

Result: 在 EgoBody 和 RICH 数据集上的实验显示，MoRo 在遮挡情况下提升了准确性和运动真实性。

Conclusion: MoRo 在遮挡情况下显著优于现有方法，同时在非遮挡场景中表现相当，实现了实时推理（70 FPS）。

Abstract: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级能力对构建交互式智能系统至关重要，但现有的像素级多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）难以扩展，因为涉及复杂的区域级编码器、专用分割解码器和不兼容的训练目标。

Method: SAMTok是一种离散掩码令牌化器，将任何区域掩码转换为两个特殊令牌，并通过这些令牌高保真地重建掩码。它基于SAM2，使用掩码编码器和残差向量量化器在2.09亿个多样化掩码上训练，生成离散、紧凑且信息丰富的令牌。

Result: QwenVL-SAMTok在区域描述、区域VQA、接地对话、参考分割、场景图解析和多轮交互分割等任务上达到最先进或可比的结果。通过引入文本答案匹配奖励，GRES和GCG基准上的掩码生成任务得到显著提升。

Conclusion: SAMTok提出了一种可扩展且简单的方法，通过将区域掩码转换为语言令牌，使多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）具备强大的像素级能力，无需架构修改或专用损失设计。

Abstract: Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.

Abstract: Although Mamba models greatly improve Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification, they have critical challenges in terms defining efficient and adaptive token sequences for improve performance. This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework. Third, to further improve feature learning capability, we introduce an Attention-Driven Token Selection mechanism to optimize Mamba token sequencing. Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner. Experiments on the Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Liao-Ning 01 datasets demonstrate that CSSMamba achieves higher accuracy and better boundary preservation compared to state-of-the-art CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of diversity and real-world relevance in current CIR benchmarks.

Method: Leveraged image editing for precise control to synthesize diverse queries, constructing EDIR with 5,000 high-quality queries across multiple categories.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle across all subcategories, exposing modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: EDIR benchmark highlights significant gaps in current CIR models, revealing limitations in existing benchmarks and model architectures.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.

Motivation: 现有像素空间水印方法存在计算开销大和视觉伪影问题，需探索更高效的潜在空间水印方案。

Method: 通过训练潜在空间的后处理水印模型，并将其蒸馏到生成模型或潜在解码器中，实现模型内水印。

Result: 潜在水印在保持不可感知性的同时，实现了高达20倍的加速，并展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DistSeal在潜在空间水印方面提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著优于传统的像素空间水印方法。

Abstract: Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.

Method: 首先调整3D扩散阶段以生成表示时间变化和独立3D形状的同步潜在序列，然后设计一个时序3D自动编码器将独立形状序列转换为预定义参考形状的对应变形，从而构建动画。

Result: 在标准视频到4D基准测试（Consistent4D、Objaverse）上，ActionMesh在几何精度和时间一致性上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ActionMesh通过引入时间3D扩散模型和时序3D自动编码器，能够以前所未有的速度和质量生成动画3D网格，适用于多种输入方式，并在几何精度和时间一致性上达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本-视频检索方法存在'盲目'特征交互问题，模型难以从背景噪声中识别关键视觉信息。受人类认知行为启发，提出HVD模型以解决这一问题。

Method: HVD模型包含两个关键组件：帧特征选择模块（FFSM）和补丁特征压缩模块（PFCM）。FFSM通过选择关键帧消除时间冗余，PFCM通过高级注意力机制将补丁特征聚合为显著视觉实体。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的大量实验表明，HVD不仅能捕捉人类视觉焦点，还实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HVD模型通过模仿人类视觉认知行为，提出了从粗到细的对齐机制，显著提升了文本-视频检索的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: The success of CLIP has driven substantial progress in text-video retrieval. However, current methods often suffer from "blind" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在图像和视频的视角到360°生成任务中表现优于现有方法，并在零样本相机视场和方向估计任务中展示了竞争力。

Conclusion: 360Anything通过纯数据驱动的方法实现了无几何依赖的视角到全景图的转换，并在图像和视频生成任务中达到了最先进的性能。此外，该方法还展示了在零样本相机视场和方向估计任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

Motivation: 探究RAEs框架是否可扩展至大规模自由文本到图像生成，并验证其在ImageNet之外的适用性。

Method: 通过扩展RAE解码器并在冻结的表示编码器上训练，比较RAE与FLUX VAE在不同参数规模下的表现。

Result: RAEs在所有模型规模下均优于VAEs，训练更稳定且生成质量更高。

Conclusion: RAEs在大型文本到图像生成中表现出色，比VAEs更简单且性能更强，为统一模型提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.

Abstract: We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### [69] [Gated Sparse Attention: Combining Computational Efficiency with Training Stability for Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15305)
*Alfred Shen,Aaron Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSA通过结合稀疏和门控注意力，高效提升长上下文模型的性能与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文语言模型中注意力计算负担过重的问题，同时弥补稀疏注意力和门控注意力各自的不足。

Method: GSA采用带sigmoid激活的门控闪电索引器、自适应稀疏控制器以及值和输出阶段的双重门控。

Result: 在1.7B参数模型上，GSA实现了12-16倍的加速，困惑度从6.03降至5.70，RULER分数几乎翻倍，首token注意力占比从47%降至4%，训练稳定性显著提升。

Conclusion: GSA结合了稀疏注意力和门控注意力的优势，在保持高效的同时显著提升了模型质量和训练稳定性。

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

*Ethan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在急诊分诊中存在基于代理变量的偏见，需进一步优化以确保临床安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）在临床决策中的潜在偏见，特别是在急诊分诊场景中对不同背景患者的影响。

Method: 使用32个患者级代理变量，通过公共和受限数据集评估LLM在急诊分诊中的偏见。

Result: 发现LLM通过代理变量表现出歧视性行为，并会因输入上下文中的特定标记而系统性改变对患者严重程度的判断。

Conclusion: AI系统在临床决策中仍存在基于代理变量的偏见，需进一步改进以确保安全可靠的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准存在两个关键问题：真实综述数据集不可靠，且评估指标仅关注表面质量，无法评估深层学术价值。

Method: 通过构建一个包含学术价值标注的可靠数据集，并设计涵盖信息价值、学术交流价值和研究指导价值的综合评价标准。

Conclusion: DeepSurvey-Bench 提出了一种新的基准测试，能够全面评估生成综述的学术价值，并在实验中显示出与人类评估高度一致的结果。

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

*Mustafa Arslan*

TL;DR: Aeon 是一种神经符号认知操作系统，通过结构化内存和预测缓存机制，解决了 LLMs 在长上下文窗口中的计算和推理问题，实现了高效检索和状态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自注意力机制的计算成本和上下文窗口扩展时的推理能力退化问题上存在根本性限制，现有解决方案（如 Flat RAG 架构）无法捕捉长时交互的层次和时间结构。

Method: Aeon 将内存结构化分为 Memory Palace（空间索引）和 Trace（神经符号事件图），并引入 Semantic Lookaside Buffer（SLB）作为预测缓存机制。

Result: Aeon 在对话工作负载上实现了 <1ms 的检索延迟，并通过零拷贝 C++/Python 桥确保了状态一致性，为自主代理提供了持久化、结构化的内存支持。

Conclusion: Aeon 作为一种神经符号认知操作系统，通过重新定义内存为动态管理的操作系统资源，成功解决了大型语言模型在长上下文窗口中的计算成本和推理能力退化问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.

Motivation: 近年来，大型视觉语言模型的快速发展推动了多模态假新闻检测的范式转变，但缺乏系统性的综述来追踪这一转变并整合最新进展。

Method: 通过历史视角梳理从传统多模态检测到基础模型驱动范式的演变，建立涵盖模型架构、数据集和性能基准的结构化分类法。

Result: 本文填补了这一空白，提供了全面的综述，分析了剩余技术挑战，并指导了下一阶段的研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面系统地综述了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态假新闻检测（MFND）中的变革性作用，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

*Raffi Khatchadourian*

TL;DR: DFAH框架评估LLM代理在金融服务中的确定性和忠实性，发现较小模型表现更优，且确定性与忠实性呈正相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在监管审计回放中表现不佳，大多数部署无法在相同输入下返回一致的结果。

Method: 本文提出了确定性-忠实性保证框架（DFAH），用于测量工具使用代理在金融服务中的轨迹确定性和证据条件忠实性。

Result: 在非代理基线实验中，7-20B参数模型实现了100%的确定性，而120B+模型需要3.7倍更大的验证样本才能达到相同的统计可靠性。代理工具使用引入了额外的方差。

Conclusion: 在DFAH评估设置下，采用模式优先架构的一级模型达到了符合审计回放要求的确定性水平。

Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prometheus Mind通过530MB适配器为Qwen3-4B添加可逆记忆功能，解决了提取、训练、注入和隐藏状态崩溃问题，检索率在清晰输入中达94.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为预训练语言模型添加记忆功能通常需要架构修改或权重调整，本研究旨在通过轻量级适配器实现这一目标。

Method: 通过Contrastive Direction Discovery（CDD）提取语义方向，分阶段训练适配器，利用lm_head.weight映射，并训练投影恢复隐藏状态区分。

Result: 在PrometheusExtract-132上，系统在清晰输入中达到94.4%检索率，但在非正式输入中降至19.4%。关系分类准确率为47.3%。

Conclusion: Prometheus Mind成功通过模块化适配器为预训练语言模型添加了记忆功能，且完全可逆。主要瓶颈在于关系分类（47.3%准确率），影响了提取效果。

Abstract: Adding memory to pretrained language models typically requires architectural changes or weight modification. We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36). The primary bottleneck is relation classification (47.3% accuracy), responsible for most extraction errors.

Motivation: 知识图谱研究快速发展，但在高级逻辑推理、人工智能技术、专用编程语言及现代概率统计理论等方面的应用仍显不足，尤其是多知识图谱协作与竞争技术未获足够关注。

Method: 研究涵盖了知识图谱网络的定义、开发、推理、计算和应用，涉及模糊、不确定、多模态、向量化、分布式和联邦等多种条件下的处理。

Conclusion: 本文提出了'知识图谱网络'的系统理论、技术和应用，特别是在医疗和健康领域的应用，并提供了创新性结论。

Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出BIRD-Python基准和LCF框架，证明Text-to-Python在解决领域上下文问题后可媲美Text-to-SQL的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Python等通用编程语言在数据分析中的需求增长，但Text-to-Python在核心数据检索中的可靠性尚未得到充分研究，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究团队引入了BIRD-Python基准，用于跨范式评估，并通过Logic Completion Framework (LCF)来解决Python代码生成中的歧义问题。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)性能差异主要源于缺失的领域上下文而非代码生成的内在限制；(2)当这些差距被解决时，Text-to-Python能达到与Text-to-SQL相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Python可以作为分析代理的可行基础，前提是系统能有效将模糊的自然语言输入转换为可执行的逻辑规范。

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Motivation: 基因表达数据因隐私法规和实验成本难以广泛用于研究，GeMM-GAN旨在通过生成模型解决这一限制。

Method: GeMM-GAN采用Transformer编码器处理图像块，并通过跨注意力机制将图像块与文本标记结合，生成条件向量以指导生成模型。

Result: 在TCGA数据集上，GeMM-GAN优于标准生成模型，生成的基因表达谱更真实且功能意义更强，疾病类型预测准确率提升11%以上。

Conclusion: GeMM-GAN通过结合组织病理学切片和临床元数据，成功生成了生物意义连贯的基因表达谱，显著提升了疾病类型预测的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: This thesis explores the use of a General Game System (GGS) to support the automatic expansion of game boards in boardless games. Traditional implementations of such games often rely on oversized static boards defined from the start, even though large portions of these boards may never be used during gameplay. This approach leads to unnecessary complexity. To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.

TL;DR: LOGIC框架通过在解码层直接操作，显著提升了Speech LLMs处理新兴实体的能力，降低了错误率且几乎不影响误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speech LLMs在处理新兴实体（如联系人名称、播放列表或技术术语）时表现不佳，现有解决方案（如提示或生成式错误校正）存在可扩展性差或过度校正的问题。

Method: LOGIC（Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing）是一种高效的框架，通过在解码层直接操作，解耦上下文注入和输入处理，确保与提示长度无关的恒定时间复杂度。

Result: 在11种多语言环境中使用Phi-4-MM模型进行的广泛实验表明，LOGIC平均相对降低了9%的实体错误率，误报率仅增加0.30%。

Conclusion: LOGIC框架通过直接在解码层操作，有效解决了Speech LLMs在处理新兴实体时的局限性，显著降低了实体错误率，同时保持了较低的误报率。

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Method: 论文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过将奉承性评估为零和博弈中的赌局，使用LLM-as-a-judge来直接且中立地评估LLM的奉承性。

Result: 研究发现，所有模型在常见设置中表现出奉承倾向，但Claude和Mistral在损害第三方时会表现出‘道德悔恨’。此外，所有模型对最后提出的答案存在偏见，且奉承性和近期偏见相互作用。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，所有测试的模型都表现出奉承倾向，但Claude和Mistral在明确损害第三方时会表现出‘道德悔恨’。此外，所有模型对最后提出的答案存在偏见，且奉承性和近期偏见相互作用，加剧了与用户意见一致的倾向。

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种统一的张量网络形式主义，能够结合神经和符号方法，并通过Hybrid Logic Network实现了逻辑和概率模型的混合定义与训练。

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

Conclusion: 可信赖的法律AI需要基于检索的架构，强调验证和可追溯性，并提供适用于其他高风险领域的评估框架。

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

TL;DR: MiRAGE 是一个多智能体框架，用于生成复杂、多模态和多跳的问答数据集，填补了专业领域 RAG 系统评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集通常依赖通用领域语料或纯文本检索，无法捕捉专业技术文档的复杂性，其中信息是多模态的且需要综合分散证据进行推理。

Method: MiRAGE 是一个多智能体框架，用于 RAG 系统评估，通过协作的专门智能体群生成经过验证的、领域特定的、多模态和多跳问答数据集。这些智能体包括递归上下文优化循环、对抗性验证智能体和识别专家角色及领域的智能体。

Result: 在四个不同领域（法规、金融、定量生物学和新闻业）的广泛实证评估表明，MiRAGE 生成的数据集具有显著更高的推理复杂性（平均 >2.3 跳）和事实忠实度。

Conclusion: MiRAGE 通过自动化生成反映专有语料潜在主题结构的黄金标准评估数据集，为严格基准测试下一代信息检索系统提供了必要的基础设施。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACK 是一个新基准，用于评估 LLMs 在多步推理中如何处理冲突知识，结果显示提供更新事实可能损害推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单一知识更新和事实回忆，未评估这些更新如何影响下游推理。

Method: 引入 TRACK 基准，涵盖三个推理密集型场景（WIKI、CODE 和 MATH），模拟现实世界的复杂性。

Result: 研究显示，为模型提供更新事实进行推理可能比不提供更新事实表现更差，且性能下降随着提供更多更新事实而加剧。

Conclusion: TRACK 提供了一个严格的新基准，用于衡量和指导未来在多步推理中传播冲突知识的进展。

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

Method: 通过实验观察，分析了Transformer模型在情感分析中的表现，特别关注了准确性提升与情感极化、中立性缺失之间的关系。

Result: 实验发现，Transformer模型在提高某一情感类别准确性的同时，会导致其他情感类别的极化和中立性的丧失。

Conclusion: 论文指出，尽管Transformer和迁移学习在情感分析中提高了准确性，但也导致了情感极化和中立性缺失的问题，这对依赖情感分析输出的实际应用构成了挑战。

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Conclusion: TransportAgents框架通过多智能体协作和MLP整合模块，显著提升了交通碰撞严重性预测的准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性，适用于安全关键决策支持应用。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

Result: 通过医学决策作为认知压力测试，证明世界模型的价值在于支持反事实推理、干预规划和稳健的长期预见。

Conclusion: 有效的世界模型应编码因果结构、遵循领域特定约束并保持长期稳定性，而非仅追求视觉真实性。

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

Motivation: 现有个性化学习系统往往专注于单一功能（如知识追踪或资源推荐），缺乏整合，ALIGNAgent旨在通过多智能体框架实现自适应循环。

Method: ALIGNAgent采用多智能体框架，结合学生测验表现、成绩数据和偏好，通过技能差距代理进行概念级诊断推理，推荐代理则提供偏好感知的学习材料。

Result: 在真实本科计算机科学课程数据上的评估显示，ALIGNAgent在知识熟练度评估上的精度达0.87-0.90，F1分数为0.84-0.87。

Conclusion: ALIGNAgent通过整合知识追踪、技能差距识别和资源推荐，有效提升了个性化学习的效果，实证结果显示其在知识熟练度评估上具有高精度和高F1分数。

Abstract: Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业系统因部门隔离、流程僵化和硬编码自动化而难以适应动态业务需求，而LLMs虽擅长处理自然语言和非结构化数据，但缺乏确定性执行复杂业务逻辑的能力。

Method: AUTOBUS将业务计划建模为具有明确前后条件、数据需求、评估规则和API级操作的任务网络，并通过逻辑引擎执行任务特定的逻辑程序。

Result: AUTOBUS通过逻辑引擎协调辅助工具和执行操作，实现了业务计划的自动化协调，同时保留了人类对关键决策的监督。

Conclusion: AUTOBUS通过结合LLM代理、谓词逻辑编程和企业语义数据，提出了一种神经符号AI架构，用于协调端到端业务计划，解决了企业系统在动态业务环境中的灵活性问题。

Abstract: Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

Motivation: 医疗保健组织在将代理AI嵌入常规工作流程时面临代理泛滥问题，如重复代理、责任不清、控制不一致和工具权限超出原始用例。现有AI治理框架缺乏对代理舰队日常运营的指导。

Method: 通过快速、实践导向的综合治理标准、代理安全文献和医疗保健合规要求，提出了统一代理生命周期管理（UALM）蓝图。UALM将常见问题映射到五个控制平面层。

Result: UALM提供了一个包含五个控制平面层的蓝图，并附带一个成熟度模型支持分阶段采用。

Conclusion: UALM为医疗保健组织提供了一个可实施的蓝图，用于管理代理AI的日常运营，确保审计就绪的监督，同时保留本地创新并实现更安全的大规模应用。

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）中的幻觉问题（生成看似合理但不忠实于事实的内容），这是高风险部署的关键障碍。

Method: 引入了一种混合检测框架，结合了神经科学启发的信号设计和监督机器学习，提取了基于预测编码和信息瓶颈的可解释信号。

Result: 在HaluBench（n=200，完全平衡）上评估，理论指导的基线达到0.8017 AUROC，改进特征将性能提升至0.8669 AUROC（4.95%增益），同时使用比Lynx少75倍的训练数据（200 vs 15,000样本）和1000倍更快的推理速度（5ms vs 5s）。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过将领域知识编码到信号架构中，可以在数据效率上优于扩展LLM法官，使用轻量级（少于100万参数）、可解释的模型实现强大的性能，适合生产部署。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.
  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.
  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.
  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: AUQ框架通过结合系统1和系统2的机制，显著提升了AI代理的可靠性和性能，代表了向可靠代理迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.

Conclusion: Cosmos Policy通过单一阶段的后训练，成功将预训练视频模型转化为高效的机器人策略，无需架构修改，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

Motivation: 随着前沿AI模型的全球部署，确保其在多样化的语言和文化背景下的行为安全和可靠至关重要。

Method: 由新加坡AISI领导，测试了两个开放权重模型在十种语言（包括高资源和低资源语言）中的表现，评估了超过6,000个新翻译的提示，涵盖了五种危害类别。

Result: 研究发现安全行为在不同语言间存在差异，包括保护措施的稳健性、评估者可靠性（LLM作为评委与人工评审）的不同，并提出了改进多语言安全评估的方法论见解。

Conclusion: 本研究为高级AI系统的多语言安全测试提供了一个初步的共享框架，并呼吁与更广泛的研究社区和行业继续合作。

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based Text-to-SQL系统在复杂企业环境中面临扩展性、效率和稳定性问题，需要一种更高效的适应性推理方法。

Method: AgentSM通过捕获或合成结构化的执行轨迹作为语义记忆，直接指导未来的推理过程，而非依赖原始草稿或向量检索。

Result: 在Spider 2.0基准测试中，AgentSM平均减少25%的token使用和35%的轨迹长度，并在Spider 2.0 Lite上达到44.8%的最先进执行准确率。

Conclusion: AgentSM通过引入可解释的语义记忆框架，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务在复杂企业环境中的效率和准确性，达到了当前最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based Text-to-SQL have achieved remarkable gains on public benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider. Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark. It also improves execution accuracy, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 44.8% on the Spider 2.0 Lite benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常在相同类型的DFJSS实例上训练和测试GP演化的规则，仅通过随机种子区分，而未探索其跨类型泛化能力。

Method: 通过在多维度（包括问题规模、关键车间参数和数据分布）上进行一系列实验，分析这些因素对GP在未见实例类型上性能的影响。

Result: 结果显示，当训练实例包含比测试实例更多的作业且机器数量固定时，以及当训练和测试实例具有相似规模或车间参数时，泛化效果较好。决策点的数量和分布对性能差异起关键作用。

Conclusion: 本研究为DFJSS中GP的泛化能力提供了新见解，并强调了开发更具泛化能力的GP规则以有效处理异构DFJSS实例的必要性。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSS) is a complex combinatorial optimisation problem that requires simultaneous machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions in dynamic production environments. Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

Conclusion: TabII方法通过信息瓶颈理论指导，结合大型语言模型和预训练TabAdapter，成功实现了在推理阶段动态整合新增列的能力，并在多个公开数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: SigEnt-SAC 是一种基于演员-评论家的离策略方法，通过引入sigmoid限制的熵项，防止负熵驱动的优化和减少Q函数振荡。

Result: 在D4RL任务上，SigEnt-SAC显著减少了Q函数振荡，并更快达到100%成功率；在四种现实机器人任务中，仅需少量交互即可学习成功策略。

Conclusion: SigEnt-SAC 提出了一种低成本的现实世界强化学习方法，通过单条专家轨迹学习，显著减少了Q函数振荡，并在多种现实机器人任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

Motivation: AI代理在复杂多步任务中的过度自信是高风险场景部署的主要障碍，现有静态单轮输出校准方法无法解决代理系统的独特挑战。

Method: 提出了Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC)框架，通过提取代理整个轨迹中的宏观动态和微观稳定性等丰富过程级特征，使用简单可解释的模型进行校准。

Result: HTC在八个基准测试、多种LLM和不同代理框架中，在校准和区分能力上均超越强基线，并通过General Agent Calibrator (GAC)在跨域GAIA基准上实现了最佳校准。

Conclusion: HTC框架为AI代理的置信度校准设立了新的以过程为中心的范式，通过诊断和增强AI代理的可靠性，提供了可解释性、可迁移性和泛化性。

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

Method: 通过语料库证据和概念工程方法，分析了生成式AI对传统创造力理论的影响。

Result: 语料库证据显示作者和记者越来越倾向于将创造力归因于生成式AI，尽管其缺乏意向性代理；概念工程分析表明IAC已无法有效识别和鼓励可靠的新颖产品来源。

Conclusion: 作者主张在特定领域保留意向性代理条件（IAC），但在一般层面上应放弃这一条件，转而采用一致性要求，即创造力应追踪可靠生成新颖且有价值的产品。

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

Method: 引入ErrorMap方法，通过提取模型的“失败签名”来识别错误来源，并生成ErrorAtlas分类法，展示模型错误的重复模式。

Result: 应用ErrorMap到35个数据集和83个模型，生成ErrorAtlas，揭示了当前LLM研究中未被充分探索的错误类型。

Conclusion: ErrorMap和ErrorAtlas通过揭示LLM失败的根本原因，提供了更深入的评估层次，帮助开发者调试模型、对齐基准目标与结果，并支持明智的模型选择。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

Conclusion: EvoCUA通过自我进化的学习策略和可扩展的基础设施，显著提升了原生计算机使用代理的性能，并在OSWorld基准测试中取得了56.7%的成功率，超越了现有开源和闭源模型。

Abstract: The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行星表面通常使用自然语言中的高级语义概念进行分析，但大量的轨道图像档案仍以像素级别组织，这种不匹配限制了行星表面的可扩展、开放式探索。

Method: MarScope是一个行星尺度的视觉-语言框架，通过将行星图像和文本对齐在共享的语义空间中，训练了超过20万对精心策划的图像-文本对。

Result: 该框架在5秒内实现了对整个火星任意用户查询的灵活语义检索，F1得分高达0.978，并超越了形态分类，促进了过程导向的分析和基于相似性的行星尺度地貌映射。

Conclusion: MarScope通过将自然语言作为直接接口，为大规模地理空间数据集的科学发现建立了新范式，实现了无需标签的火星地貌映射。

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Motivation: 发现Decision Transformer中RTG序列的冗余设计，证明这种冗余会损害性能。

Method: 提出Decoupled DT (DDT)，简化了Decision Transformer的架构，仅处理观察和动作序列，并使用最新的RTG指导动作预测。

Result: 实验显示DDT显著优于DT，并在多个离线RL任务中与最先进的DT变体竞争。

Conclusion: Decoupled DT (DDT)通过简化架构，仅处理观察和动作序列并使用最新的RTG指导动作预测，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Method: 提出 CS-VAR（跨会话证据感知检索增强检测器），通过轻量级模型进行会话级风险推断，并由 LLM 指导训练，利用跨会话行为证据推理，将局部到全局的洞察传递给小模型。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集上的离线实验和在线验证表明，CS-VAR 具有最先进的性能，并提供可解释的局部信号，有效支持实际内容审核。

Conclusion: CS-VAR 通过结合轻量级模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的跨会话行为证据推理，实现了实时高效的直播风险评估，并在实验和实际应用中验证了其先进性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Method: 比较了零样本提示与使用静态、随机和基于嵌入的示例选择的一样本变体，并评估了清单驱动的验证器/校正器循环。

Result: 发现使用对齐示例的一样本提示表现最佳，而清单式自校正循环主要在零样本设置中提高可执行性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种可复现的Text2Cypher评估框架，支持在合成规划中进一步研究基于知识图谱的LLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning.

TL;DR: AgriPINN结合深度学习与生物物理模型，显著提升水分胁迫下作物生物量预测的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测水分胁迫下的作物地上生物量（AGB）对于监测作物生产力、指导灌溉和支持气候适应性农业至关重要。数据驱动模型缺乏可解释性且在分布变化下性能下降，而基于过程的作物模型需要大量校准且难以在大空间范围部署。

Method: AgriPINN是一种过程信息神经网络，将生物物理作物生长微分方程作为可微分约束集成到深度学习框架中。

Result: AgriPINN在精度（RMSE降低高达43%）和计算效率上均优于最先进的深度学习基线（ConvLSTM-ViT、SLTF、CNN-Transformer）和基于过程的LINTUL5模型。

Conclusion: AgriPINN通过结合深度学习的可扩展性和基于过程的生物物理模型的严谨性，为时空AGB预测提供了一个稳健且可解释的框架，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于手工启发式策略的节点选择方法在不同MILP问题实例上表现不稳定且不可预测，因此需要自动化学习节点选择策略以提高求解效率。

Method: DeepBound采用多级特征融合网络捕获节点表示，并通过成对训练范式解决分支定界树中的节点不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个NP难MILP基准测试中，DeepBound相比传统启发式规则和现有学习型方法表现出更优的求解效率，显著减少计算时间并获得最优可行解。

Conclusion: DeepBound通过深度学习自动化学习节点选择策略，显著提升了MILP问题的求解效率，并展示了强大的泛化能力，有望替代传统人工设计的启发式规则。

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

Motivation: 探索显式情感动态在塑造长视野代理行为中的作用，以解决LLM代理在长时间交互中表现出的语气和角色突然变化的问题。

Method: 引入了一个代理级情感子系统，该系统维护一个连续的VAD状态，并通过一阶和二阶更新规则进行管理。瞬时情感信号通过固定的无记忆估计器提取，并通过指数平滑或基于动量的动态进行时间整合。

Result: 无状态代理无法表现出连贯的轨迹或恢复，而状态持久性则实现了延迟响应和可靠的恢复。二阶动态引入了情感惯性和滞后效应，随着动量的增加而增加。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过对外部情感状态施加动态结构，可以在多轮对话中诱导时间连贯性和可控恢复。特别是二阶动态引入了情感惯性和滞后效应，揭示了稳定性和响应性之间的权衡。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Motivation: 气候虚假信息在数字世界中日益严重，尤其是社交媒体上广泛传播的误导性图像和视频。现有的视觉语言模型仅依赖训练时的知识，难以应对近期事件或更新。

Method: 通过检索最新的反向图像结果、在线事实核查和可信专家内容等外部知识，结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）来评估图像及其声明的准确性。

Result: 该方法提高了模型处理现实世界气候虚假信息的能力，能更准确地判断图像及其声明是否为准确、误导、虚假或无法验证。

Conclusion: 结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）与外部知识检索，可以有效提升对气候虚假信息的识别能力，支持在快速变化的信息环境中保护公众对科学的理解。

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种系统化评估和改进提示设计的方法，为教育技术研究者提供了从临时提示工程转向基于证据的提示开发的路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

Conclusion: 即使经过强化学习训练的高性能定理证明器，在推理时仍能从简单的结构指导中获益，这是一种低成本且互补的提升方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Abstract: Social robots are increasingly applied as health behavior change interventions, yet actionable knowledge to guide their design and evaluation remains limited. This systematic review synthesizes (1) the behavior change strategies used in existing HRI studies employing social robots to promote health behavior change, and (2) the evaluation methods applied to assess behavior change outcomes. Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics. The review also identified key characteristics of current evaluation practices, including study designs, settings, durations, and outcome measures, on the basis of which we propose several directions for future HRI research.

Abstract: In narrow, unstructured underwater environments such as environmental monitoring and minimally invasive medical procedures, micro soft robots exhibit unique advantages due to their flexible movement capabilities and small size. At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced. This study demonstrates a method for magnetically driven micro soft robots, laying a foundation for the application of wireless-driven robots in underwater narrow spaces.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for cross-embodiment humanoid robot control by learning a shared latent representation that unifies motion across humans and diverse humanoid platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and legged humanoid robots. Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer. The learned latent policies can also be directly applied to the new robots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables robust, scalable, and embodiment-agnostic robot control across a wide range of humanoid platforms.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated framework for enhancing the safety and operational efficiency of robotic arms in laparoscopic surgery by addressing key challenges in collision detection and minimum distance estimation. By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining analytical precision with machine learning algorithms to enhance the precision and reliability of robotic systems.

Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for drone control can have a transformative impact on drone capabilities, especially when real world information can be integrated with drone sensing, command, and control, part of a growing field of physical AI. Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information. This demonstrates a universal approach to integration of LLMs with drone command and control, a paradigm that leverages and exploits virtually all of modern AI industry with drone technology in an easy to use interface that translates natural language to drone control.

TL;DR: CompliantVLA-adaptor通过VLM-informed VIC控制提升接触密集型机器人任务的安全性和成功率，成功率翻倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA系统（如RDT、Pi0、OpenVLA-oft）仅输出位置信息，缺乏力感知适应能力，导致在涉及接触、柔顺性或不确定性的物理任务中出现不安全或失败的情况。

Method: 提出CompliantVLA-adaptor，利用VLM从图像和自然语言中解析任务上下文，动态调整VIC控制器的刚度和阻尼参数，并通过实时力/力矩反馈进一步调节以确保安全。

Result: 在仿真和实际硬件测试中，该方法优于VLA基线，任务总成功率从9.86%提升至17.29%，且力违规情况减少。

Conclusion: CompliantVLA-adaptor通过结合VLM-informed context-aware VIC控制，显著提升了接触密集型机器人操作任务的安全性和成功率，为VLA模型在物理任务中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a CompliantVLA-adaptor that augments the state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with vision-language model (VLM)-informed context-aware variable impedance control (VIC) to improve the safety and effectiveness of contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, Pi0, OpenVLA-oft) typically output position, but lack force-aware adaptation, leading to unsafe or failed interactions in physical tasks involving contact, compliance, or uncertainty. In the proposed CompliantVLA-adaptor, a VLM interprets task context from images and natural language to adapt the stiffness and damping parameters of a VIC controller. These parameters are further regulated using real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the VLA baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware, with improved success rates and reduced force violations. The overall success rate across all tasks increases from 9.86\% to 17.29\%, presenting a promising path towards safe contact-rich manipulation using VLAs. We release our code, prompts, and force-torque-impedance-scenario context datasets at https://sites.google.com/view/compliantvla.

Abstract: Targeted drug delivery in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract using magnetic robots offers a promising alternative to systemic treatments. However, controlling these robots is a major challenge. Stationary magnetic systems have a limited workspace, while mobile systems (e.g., coils on a robotic arm) suffer from a "model-calibration bottleneck", requiring complex, pre-calibrated physical models that are time-consuming to create and computationally expensive. This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path. We also demonstrated successful tracking over a clinically relevant, 30 cm * 20 cm workspace. This work demonstrates a rapidly deployable, model-free control framework capable of precise magnetic manipulation in a large workspace,validated using a 2D GI phantom.

Motivation: 随着环境灾害频率和严重性的增加，利用羽流追踪寻找污染物或有害颗粒源头变得尤为重要。小型四旋翼飞行器上的羽流追踪使其能够在人类周围和更狭窄的空间中操作，但受限于传感器的灵敏度和响应时间。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来平台奠定了基础，这些平台可以结合气流传感器与其他传感器，实现更丰富的羽流追踪数据收集和源头寻找。

Abstract: As environmental disasters happen more frequently and severely, seeking the source of pollutants or harmful particulates using plume tracking becomes even more important. Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究空中平台在3D运动能力下的物体目标导航（ObjectNav），以解决空间感知、动态控制和安全性等新挑战。

Method: AION是一个端到端的双策略强化学习（RL）框架，将探索和目标到达行为解耦为两个专门化的策略。

Conclusion: AION框架在探索、导航效率和安全性方面表现出色，展示了在无外部定位或全局地图的情况下实现空中物体目标导航的潜力。

Abstract: Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires an agent to autonomously explore an unknown environment and navigate toward target objects specified by a semantic label. While prior work has primarily studied zero-shot ObjectNav under 2D locomotion, extending it to aerial platforms with 3D locomotion capability remains underexplored. Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models. Experimental results show that AION achieves superior performance across comprehensive evaluation metrics in exploration, navigation efficiency, and safety.

Motivation: 多自由度康复机器人的精确对齐对安全和有效的患者训练至关重要，因此需要高效的校准方法。

Method: 论文开发了一种基于Kronecker积的开环校准方法，将输入输出对齐转化为线性参数识别问题，并通过PPO代理在仿真中选择信息量大的姿势。

Result: 仿真和实际机器人评估表明，PPO选择的姿势组合信息量显著高于随机选择，参数估计的交叉预测一致性更强。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的两阶段校准框架显著提高了多自由度康复机器人的校准效率，同时保持了稳健的参数估计，为高精度对齐提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robots is essential for safe and effective patient training. This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在多模态运动规划中表现出色，但在实际部署中难以强制车辆动力学，且高度依赖对其他代理的准确预测，导致在不确定交互下存在安全隐患。

Method: 采用Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)可达性值函数作为主动引导和反应性安全屏障，结合控制屏障值函数(CBVFs)修改执行动作以确保安全。

Result: 在具有挑战性的无保护U形转弯场景中，DualShield相比其他领先方法在不确定条件下显著提高了安全性和任务效率。

Conclusion: DualShield框架通过结合Hamilton-Jacobi可达性值函数，在保持扩散模型丰富探索能力的同时，提供了在不确定甚至对抗性交互下的安全保证，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的安全性和任务效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for multimodal motion planning in autonomous driving. However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.

Conclusion: Glove2UAV通过手势控制和触觉反馈实现了直观的无人机操控，验证了实时操作的可行性，并展示了稳定的性能和及时的警告提示。

Abstract: This paper presents Glove2UAV, a wearable IMU-glove interface for intuitive UAV control through hand and finger gestures, augmented with vibrotactile warnings for exceeding predefined speed thresholds. To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用信标网络和分层规划器实现UUV在GNSS拒止环境中隐蔽导航的方法，确保了舰队的精确定位和路径优化。

Abstract: Autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) enable military and civilian covert operations in coastal areas without relying on support vessels or Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore. These beacons either submerged or floating emit acoustic signals for UUV localisation and navigation. A hierarchical planner generates an adaptive route for the drones executing primitive actions while continuously monitoring and replanning as needed to maintain trajectory accuracy.

Conclusion: TeNet通过文本条件超网络提供了一种实用方法，为资源受限且需实时控制的机器人任务构建紧凑的语言驱动控制器。

Abstract: Robots that follow natural-language instructions often either plan at a high level using hand-designed interfaces or rely on large end-to-end models that are difficult to deploy for real-time control. We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.

Conclusion: LM-Calibr和EVA-LIO方法有效解决了旋转驱动LiDAR系统的标定和定位问题，支持多种安装配置并提升扫描完整性和定位鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate calibration and robust localization are fundamental for downstream tasks in spinning actuated LiDAR applications. Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

Conclusion: PUMA框架通过端到端学习，成功整合了视觉感知和立足点先验，显著提升了四足机器人在复杂地形中的敏捷性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parkour tasks for quadrupeds have emerged as a promising benchmark for agile locomotion. While human athletes can effectively perceive environmental characteristics to select appropriate footholds for obstacle traversal, endowing legged robots with similar perceptual reasoning remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on hierarchical controllers that follow pre-computed footholds, thereby constraining the robot's real-time adaptability and the exploratory potential of reinforcement learning. To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks. Extensive experiments conducted in simulation and real-world environments across various discrete complex terrains, demonstrate PUMA's exceptional agility and robustness in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的HumanoidPF方法有效解决了人形机器人在杂乱室内场景中的无碰撞穿越问题，并通过实验验证了其仿真到现实的微小差距。

Abstract: We study the problem of collision-free humanoid traversal in cluttered indoor scenes, such as hurdling over objects scattered on the floor, crouching under low-hanging obstacles, or squeezing through narrow passages. To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the effectiveness of our method. Demos and code can be found in our website: https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/.

Conclusion: DextER通过引入基于接触的具身推理，显著提升了语言驱动的灵巧抓取生成性能，实现了更高的成功率和意图对齐。

Abstract: Language-driven dexterous grasp generation requires the models to understand task semantics, 3D geometry, and complex hand-object interactions. While vision-language models have been applied to this problem, existing approaches directly map observations to grasp parameters without intermediate reasoning about physical interactions. We present DextER, Dexterous Grasp Generation with Embodied Reasoning, which introduces contact-based embodied reasoning for multi-finger manipulation. Our key insight is that predicting which hand links contact where on the object surface provides an embodiment-aware intermediate representation bridging task semantics with physical constraints. DextER autoregressively generates embodied contact tokens specifying which finger links contact where on the object surface, followed by grasp tokens encoding the hand configuration. On DexGYS, DextER achieves 67.14% success rate, outperforming state-of-the-art by 3.83%p with 96.4% improvement in intention alignment. We also demonstrate steerable generation through partial contact specification, providing fine-grained control over grasp synthesis.

Abstract: One of core advantages of the SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame. Therefore, a construction method for SE2(3) group navigation models is proposed, which brings the navigation models closer to full autonomy.

Motivation: 解决双足机器人在现实世界中因动力学建模不准确和传感器噪声带来的不确定性挑战。

Method: 采用基于模型的控制策略（DCM轨迹规划和全身控制器）作为基础策略，并通过带领域随机化的强化学习训练残差策略，利用特权信息（模型先知策略）监督残差策略的学习。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合模型控制和强化学习的框架，显著提升了双足机器人在不确定环境中的行走鲁棒性和适应性，为仿真到现实的迁移提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a control framework that integrates model-based bipedal locomotion with residual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve robust and adaptive walking in the presence of real-world uncertainties. Our approach leverages a model-based controller, comprising a Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) trajectory planner and a whole-body controller, as a reliable base policy. To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion.

TL;DR: IVRA通过注入亲和力信号提升VLA模型的空间理解能力，无需训练即可在2D/3D任务中稳定提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型将图像块展平为1D标记序列，削弱了精确操作所需的2D空间线索。

Method: IVRA在推理时选择性注入亲和力信号到语言模型层，重新对齐视觉-标记交互，同时保持所有模型参数不变。

Result: 在2D VIMA上，IVRA在低数据环境下比基线LLaRA平均成功率提升+4.2%；在3D LIBERO上，即使基线准确率接近饱和（96.3%至97.1%），仍能实现一致增益。

Conclusion: IVRA作为一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，通过利用模型内置视觉编码器中已有的亲和力提示，显著提升了空间理解能力，适用于多种VLA架构，并在2D和3D操作任务中展现出稳定的性能提升。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%). All code and models will be released publicly. Visualizations are available at: jongwoopark7978.github.io/IVRA

Conclusion: Point Bridge框架通过统一的、领域无关的基于点的表示，成功实现了零样本从模拟到现实的策略迁移，显著提升了性能，尤其是在结合少量真实数据后表现更优。

Abstract: Robot foundation models are beginning to deliver on the promise of generalist robotic agents, yet progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale real-world manipulation datasets. Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效算法，通过嵌套嵌入的组合，实现了度量空间到HSTs的概率性嵌入，改进了buy-at-bulk和dial-a-ride问题的近似解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在度量空间中高效地嵌入点集到HSTs和超度量空间中，同时控制异常点集的大小和嵌入的预期失真，以改进现有算法的近似解。

Method: 利用嵌套嵌入的组合概念，将确定性嵌入扩展到概率性嵌入的设定中。通过结合[Chawla and Sheridan 2024]提出的嵌套嵌入和[Munagala et al. 2023]的近似算法，实现了高效的嵌入过程。

Result: 提出了一种算法，能够以最多$O(\frac{k}{ε}\log^2k)$个异常点和最多$(32+ε)c$的失真，对度量空间进行概率性嵌入。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的算法，用于将度量空间中的点集嵌入到HSTs和超度量空间中，通过引入异常点集的概念，实现了较低的预期失真。这一方法不仅改进了HST嵌入的应用，还为buy-at-bulk和dial-a-ride问题提供了更好的实例特定近似解。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider outlier embeddings into HSTs and ultrametrics. In particular, for $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (i.e. the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\frac k ε\log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+ε)c$, for any $ε>0$. This leads to better instance-specific approximations for certain instances of the buy-at-bulk and dial-a-ride problems, whose current best approximation algorithms go through HST embeddings.
  In order to facilitate our results, we largely focus on the concept of compositions of nested embeddings introduced by [Chawla and Sheridan 2024]. A nested embedding is a composition of two embeddings of a metric space $(X,d)$ -- a low distortion embedding of a subset $S$ of nodes, and a higher distortion embedding of the entire metric. The composition is a single embedding that preserves the low distortion over $S$ and does not increase distortion over the remaining points by much. In this paper, we expand this concept from the setting of deterministic embeddings to the setting of probabilistic embeddings. We show how to find good nested compositions of embeddings into HSTs, and combine this with an approximation algorithm of [Munagala et al. 2023] to obtain our results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯分布的均值估计在PDP下面临独特挑战：数据值无界导致元素贡献差异大，需同时考虑隐私信息和数据值；无界PDP中隐私信息保护进一步增加了权重计算的难度。

Method: 通过推导有界和无界PDP设置中的理论下界，并设计匹配这些下界的算法上界（至多对数因子差距）。

Result: 提出的高斯均值估计器在有界和无界PDP中均达到最优性能（对数因子内），解决了现有工作仅覆盖有界分布的问题。

Conclusion: 本文针对高斯分布下的均值估计问题，在个性化差分隐私（PDP）框架下提出了最优估计器，分别在有界和无界PDP设置中达到了与理论下界匹配的性能（对数因子内）。

Abstract: We study mean estimation for Gaussian distributions under \textit{personalized differential privacy} (PDP), where each record has its own privacy budget. PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \textit{bounded} and \textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

TL;DR: 扩展MGREEDY和TGREEDY算法至SCS-RC问题，分别获得3.75和2.875的近似比，首次改进该问题的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCS-RC问题在生物信息学中自然出现，但此前在反向互补设置下的近似比改进未有进展。

Method: 扩展了标准的MGREEDY和TGREEDY算法，通过处理反向互补引入的双向重叠，改进了近似比。

Result: MGREEDY和TGREEDY的扩展版本分别达到了3.75和2.875的近似比，其中2.875是目前该问题的最佳已知界限。

Conclusion: 本研究通过扩展MGREEDY和TGREEDY算法到反向互补设置，分别实现了3.75和2.875的近似比，为SCS-RC问题提供了首个正式的近似保证改进。

Abstract: The Shortest Common Superstring (SCS) problem asks for the shortest string that contains each of a given set of strings as a substring. Its reverse-complement variant, the Shortest Common Superstring problem with Reverse Complements (SCS-RC), naturally arises in bioinformatics applications, where for each input string, either the string itself or its reverse complement must appear as a substring of the superstring. The well-known MGREEDY algorithm for the standard SCS constructs a superstring by first computing an optimal cycle cover on the overlap graph and then concatenating the strings corresponding to the cycles, while its refined variant, TGREEDY, further improves the approximation ratio. Although the original 4- and 3-approximation bounds of these algorithms have been successively improved for the standard SCS, no such progress has been made for the reverse-complement setting. A previous study extended MGREEDY to SCS-RC with a 4-approximation guarantee and briefly suggested that extending TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting could achieve a 3-approximation. In this work, we strengthen these results by proving that the extensions of MGREEDY and TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting achieve 3.75- and 2.875-approximation ratios, respectively. Our analysis extends the classical proofs for the standard SCS to handle the bidirectional overlaps introduced by reverse complements. These results provide the first formal improvement of approximation guarantees for SCS-RC, with the 2.875-approximate algorithm currently representing the best known bound for this problem.

Motivation: Lima等人的算法在树独立数较大时复杂度急剧增加，无法实用。本文旨在优化这一算法，使其在树独立数较大时仍能高效运行。

Method: 通过改进Lima等人的算法，本文展示了如何在树独立数有界的情况下，以时间n^O(k)解决同一类问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进算法，能够在树独立数有界的情况下，以准多项式或次指数时间解决一类优化问题，适用于多种图形类。

Abstract: The independence number of a tree decomposition is the size of a largest independent set contained in a single bag. The tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of $G$. As shown recently by Lima et al. [ESA~2024], a large family of optimization problems asking for a maximum-weight induced subgraph of bounded treewidth, satisfying a given \textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property, can be solved in polynomial time in graphs whose tree-independence number is bounded by some constant~$k$.
  However, the complexity of the algorithm of Lima et al. grows rapidly with $k$, making it useless if the tree-independence number is superconstant. In this paper we present a refined version of the algorithm. We show that the same family of problems can be solved in time~$n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the instance, $k$ is the tree-independence number, and the $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on the treewidth bound of the solution and the considered \textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property.
  This running time is quasipolynomial for classes of graphs with polylogarithmic tree-independence number; several such classes were recently discovered. Furthermore, the running time is subexponential for many natural classes of geometric intersection graphs -- namely, ones that admit balanced clique-based separators of sublinear size.

TL;DR: 本文提出动态模式匹配的高效算法，适用于含通配符的模式，实现亚线性复杂度，并通过条件性下界和特殊案例优化验证其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态模式匹配问题在实际应用中广泛存在，但现有方法在模式包含通配符时效率不足。本文旨在设计高效算法，以应对文本和模式动态更新的场景。

Method: 设计了基于O(nlog^2 n)预处理时间和O(knk/k+1 + k2 log n)更新/查询时间的算法。针对特殊案例（如模式中w个非通配符或最多两个非通配符），分别提出了O(nw)预处理/O(w + log n)更新时间和O(n^1.8)预处理/O(n^0.8 log n)更新时间的优化算法。

Result: 算法在k为常数或k=o(log n)时实现亚线性复杂度。条件性下界表明，k=Ω(log n)时亚线性更新时间与SETH假设矛盾。特殊案例中，算法进一步优化至真正亚线性时间。

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对动态模式匹配问题的高效算法，适用于模式中包含最多k个通配符的情况。算法在预处理和更新/查询时间上均实现了亚线性复杂度，并针对k的不同范围提供了具体优化。此外，通过条件性下界证明了在k=Ω(log n)时，亚线性更新时间与SETH假设的矛盾。

Abstract: We study the fully dynamic pattern matching problem where the pattern may contain up to kwildcard symbols, each matching any symbol of the alphabet. Both the text and the pattern are subject to updates (insert, delete, change). We design an algorithm with O(nlog^2 n) preprocessing and update/query time O(knk/k+1 + k2 log n). The bound is truly sublinear for a constant k, and sublinear when k= o(log n). We further complement our results with a conditional lower bound: assuming subquadratic preprocessing time, achieving truly sublinear update time for the case k = Ω(log n) would contradict the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Finally, we develop sublinear algorithms for two special cases: - If the pattern contains w non-wildcard symbols, we give an algorithm with preprocessing time O(nw) and update time O(w + log n), which is truly sublinear whenever wis truly sublinear. - Using FFT technique combined with block decomposition, we design a deterministic truly sublinear algorithm with preprocessing time O(n^1.8) and update time O(n^0.8 log n) for the case that there are at most two non-wildcards.

Conclusion: 该软件解决方案通过使用Nvidia的IPC API，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）与传统基于网格的渲染管线集成困难的问题，为交互式应用和艺术探索提供了便利。

Abstract: Radiance field-based rendering methods have attracted significant interest from the computer vision and computer graphics communities. They enable high-fidelity rendering with complex real-world lighting effects, but at the cost of high rendering time. 3D Gaussian Splatting solves this issue with a rasterisation-based approach for real-time rendering, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, and extended reality. However, current 3DGS implementations are difficult to integrate into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines, which is a common use case for interactive applications and artistic exploration. To address this limitation, this software solution uses Nvidia's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to easily integrate into implementations and allow the results to be viewed in external clients such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers.

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种算法，分别用于最大化无人机与地面基站（RBS）和高空平台（HAP）链路的容量，以及确保所有链路的公平性。仿真验证了这两种算法的性能。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi- connectivity (MC) capabilities efficiently and reliably transfer data between terrestrial networks (TNs) and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links. We validate the performance of both algorithms through simulation

Conclusion: 该论文为下一代数字孪生生态系统奠定了基础，并为未来6G系统中驱动多模态智能的新型ML基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in mobile and wireless networks are unlocking the full potential of robotic autonomy, enabling robots to take advantage of ultra-low latency, high data throughput, and ubiquitous connectivity. However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Radio-Frequency (RF) signals is essential for reliable wearable health-monitoring systems, providing awareness of the interference conditions in which medical protocols operate. In the overcrowded 2.4 GHz ISM band, however, identifying low-power transmissions from medical sensors is challenging due to strong co-channel interference and substantial power asymmetry with coexisting technologies. This work introduces the first open source framework for automatic recognition of SmartBAN signals in Body Area Networks (BANs). The framework combines a synthetic dataset of simulated signals with real RF acquisitions obtained through Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), enabling both controlled and realistic evaluation. Deep convolutional neural networks based on ResNet encoders and U-Net decoders with attention mechanisms are trained and assessed across diverse propagation conditions. The proposed approach achieves over 90% accuracy on synthetic datasets and demonstrates consistent performance on real over-the-air spectrograms. By enabling reliable SmartBAN signal recognition in dense spectral environments, this framework supports interferenceaware coexistence strategies and improves the dependability of wearable healthcare systems.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出ACI框架，通过非短视调度分摊切换延迟，理论证明其吞吐量最优性，并在多无人机网络中验证其有效性，同时展示吞吐量-延迟权衡的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态资源分配方案（如Max-Weight策略）因忽略切换延迟而性能受限，尤其在延迟随机且非均匀时更明显。ACI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文首先利用Lyapunov漂移分析证明了基于积压驱动的ACI在缩放容量区域内的吞吐量最优性，随后在多无人机网络与FSO回程中验证了ACI的有效性。

Result: ACI在理论分析和实验验证中均表现出色，能够适应吞吐量与延迟的权衡需求。

Conclusion: ACI框架通过非短视、基于帧的调度策略有效分摊了切换延迟，证明了其在吞吐量优化方面的有效性，并展示了其在吞吐量与延迟权衡中的灵活性。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation to parallel queues is a cornerstone of network scheduling, yet classical solutions often fail when accounting for the overhead of switching delays to queues with superior link conditions. In particular, system performance is further degraded when switching delays are stochastic and inhomogeneous. In this domain, the myopic, Max-Weight policy struggles, as it is agnostic to switching delays. This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate how adapting its core urgency metric provides the flexibility to navigate the throughput-latency trade-off.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的交替优化方法（LLM-AOA），用于解决低空多无人机辅助数据收集和语义转发网络中的多目标优化问题，显著提升了传输速率和语义速率，并降低了无人机能耗。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging economic paradigm which fosters integrated development across multiple fields. As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\% and 22.9\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.

TL;DR: ToolCaching是一个针对LLM工具调用系统的自适应缓存框架，通过VAAC算法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM工具调用系统中存在冗余或重复请求的问题，传统缓存策略因请求语义异构、动态负载和新鲜度需求多样而失效。

Method: 提出了ToolCaching框架，结合语义和系统级特征评估请求的缓存价值和可行性，并设计了VAAC算法进行动态缓存管理。

Result: 在合成和公共工具调用工作负载上的实验显示，ToolCaching比标准策略缓存命中率提高11%，延迟降低34%。

Conclusion: ToolCaching与VAAC算法在LLM工具调用系统中显著提升了缓存命中率和降低了延迟，验证了其在实际应用中的高效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized web applications, enabling intelligent search, recommendation, and assistant services with natural language interfaces. Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个多语言语音驱动的代码理解框架，解决了语音查询中的代码相关挑战，显著提升了转录和代码理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码理解系统主要面向英语用户和键盘交互，限制了多语言和语音优先环境中的可访问性，尤其是在印度等地区。语音界面虽然更具包容性，但涉及代码的语音查询存在非标准英语用法、领域特定词汇和自定义标识符等独特挑战。

Method: 开发了一个多语言语音驱动的代码理解框架，包括使用自动语音识别（ASR）转录用户母语的语音查询，应用基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的代码感知ASR输出细化，并通过CodeSearchNet、CoRNStack和CodeQA等基准与代码模型接口执行代码问答和代码检索任务。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了语音界面中代码敏感适配的必要性，并提供了一个实用的解决方案，用于构建健壮的多语言语音驱动编程工具。

Abstract: Code understanding is a foundational capability in software engineering tools and developer workflows. However, most existing systems are designed for English-speaking users interacting via keyboards, which limits accessibility in multilingual and voice-first settings, particularly in regions like India. Voice-based interfaces offer a more inclusive modality, but spoken queries involving code present unique challenges due to the presence of non-standard English usage, domain-specific vocabulary, and custom identifiers such as variable and function names, often combined with code-mixed expressions. In this work, we develop a multilingual speech-driven framework for code understanding that accepts spoken queries in a user native language, transcribes them using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applies code-aware ASR output refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs), and interfaces with code models to perform tasks such as code question answering and code retrieval through benchmarks such as CodeSearchNet, CoRNStack, and CodeQA. Focusing on four widely spoken Indic languages and English, we systematically characterize how transcription errors impact downstream task performance. We also identified key failure modes in ASR for code and demonstrated that LLM-guided refinement significantly improves performance across both transcription and code understanding stages. Our findings underscore the need for code-sensitive adaptations in speech interfaces and offer a practical solution for building robust, multilingual voice-driven programming tools.

TL;DR: 研究提出基于本地LLMs的提示框架，用于检测Python代码中的循环漏洞，Phi模型表现优于LLaMA，强调有效提示设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环漏洞是软件开发中的主要风险构造，传统静态分析工具依赖语法模式难以检测语义缺陷，而LLMs因其上下文理解能力为漏洞检测提供了新潜力。本地LLMs解决了隐私、延迟和依赖等问题。

Method: 研究提出了一个基于提示的框架，利用本地部署的LLMs（LLaMA 3.2; 3B和Phi 3.5; 4B）通过迭代提示指导其行为，检测Python 3.7+代码中的循环漏洞。框架包含语言特定意识、代码感知基础、版本敏感性和幻觉预防等关键保护功能。

Conclusion: 研究发现，设计有效的提示对于本地LLMs进行安全准确的代码漏洞分析至关重要，Phi模型在精确度、召回率和F1分数上优于LLaMA。

Abstract: Loop vulnerabilities are one major risky construct in software development. They can easily lead to infinite loops or executions, exhaust resources, or introduce logical errors that degrade performance and compromise security. The problem are often undetected by traditional static analyzers because such tools rely on syntactic patterns, which makes them struggle to detect semantic flaws. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for vulnerability detection because of their ability to understand code contextually. Moreover, local LLMs unlike commercial ones like ChatGPT or Gemini addresses issues such as privacy, latency, and dependency concerns by facilitating efficient offline analysis. Consequently, this study proposes a prompt-based framework that utilize local LLMs for the detection of loop vulnerabilities within Python 3.7+ code. The framework targets three categories of loop-related issues, such as control and logic errors, security risks inside loops, and resource management inefficiencies. A generalized and structured prompt-based framework was designed and tested with two locally deployed LLMs (LLaMA 3.2; 3B and Phi 3.5; 4B) by guiding their behavior via iterative prompting. The designed prompt-based framework included key safeguarding features such as language-specific awareness, code-aware grounding, version sensitivity, and hallucination prevention. The LLM results were validated against a manually established baseline truth, and the results indicate that Phi outperforms LLaMA in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings emphasize the importance of designing effective prompts for local LLMs to perform secure and accurate code vulnerability analysis.

Conclusion: Centaur 是一种创新的神经符号技术，通过动态学习输入约束来测试深度学习库 API，显著提高了测试的有效性和多样性，成功检测出多个新 bug。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) libraries (e.g., PyTorch) are popular in AI development. These libraries are complex and contain bugs. Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.
  To address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.
  We develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.
  We evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively. Using Centaur, we also detect 26 new bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 18 of which are confirmed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有TAP平台在自然语言预测中生成非可执行小程序的问题，专注于功能级配置问题。

Method: FARM采用两阶段架构：第一阶段训练对比双编码器，检索候选触发和动作函数；第二阶段使用基于LLM的多智能体流程进行选择和配置。

Result: FARM在功能级别上达到81%的联合准确率（噪声数据62%，单次学习70%），并在服务级别上比TARGE提升23个百分点。

Conclusion: FARM模型在功能级别上实现了81%的联合准确率，显著优于现有基线，并能生成可执行的自动化配置。

Abstract: Trigger-Action Programming (TAP) platforms such as IFTTT and Zapier enable Web of Things (WoT) automation by composing event-driven rules across heterogeneous services. A TAP applet links a trigger to an action and must bind trigger outputs (ingredients) to action inputs (fields) to be executable. Prior work largely treats TAP as service-level prediction from natural language, which often yields non-executable applets that still require manual configuration. We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level. FARM reaches 81% joint accuracy and improves over TARGE by 23 percentage points. FARM also generates ingredient-to-field bindings, producing executable automation configurations.

Conclusion: 研究团队提出了首个指令引导的代码补全基准C3-Bench，并开发了数据合成流程和模型Qwen2.5-Coder-C3，其在C3-Bench上表现优异。所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Code completion has become a central task, gaining significant attention with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based tools in software engineering. Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing LLMs' code completion and instruction-following capabilities, establishing new directions for future research in code LLMs. To facilitate reproducibility and foster further research in code LLMs, we open-source all code, datasets, and models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估UML序列图与文本结合是否比纯文本更能提高需求检查的准确性，并探讨认知能力（如工作记忆和心智旋转技能）对检查效果的影响。

Method: 采用交叉实验设计，38名参与者分别在纯文本和文本加UML支持两种条件下进行需求检查，使用线性混合效应和广义线性模型分析数据。

Result: 发现表示类型、工作记忆容量和心智旋转能力之间存在显著的三重交互作用。高认知能力者在使用UML时违规检测表现下降，但在理由准确性上表现提升。

Conclusion: UML序列图的使用效果因人而异，高认知能力者在某些任务中表现下降，但在深层推理任务中表现提升。

Abstract: The representation of requirements plays a critical role in the accuracy of requirements inspection. While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection. Conversely, the same cognitive profile was associated with improved justification accuracy under UML-aided inspection, indicating that higher cognitive abilities may support deeper reasoning processes when dealing with multi-modal information, i.e., diagrams and text.

Result: 研究发现从业者未系统化处理PbD，因此提出目标导向的评估方法。

Conclusion: 作者建议，隐私设计（PbD）的需求工程（RE）方法应基于组织目标而非仅流程特性进行评估，并希望目标导向方法能支持PbD的RE实践开发、选择和定制。

Abstract: Implementing privacy by design (PbD) according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is met with a growing number of requirements engineering (RE) approaches. However, the question of which RE method for PbD fits best the goals of organisations remains a challenge. We report our endeavor to close this gap by synthesizing a goal-centric approach for PbD methods assessment. We used literature review, interviews, and validation with practitioners to achieve the goal of our study. As practitioners do not approach PbD systematically, we suggest that RE methods for PbD should be assessed against organisational goals, rather than process characteristics only. We hope that, when further developed, the goal-centric approach could support the development, selection, and tailoring of RE practices for PbD.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based question-answering systems offer significant potential for automating customer support and internal knowledge access in small businesses, yet their practical deployment remains challenging due to infrastructure costs, engineering complexity, and security risks, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based settings. This paper presents an industry case study of an open-source, multi-tenant platform that enables small businesses to deploy customised LLM-based support chatbots via a no-code workflow. The platform is built on distributed, lightweight k3s clusters spanning heterogeneous, low-cost machines and interconnected through an encrypted overlay network, enabling cost-efficient resource pooling while enforcing container-based isolation and per-tenant data access controls. In addition, the platform integrates practical, platform-level defences against prompt injection attacks in RAG-based chatbots, translating insights from recent prompt injection research into deployable security mechanisms without requiring model retraining or enterprise-scale infrastructure. We evaluate the proposed platform through a real-world e-commerce deployment, demonstrating that secure and efficient LLM-based chatbot services can be achieved under realistic cost, operational, and security constraints faced by small businesses.

TL;DR: 本文提出三种优化RT Cores在粒子FRNN模拟中性能的方法，包括BVH优化、无邻居列表变体和周期性边界条件支持，实验显示显著加速和内存效率提升，同时明确了传统GPU的优势场景。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进一步优化基于RT Cores的粒子FRNN物理模拟性能，解决现有方法在动态适应性、内存占用和边界条件支持上的局限性。

Method: i) BVH结构的实时更新/重建比优化器；ii) 两种无需邻居列表的RT Core使用变体；iii) 支持周期性边界条件的RT Core技术。实验采用Lennard-Jones FRNN相互作用模型作为案例研究。

Result: BVH优化器使RT Core管道速度提升至$\sim 3.4\times$；两种变体在小半径和正态半径分布下分别实现$\sim1.3\times$和$\sim2.0\times$的加速；周期性边界条件技术无显著性能损失。方法在GPU世代间具有良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的三种方法显著提升了RT Cores在粒子FRNN物理模拟中的性能，包括BVH结构的实时更新/重建比优化、无需邻居列表的两种RT Core使用变体，以及支持周期性边界条件的RT Core技术。这些方法在不同GPU世代中均表现出良好的性能和能效扩展性，同时也明确了传统GPU计算仍占优势的模拟场景。

Abstract: In this work we introduce three ideas that can further improve particle FRNN physics simulations running on RT Cores; i) a real-time update/rebuild ratio optimizer for the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) structure, ii) a new RT core use, with two variants, that eliminates the need of a neighbor list and iii) a technique that enables RT cores for FRNN with periodic boundary conditions (BC). Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\sim 3.4\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\sim1.3\times$ at small radius to $\sim2.0\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores.
