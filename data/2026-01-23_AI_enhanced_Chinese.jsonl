They enable high-fidelity rendering with complex real-world lighting effects, but at the cost of high rendering time. 3D Gaussian Splatting solves this issue with a rasterisation-based approach for real-time rendering, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, and extended reality. However, current 3DGS implementations are difficult to integrate into traditional mesh-based rendering pipelines, which is a common use case for interactive applications and artistic exploration. To address this limitation, this software solution uses Nvidia's interprocess communication (IPC) APIs to easily integrate into implementations and allow the results to be viewed in external clients such as Unity, Blender, Unreal Engine, and OpenGL viewers.

Tool-calling extends LLMs with the ability to interact with external APIs, greatly enhancing their practical utility. While prior research has improved tool-calling performance by adopting traditional computer systems techniques, such as parallel and asynchronous execution, the challenge of redundant or repeated tool-calling requests remains largely unaddressed. Caching is a classic solution to this problem, but applying it to LLM tool-calling introduces new difficulties due to heterogeneous request semantics, dynamic workloads, and varying freshness requirements, which render conventional cache policies ineffective. To address these issues, we propose ToolCaching, an efficient feature-driven and adaptive caching framework for LLM tool-calling systems. ToolCaching systematically integrates semantic and system-level features to evaluate request cacheability and estimate caching value. At its core, the VAAC algorithm integrates bandit-based admission with value-driven, multi-factor eviction, jointly accounting for request frequency, recency, and caching value. Extensive experiments on synthetic and public tool-calling workloads demonstrate that ToolCaching with VAAC achieves up to 11% higher cache hit ratios and 34% lower latency compared to standard policies, effectively accelerating LLM tool-calling in practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "ToolCaching\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VAAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u8bf7\u6c42\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u6784\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u591a\u6837\u800c\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ToolCaching\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86VAAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cToolCaching\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u63d0\u9ad811%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e34%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolCaching\u4e0eVAAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728LLM\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Relevant literature was identified through systematic database searches and hand searches. Analysis of 39 studies revealed four overarching categories of behavior change strategies: coaching strategies, counseling strategies, social influence strategies, and persuasion-enhancing strategies. These strategies highlight the unique affordances of social robots as behavior change interventions and offer valuable design heuristics.

However, optimally sharing and allocating spectrum and power resources to maintain MC while ensuring reliable connectivity and optimal performance remains challeng- ing in such networks. Channel variations induced by mobility in UAV networks, coupled with the varying quality of service (QoS) demands of heterogeneous devices, resource sharing, and fairness requirements in capacity distribution pose challenges to optimal resource allocation. Thus, this paper investigates resource allocation for QoS-constrained, MC-enabled, dynamic UAVs in an integrated TN-NTN environment with spectrum sharing and fairness considerations. To this end, we consider three types of links: UAV-to-radio base station (RBS), UAV-to-UAV, and UAV-to-HAP. We also assume two types of UAVs with diverse QoS requirements to reflect a practical scenario. Consequently, we propose two algorithms. The first algorithm maximizes the capacity of UAVs-RBS and UAVs-HAP links while ensuring the reliability of the UAV-UAV link. To achieve this, the algorithm maximizes the collective throughput of the UAVs by optimizing the sum capacity of all the UAV-RBS and UAV-HAP links. Next, to provide constant capacity to all links and ensure fairness, we propose another algorithm that maximizes the minimum capacity across all links.

In particular, for $(X,d)$, let $k$ be the size of the smallest subset of $X$ such that all but that subset (i.e. the ``outlier set'') can be probabilistically embedded into the space of HSTs with expected distortion at most $c$. Our primary result is showing that there exists an efficient algorithm that takes in $(X,d)$ and a target distortion $c$ and samples from a probabilistic embedding with at most $O(\\frac k \u03b5\\log^2k)$ outliers and distortion at most $(32+\u03b5)c$, for any $\u03b5>0$. This leads to better instance-specific approximations for certain instances of the buy-at-bulk and dial-a-ride problems, whose current best approximation algorithms go through HST embeddings.\n  In order to facilitate our results, we largely focus on the concept of compositions of nested embeddings introduced by [Chawla and Sheridan 2024]. A nested embedding is a composition of two embeddings of a metric space $(X,d)$ -- a low distortion embedding of a subset $S$ of nodes, and a higher distortion embedding of the entire metric. The composition is a single embedding that preserves the low distortion over $S$ and does not increase distortion over the remaining points by much.

The platform is built on distributed, lightweight k3s clusters spanning heterogeneous, low-cost machines and interconnected through an encrypted overlay network, enabling cost-efficient resource pooling while enforcing container-based isolation and per-tenant data access controls. In addition, the platform integrates practical, platform-level defences against prompt injection attacks in RAG-based chatbots, translating insights from recent prompt injection research into deployable security mechanisms without requiring model retraining or enterprise-scale infrastructure.

In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\n  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6db5\u6d1e\u548c\u6c61\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u65b0\u578bFORTRESS\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6392\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u6db5\u6d1e\u548c\u6c61\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\uff09\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u4e86FORTRESS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff08IoU\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff1bFORTRESS\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

However, most existing systems are designed for English-speaking users interacting via keyboards, which limits accessibility in multilingual and voice-first settings, particularly in regions like India. Voice-based interfaces offer a more inclusive modality, but spoken queries involving code present unique challenges due to the presence of non-standard English usage, domain-specific vocabulary, and custom identifiers such as variable and function names, often combined with code-mixed expressions. In this work, we develop a multilingual speech-driven framework for code understanding that accepts spoken queries in a user native language, transcribes them using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applies code-aware ASR output refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs), and interfaces with code models to perform tasks such as code question answering and code retrieval through benchmarks such as CodeSearchNet, CoRNStack, and CodeQA. Focusing on four widely spoken Indic languages and English, we systematically characterize how transcription errors impact downstream task performance. We also identified key failure modes in ASR for code and demonstrated that LLM-guided refinement significantly improves performance across both transcription and code understanding stages. Our findings underscore the need for code-sensitive adaptations in speech interfaces and offer a practical solution for building robust, multilingual voice-driven programming tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6c\u5f55\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\u7528\u6237\u548c\u952e\u76d8\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u4f18\u5148\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u3002\u8bed\u97f3\u754c\u9762\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u67e5\u8be2\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u82f1\u8bed\u7528\u6cd5\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u8f6c\u5f55\u7528\u6237\u6bcd\u8bed\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u611f\u77e5ASR\u8f93\u51fa\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CodeSearchNet\u3001CoRNStack\u548cCodeQA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u53e3\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f6c\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86ASR\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f6c\u5f55\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7801\u654f\u611f\u9002\u914d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

At the same time, applying bionic technology to the structural design of micro soft robots can significantly improve their swimming performance. However, limited by their miniaturization, these robots are difficult to power internally and usually adopt a wireless power supply method. This study designs and fabricates a magnetically responsive, cownose ray-inspired micro soft robot based on the swimming principle of the cownose ray. The robot is made of a certain proportion of NdFeB and PDMS. Then, a three-dimensional Helmholtz coil is used to generate an oscillating harmonic magnetic field to conduct swimming experiments on the robot, exploring the influence of magnetic field parameters on the robot's swimming performance. The experimental results show that the swimming speed is the fastest at B = 5 mT and f = 11 Hz, reaching 5.25 mm/s, which is about 0.5 body lengths per second. In addition, by adjusting the current direction and frequency of the coil, the robot can perform different swimming modes such as straight swimming, turning swimming, and directional swimming. By employing a stepwise adjustment method, the impact of response errors on the robot's trajectory can be effectively reduced.

However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data.

PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \\textit{bounded} and \\textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5185\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728PDP\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u503c\u65e0\u754c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5143\u7d20\u8d21\u732e\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u503c\uff1b\u65e0\u754cPDP\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u6709\u754c\u548c\u65e0\u754cPDP\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5339\u914d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u754c\uff08\u81f3\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5dee\u8ddd\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6709\u754c\u548c\u65e0\u754cPDP\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u754c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08PDP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u6709\u754c\u548c\u65e0\u754cPDP\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u5185\uff09\u3002"}}

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations. Throughout the experimental evaluation, we also identify the simulation cases were regular GPU computation should still be preferred, contributing to the understanding of the strengths and limitations of RT cores.", "AI": {"conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RT Cores\u5728\u7c92\u5b50FRNN\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBVH\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0/\u91cd\u5efa\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u90bb\u5c45\u5217\u8868\u7684\u4e24\u79cdRT Core\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684RT Core\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540cGPU\u4e16\u4ee3\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ecd\u5360\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "i) BVH\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0/\u91cd\u5efa\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff1bii) \u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u90bb\u5c45\u5217\u8868\u7684RT Core\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\uff1biii) \u652f\u6301\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684RT Core\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528Lennard-Jones FRNN\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8eRT Cores\u7684\u7c92\u5b50FRNN\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "BVH\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4f7fRT Core\u7ba1\u9053\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3$\\sim 3.4\\times$\uff1b\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5c0f\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u6b63\u6001\u534a\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0$\\sim1.3\\times$\u548c$\\sim2.0\\times$\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u4e16\u4ee3\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316RT Cores\u5728\u7c92\u5b50FRNN\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecBVH\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u90bb\u5c45\u5217\u8868\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfGPU\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MLLMs\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HFR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982VIS\u3001NIR\u3001SWIR\u3001\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u83b7\u53d6\u7387\u3001\u7b49\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90MLLMs\u5728VIS-NIR\u3001VIS-SWIR\u548cVIS-THERMAL\u7b49\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "MLLMs\u5728\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728HFR\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HFR\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u90e8\u7f72MLLMs\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e25\u683c\u751f\u7269\u7279\u5f81\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}.

They can easily lead to infinite loops or executions, exhaust resources, or introduce logical errors that degrade performance and compromise security. The problem are often undetected by traditional static analyzers because such tools rely on syntactic patterns, which makes them struggle to detect semantic flaws. Consequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for vulnerability detection because of their ability to understand code contextually. Moreover, local LLMs unlike commercial ones like ChatGPT or Gemini addresses issues such as privacy, latency, and dependency concerns by facilitating efficient offline analysis. Consequently, this study proposes a prompt-based framework that utilize local LLMs for the detection of loop vulnerabilities within Python 3.7+ code. The framework targets three categories of loop-related issues, such as control and logic errors, security risks inside loops, and resource management inefficiencies. A generalized and structured prompt-based framework was designed and tested with two locally deployed LLMs (LLaMA 3.2; 3B and Phi 3.5; 4B) by guiding their behavior via iterative prompting. The designed prompt-based framework included key safeguarding features such as language-specific awareness, code-aware grounding, version sensitivity, and hallucination prevention. The LLM results were validated against a manually established baseline truth, and the results indicate that Phi outperforms LLaMA in precision, recall, and F1-score. The findings emphasize the importance of designing effective prompts for local LLMs to perform secure and accurate code vulnerability analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730LLMs\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4bPython\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0cPhi\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5faa\u73af\u6f0f\u6d1e\u662f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u6cd5\u6a21\u5f0f\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u56e0\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u5730LLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLMs\uff08LLaMA 3.2; 3B\u548cPhi 3.5; 4B\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bPython 3.7+\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u7248\u672c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u9884\u9632\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4fdd\u62a4\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Phi\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672c\u5730LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cPhi\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eLLaMA\u3002"}}

Our method proceeds in two stages: first, we construct a decoupled latent space that captures localized motion patterns across different body parts using contrastive learning, enabling accurate and flexible motion retargeting even across robots with diverse morphologies. To enhance alignment between embodiments, we introduce tailored similarity metrics that combine joint rotation and end-effector positioning for critical segments, such as arms. Then, we train a goal-conditioned control policy directly within this latent space using only human data. Leveraging a conditional variational autoencoder, our policy learns to predict latent space displacements guided by intended goal directions. We show that the trained policy can be directly deployed on multiple robots without any adaptation. Furthermore, our method supports the efficient addition of new robots to the latent space by learning only a lightweight, robot-specific embedding layer.

In the overcrowded 2.4 GHz ISM band, however, identifying low-power transmissions from medical sensors is challenging due to strong co-channel interference and substantial power asymmetry with coexisting technologies. This work introduces the first open source framework for automatic recognition of SmartBAN signals in Body Area Networks (BANs). The framework combines a synthetic dataset of simulated signals with real RF acquisitions obtained through Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), enabling both controlled and realistic evaluation.

Its reverse-complement variant, the Shortest Common Superstring problem with Reverse Complements (SCS-RC), naturally arises in bioinformatics applications, where for each input string, either the string itself or its reverse complement must appear as a substring of the superstring. The well-known MGREEDY algorithm for the standard SCS constructs a superstring by first computing an optimal cycle cover on the overlap graph and then concatenating the strings corresponding to the cycles, while its refined variant, TGREEDY, further improves the approximation ratio. Although the original 4- and 3-approximation bounds of these algorithms have been successively improved for the standard SCS, no such progress has been made for the reverse-complement setting. A previous study extended MGREEDY to SCS-RC with a 4-approximation guarantee and briefly suggested that extending TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting could achieve a 3-approximation. In this work, we strengthen these results by proving that the extensions of MGREEDY and TGREEDY to the reverse-complement setting achieve 3.75- and 2.875-approximation ratios, respectively. Our analysis extends the classical proofs for the standard SCS to handle the bidirectional overlaps introduced by reverse complements. These results provide the first formal improvement of approximation guarantees for SCS-RC, with the 2.875-approximate algorithm currently representing the best known bound for this problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55MGREEDY\u548cTGREEDY\u7b97\u6cd5\u81f3SCS-RC\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f973.75\u548c2.875\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6539\u8fdb\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "SCS-RC\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u4e92\u8865\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u6539\u8fdb\u672a\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7684MGREEDY\u548cTGREEDY\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u53cd\u5411\u4e92\u8865\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "MGREEDY\u548cTGREEDY\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672c\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e863.75\u548c2.875\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d2.875\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55MGREEDY\u548cTGREEDY\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u53cd\u5411\u4e92\u8865\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.75\u548c2.875\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e3aSCS-RC\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines.

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys.

These libraries are complex and contain bugs. Researchers have proposed various bug-finding techniques for such libraries. Yet, there is much room for improvement. A key challenge in testing DL libraries is the lack of API specifications. Prior testing approaches often inaccurately model the input specifications of DL APIs, resulting in missed valid inputs that could reveal bugs or false alarms due to invalid inputs.\n  To address this challenge, we develop Centaur -- the first neurosymbolic technique to test DL library APIs using dynamically learned input constraints. Centaur leverages the key idea that formal API constraints can be learned from a small number of automatically generated seed inputs, and that the learned constraints can be solved using SMT solvers to generate valid and diverse test inputs.\n  We develop a novel grammar that represents first-order logic formulae over API parameters and expresses tensor-related properties (e.g., shape, data types) as well as relational properties between parameters. We use the grammar to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) to enumerate syntactically correct candidate rules, validated using seed inputs. Further, we develop a custom refinement strategy to prune the set of learned rules to eliminate spurious or redundant rules. We use the learned constraints to systematically generate valid and diverse inputs by integrating SMT-based solving with randomized sampling.\n  We evaluate Centaur for testing PyTorch and TensorFlow. Our results show that Centaur's constraints have a recall of 94.0% and a precision of 94.0% on average. In terms of coverage, Centaur covers 203, 150, and 9,608 more branches than TitanFuzz, ACETest and Pathfinder, respectively.

By combining analytical modeling, real-time simulation, and machine learning, the framework offers a robust solution for ensuring safe robotic operations. An analytical model was developed to estimate the minimum distances between robotic arms based on their joint configurations, offering precise theoretical calculations that serve as both a validation tool and a benchmark. To complement this, a 3D simulation environment was created to model two 7-DOF Kinova robotic arms, generating a diverse dataset of configurations for collision detection and distance estimation. Using these insights, a deep neural network model was trained with joint actuators of robot arms and relative positions as inputs, achieving a mean absolute error of 282.2 mm and an R-squared value of 0.85. The close alignment between predicted and actual distances highlights the network's accuracy and its ability to generalize spatial relationships.

The tree-independence number of a graph $G$ is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of $G$. As shown recently by Lima et al. [ESA~2024], a large family of optimization problems asking for a maximum-weight induced subgraph of bounded treewidth, satisfying a given \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property, can be solved in polynomial time in graphs whose tree-independence number is bounded by some constant~$k$.\n  However, the complexity of the algorithm of Lima et al. grows rapidly with $k$, making it useless if the tree-independence number is superconstant. In this paper we present a refined version of the algorithm. We show that the same family of problems can be solved in time~$n^{\\mathcal{O}(k)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the instance, $k$ is the tree-independence number, and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot)$-notation hides factors depending on the treewidth bound of the solution and the considered \\textsf{CMSO}$_2$ property.\n  This running time is quasipolynomial for classes of graphs with polylogarithmic tree-independence number; several such classes were recently discovered.

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "DuFal\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u504f\u5411\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDuFal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c40\u90e8\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728LUNA16\u548cToothFairy\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDuFal\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "DuFal\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9891\u57df-\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u89e3\u5256\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth.

Large language models (LLMs) can be advantageous if trained at scale on general knowledge, but especially and in particular when the training data includes information such as detailed map geography topology of the entire planet, as well as the ability to access real time situational data such as weather. However, challenges remain in the interface between drones and LLMs in general, with each application requiring a tedious, labor intensive effort to connect the LLM trained knowledge to drone command and control. Here, we solve that problem, using an interface strategy that is LLM agnostic and drone agnostic, providing the first universal, versatile, comprehensive and easy to use drone control interface. We do this using the new model context protocol (MCP) standard, an open standard that provides a universal way for AI systems to access external data, tools, and services. We develop and deploy a cloud based Linux machine hosting an MCP server that supports the Mavlink protocol, an ubiquitous drone control language used almost universally by millions of drones including Ardupilot and PX4 framework.We demonstrate flight control of a real unmanned aerial vehicle. In further testing, we demonstrate extensive flight planning and control capability in a simulated drone, integrated with a Google Maps MCP server for up to date, real time navigation information.

As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\\% and 22.9\\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-AOA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u7a7a\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u8fdc\u7a0b\u57fa\u7ad9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u94fe\u8def\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ca\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u673a\u8f7d\u8d44\u6e90\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-AOA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM-AOA\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u901f\u7387\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4AOA\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea626.8%\u548c22.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM-AOA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7a\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u53d1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u80fd\u8017\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution.

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Although recent advances have greatly improved LLMs' code completion abilities, evaluation methods have not advanced equally. Most current benchmarks focus solely on functional correctness of code completions based on given context, overlooking models' ability to follow user instructions during completion-a common scenario in LLM-assisted programming. To address this limitation, we present the first instruction-guided code completion benchmark, Controllable Code Completion Benchmark (C3-Bench), comprising 2,195 carefully designed completion tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation of over 40 mainstream LLMs across C3-Bench and conventional benchmarks, we reveal substantial gaps in instruction-following capabilities between open-source and advanced proprietary models during code completion tasks. Moreover, we develop a straightforward data synthesis pipeline that leverages Qwen2.5-Coder to generate high-quality instruction-completion pairs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The resulting model, Qwen2.5-Coder-C3, achieves state-of-the-art performance on C3-Bench.

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images.

Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.\n  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness.

While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection.

This paper presents a compact, low-cost mobile magnetic manipulation platform that overcomes this limitation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our system features a compact four-electromagnet array mounted on a UR5 collaborative robot. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based control strategy is trained through a sim-to-real pipeline, enabling effective policy deployment within 15 minutes and significantly reducing setup time. We validated the platform by controlling a 7-mm magnetic capsule along 2D trajectories. Our DRL-based controller achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.18~mm for a square path and 1.50~mm for a circular path.

Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViT\u66ff\u4ee3U-Net\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u8bca\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Image Transformer Small\uff08DeiT-S\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728ChestX-ray14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acbAI\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ConvNet\uff09\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08alpha=0.5\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cViT\u4e2d\u6027\u5316\u5668\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u8bc6\u522bAUC\u964d\u81f3\u7ea60.80\uff0c\u6bd4\u539f\u6846\u67b6\u4f4e10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f615\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2ROC AUC\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u7ebf\u76845\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u5185\uff0c\u6700\u5dee\u5b50\u7ec4AUC\u63a5\u8fd10.70\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528Vision Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79efU-Net\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728Attribute-Neutral Framework\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

(2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\\rightarrow$ 0.09).

Plume tracking on small quadrotors would allow these systems to operate around humans and fly in more confined spaces, but can be challenging due to poor sensitivity and long response times from gas sensors that fit on small quadrotors. In this work, we present an approach to complement chemical plume tracking with airflow source-seeking behavior using a custom flow sensor that can sense both airflow magnitude and direction on small quadrotors < 100 g. We use this sensor to implement a modified version of the `Cast and Surge' algorithm that takes advantage of flow direction sensing to find and navigate towards flow sources. A series of characterization experiments verified that the system can detect airflow while in flight and reorient the quadrotor toward the airflow. Several trials with random starting locations and orientations were used to show that our source-seeking algorithm can reliably find a flow source. This work aims to provide a foundation for future platforms that can use flow sensors in concert with other sensors to enable richer plume tracking data collection and source-seeking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5bfb\u627e\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u5934\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5e73\u53f0\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73af\u5883\u707e\u5bb3\u9891\u7387\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5bfb\u627e\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u9897\u7c92\u6e90\u5934\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5468\u56f4\u548c\u66f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6765\u8865\u5145\u5316\u5b66\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u8be5\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c0f\u4e8e100\u514b\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u4e0a\u611f\u77e5\u6c14\u6d41\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u7684'Cast and Surge'\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6c14\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u5e76\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c14\u6d41\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u591a\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6e90\u5934\u5bfb\u627e\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u627e\u5230\u6c14\u6d41\u6e90\u5934\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5e73\u53f0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u6c14\u6d41\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7fbd\u6d41\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6e90\u5934\u5bfb\u627e\u3002"}}

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing.

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Aerial robots offer superior maneuverability and search efficiency, but they also introduce new challenges in spatial perception, dynamic control, and safety assurance. In this paper, we propose AION for vision-based aerial ObjectNav without relying on external localization or global maps. AION is an end-to-end dual-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework that decouples exploration and goal-reaching behaviors into two specialized policies. We evaluate AION on the AI2-THOR benchmark and further assess its real-time performance in IsaacSim using high-fidelity drone models.

For associated codebase, see https://github.com/hilab-open-source/deltadorsal", "summary": "The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface \"click\" without visible movement while minimizing model size.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u624b\u80cc\u76ae\u80a4\u5f62\u53d8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "XR\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u56fa\u6709\u5730\u53d7\u5230\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u624b\u6307\u906e\u6321\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6d41delta\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u624b\u90e8\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u653e\u677e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u59ff\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u7684\u624b\u80cc\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\uff08\u624b\u6307\u906e\u6321>=50%\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MPJAE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8618%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6574\u4e2a\u624b\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5982\u98df\u6307\u634f\u5408\u548c\u8f7b\u51fb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u65e0\u53ef\u89c1\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u957f\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u201c\u70b9\u51fb\u201d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePPO\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863-DOF\u8e1d\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKronecker\u79ef\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7PPO\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cPPO\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u7ec4\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5eb7\u590d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels.

While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from \"over-correction\", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.\n  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length.

First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety.

A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5949\u627f\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6709\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u635f\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u65f6\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u6094\u6068\u2019\uff0c\u4e14\u5949\u627f\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u89c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u672a\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3001\u566a\u97f3\u6216\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5949\u627f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u8d4c\u5c40\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM-as-a-judge\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u4e2d\u7acb\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u5949\u627f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46Claude\u548cMistral\u5728\u635f\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u65f6\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u6094\u6068\u2019\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u5949\u627f\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u89c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f46Claude\u548cMistral\u5728\u660e\u786e\u635f\u5bb3\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u65f6\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u2018\u9053\u5fb7\u6094\u6068\u2019\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u5949\u627f\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u504f\u89c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u89c1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u503e\u5411\u3002"}}

To promote safer and more predictable interaction in dynamic flight, Glove2UAV is designed as a lightweight and easily deployable wearable interface intended for real-time operation. Glove2UAV streams inertial measurements in real time and estimates palm and finger orientations using a compact processing pipeline that combines median-based outlier suppression with Madgwick-based orientation estimation. The resulting motion estimations are mapped to a small set of control primitives for directional flight (forward/backward and lateral motion) and, when supported by the platform, to object-interaction commands. Vibrotactile feedback is triggered when flight speed exceeds predefined threshold values, providing an additional alert channel during operation. We validate real-time feasibility by synchronizing glove signals with UAV telemetry in both simulation and real-world flights. The results show fast gesture-based command execution, stable coupling between gesture dynamics and platform motion, correct operation of the core command set in our trials, and timely delivery of vibratile warning cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "Glove2UAV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u503c\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u548cMadgwick\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u539f\u8bed\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u547d\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8026\u5408\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u547d\u4ee4\u96c6\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e6\u89c9\u8b66\u544a\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "conclusion": "Glove2UAV\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52bf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u8b66\u544a\u63d0\u793a\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

IEEE TechDefense 2025", "summary": "Autonomous Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) enable military and civilian covert operations in coastal areas without relying on support vessels or Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore.

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner.

Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier.

Existing methods, however, require parameterizing extrinsic parameters based on different mounting configurations, limiting their generalizability. Additionally, spinning actuated LiDAR inevitably scans featureless regions, which complicates the balance between scanning coverage and localization robustness. To address these challenges, this letter presents a targetless LiDAR-motor calibration (LM-Calibr) on the basis of the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and an environmental adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry (EVA-LIO). LM-Calibr supports calibration of LiDAR-motor systems with various mounting configurations. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy and convergence across different scenarios, mounting angles, and initial values. Additionally, EVA-LIO adaptively selects downsample rates and map resolutions according to spatial scale. This adaptivity enables the actuator to operate at maximum speed, thereby enhancing scanning completeness while ensuring robust localization, even when LiDAR briefly scans featureless areas.

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRACK \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 LLMs \u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u51b2\u7a81\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\uff0c\u672a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 TRACK \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\uff08WIKI\u3001CODE \u548c MATH\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u66f4\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u3002", "conclusion": "TRACK \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u51b2\u7a81\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While human athletes can effectively perceive environmental characteristics to select appropriate footholds for obstacle traversal, endowing legged robots with similar perceptual reasoning remains a significant challenge.

To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks.

To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u800c\u9700\u7f16\u7801\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5373\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7f16\u7801\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9075\u5faa\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u8ffd\u6c42\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

Current research on Lie group based extended Kalman filters has demonstrated that error propagation autonomy holds in low-precision applications, such as in micro electromechanical system (MEMS) based integrated navigation without considering earth rotation and inertial device biases. However, in high-precision navigation state estimation, maintaining autonomy is extremely difficult when considering with earth rotation and inertial device biases. This paper presents the theoretical analysis on the autonomy of SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models under inertial, earth and world frame respectively. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the limitation of the traditional, trivial SE2(3) group navigation modeling method is that the presence of Coriolis force terms introduced by velocity in non-inertial frame.

Camera-ready Version", "summary": "Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward.

After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIGNAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6559\u80b2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u529f\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u5408\uff0cALIGNAgent\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "method": "ALIGNAgent\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u6210\u7ee9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u4ee3\u7406\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u504f\u597d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u672c\u79d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cALIGNAgent\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe0.87-0.90\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.84-0.87\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIGNAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\u3002"}}

Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.", "AI": {"tldr": "AUTOBUS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u4e1a\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f01\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u90e8\u95e8\u9694\u79bb\u3001\u6d41\u7a0b\u50f5\u5316\u548c\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4e1a\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800cLLMs\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "AUTOBUS\u5c06\u4e1a\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u524d\u540e\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c4\u5219\u548cAPI\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u5f15\u64ce\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "AUTOBUS\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u5f15\u64ce\u534f\u8c03\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e1a\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "conclusion": "AUTOBUS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u534f\u8c03\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e1a\u52a1\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e1a\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss.

We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u5c1a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u4f46\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u96f6\u552e\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u5c1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5c5e\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728DeepFashion-MultiModal\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e5d\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0870.8% F1\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0834.1% NA-F1\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee590%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u65d7\u8230\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5c1a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use.

Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).\n  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO.

To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region.

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation.

Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration.

To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics.

To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.\n  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages.

Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining.

Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark.

However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement.

Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86GP\u6f14\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316DFJSS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684DFJSS\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5GP\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u8de8\u7c7b\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5173\u952e\u8f66\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9GP\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5305\u542b\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e14\u673a\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u8f66\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aDFJSS\u4e2dGP\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684GP\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784DFJSS\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.", "AI": {"tldr": "LL-GaussianImage\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57282DGS\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u57df\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5904\u74062DGS\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u89e3\u538b-\u589e\u5f3a-\u518d\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u6b21\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684Mixture-of-Experts\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bf92DGS\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5c5e\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u538b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u57df\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "LL-GaussianImage \u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u57df\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well.

The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes.

The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms.

Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "SigEnt-SAC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "SigEnt-SAC \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u5458-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165sigmoid\u9650\u5236\u7684\u71b5\u9879\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8d1f\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u51cf\u5c11Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cSigEnt-SAC\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u5feb\u8fbe\u5230100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "SigEnt-SAC \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86Q\u51fd\u6570\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification.

To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark.

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u653e\u5f03\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5411\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\uff08IAC\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u5982\u4f55\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5411\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\uff08IAC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bba\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0d\u518d\u6ee1\u8db3\u6838\u5fc3\u793e\u4f1a\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8bc1\u636e\u663e\u793a\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u8bb0\u8005\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u610f\u5411\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\uff1b\u6982\u5ff5\u5de5\u7a0b\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eIAC\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9f13\u52b1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u4ea7\u54c1\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u610f\u5411\u6027\u4ee3\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\uff08IAC\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u5e94\u653e\u5f03\u8fd9\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5373\u521b\u9020\u529b\u5e94\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002"}}

The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\\% compared to conventional irrigation methods.

This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE PerCom 2026", "summary": "With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x.

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.", "AI": {"tldr": "ErrorMap\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522bLLM\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210ErrorAtlas\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ErrorMap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u5931\u8d25\u7b7e\u540d\u201d\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210ErrorAtlas\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528ErrorMap\u523035\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c83\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210ErrorAtlas\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ErrorMap\u548cErrorAtlas\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8c03\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u660e\u667a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art.

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation.

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise.

Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis.

MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978.

However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation.

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model.

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.", "AI": {"conclusion": "\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e14\\texttt{gate\\_proj}\u88ab\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u67b6\u6784\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u8f6c\u79fb\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5355\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5bfc\u5411\u76d1\u7763\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u67b6\u6784\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "result": "\u60c5\u611f\u9002\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u6295\u5f71(\\texttt{gate\\_proj})\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574\u7ea624.5\\%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230AffectGPT\u5728\u516b\u9879\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d96.6\\%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236(\\texttt{gate\\_proj})\u4e2d\u4ecb\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8c03\u6574\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present.

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency.

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepBound\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u63d0\u5347MILP\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMILP\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "DeepBound\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u754c\u6811\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aNP\u96beMILP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDeepBound\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepBound\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MILP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u3002"}}

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6539\u5584LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u663e\u5f0f\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5851\u9020\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u8bed\u6c14\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u60c5\u611f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684VAD\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u77ac\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6216\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u800c\u72b6\u6001\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u65bd\u52a0\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6062\u590d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvolSplat4D\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f3D\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "EvolSplat4D\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8fd1\u8ddd\u9759\u6001\u533a\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI-360\u3001KITTI\u3001Waymo\u548cPandaSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvolSplat4D\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EvolSplat4D\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u524d\u9988\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons.

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX.

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics.

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis.

Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios.

First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "ActionMesh\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f43D\u6269\u6563\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f3D\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u753b3D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8c03\u65743D\u6269\u6563\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u72ec\u7acb3D\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6f5c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u5e8f3D\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u72ec\u7acb\u5f62\u72b6\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u53c2\u8003\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u52304D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Consistent4D\u3001Objaverse\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cActionMesh\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ActionMesh\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f43D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f3D\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u753b3D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation.

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps.

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
