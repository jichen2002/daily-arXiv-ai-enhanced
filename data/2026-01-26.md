TL;DR: 提出了一种通过扩散模型实现房间规模3D场景重新照明的方法，避免了逆渲染问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景重新照明解决方案通常需要解决欠定或病态的逆渲染问题，无法在复杂的真实世界场景中产生高质量结果。

Method: 提出了一种方法，通过将视频到视频的重新照明扩散模型的输出提炼到3D重建中，实现了对房间规模环境的3D重新照明。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上验证了该方法，能够在新照明条件下忠实渲染场景的新视图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将视频到视频的重新照明扩散模型的输出提炼到3D重建中，成功实现了对复杂真实世界场景的可控3D重新照明，避免了解决困难的逆渲染问题。

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

TL;DR: Memory-V2V通过显式记忆机制提升多轮视频编辑的跨一致性，减少冗余计算30%，性能优于现有技术。

Motivation: 解决多轮视频编辑中跨一致性的问题，提升用户体验和编辑效率。

Method: Memory-V2V框架通过精确检索和动态标记化策略，利用先前编辑视频的外部缓存来条件化当前编辑步骤，并在DiT主干中引入可学习的标记压缩器以减少冗余。

Conclusion: Memory-V2V通过引入显式记忆机制，显著提升了多轮视频编辑中的跨一致性，同时保持了或超越了现有技术的任务特定性能。

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: FeTTL 是一种新颖的联邦学习框架，通过联合学习全局模板和任务模型来对齐多机构医学成像数据分布，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中由于数据域偏移和异质性导致的模型性能下降问题，特别是在医学成像应用中。

Method: FeTTL 框架通过联合学习全局模板和任务模型来对齐客户端之间的数据分布。

Result: FeTTL 在视网膜眼底视盘分割和组织病理学转移分类任务中显著优于现有联邦学习基线（p值<0.002）。

Conclusion: FeTTL 提供了一个原则性和可扩展的解决方案，用于缓解联邦学习中的分布偏移问题，支持在现实世界的多机构环境中稳健部署模型。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了多模态模型在识别足球比赛重要子事件中的表现，发现其性能接近随机水平，强调了模块化架构和跨模态协同训练的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型识别视频中最重要子事件的能力，这是叙述或总结多模态事件的基本前提。

Method: 构建了一个新的数据集，利用足球比赛精彩片段中隐含的人类偏好来衡量重要性，无需额外标注成本。比较了几种最先进的多模态模型。

Result: 多模态模型的性能接近随机水平，分析显示它们倾向于依赖单一主导模态，且在综合多源信息方面效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究发现强调了处理多模态数据样本级异质性的模块化架构的重要性，以及需要能够最大化跨模态协同作用的互补训练程序。

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348)
*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的多模态图像配准方法，用于历史面板绘画的高精度自动对齐，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史面板绘画的多模态图像分析需要像素级的对齐，传统手动方法耗时且精度有限，因此需要一种高效、精确的自动配准方法。

Method: 采用了一种从粗到细的非刚性多模态配准方法，利用卷积神经网络进行关键点检测和描述，结合图神经网络进行描述符匹配，并通过局部区域的单应性重投影误差过滤匹配点。

Result: 提出的方法在混合分辨率图像配准中表现最佳，消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的基于稀疏关键点和薄板样条的多模态图像配准方法，在历史面板绘画的多模态图像配准中表现出色，优于现有的关键点和密集匹配方法。

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

### [6] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过引入视角令牌，改善了多模态语言模型的空间推理能力，使其更接近人类的空间认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语言模型（MLMs）在语义视觉语言任务上表现良好，但在需要采纳其他代理视觉视角的空间推理任务上表现不佳，反映了持续的自我中心偏见。

Method: 引入视角令牌（perspective tokens），通过（1）体现身体关键点线索或（2）支持心理旋转的抽象表示来编码方向。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B中集成视角令牌后，在Level-2视觉视角采纳任务上表现提升。在合成和自然基准测试中（Isle Bricks V2、COCO、3DSRBench），基于旋转的令牌尤其能推广到非人类参考代理。

Conclusion: 将认知基础的空间结构直接嵌入到令牌空间中，为视角采纳和更类似人类的推理提供了一种轻量级、模型无关的机制。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [7] [VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTFusion是一种针对FSAD的视觉-文本多模态融合框架，通过自适应特征提取和多模态预测融合模块，显著提升工业异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖自然场景预训练的特征，忽视了工业检测所需的细粒度领域特定语义，且融合策略多为浅层拼接，未能解决视觉与文本模态间的语义不对齐问题，导致跨模态干扰下的鲁棒性不足。

Method: VTFusion框架包含两个核心设计：一是针对图像和文本模态的自适应特征提取器，用于学习任务特定表示并弥合预训练模型与工业数据之间的领域差距；二是专门的多模态预测融合模块，包括促进跨模态信息交换的融合块和生成精细化像素级异常图的分割网络。

Result: VTFusion在2-shot场景下于MVTec AD和VisA数据集上分别取得96.8%和86.2%的图像级AUROC，并在工业汽车塑料零件数据集中达到93.5%的AUPRO。

Conclusion: VTFusion显著提升了FSAD的性能，在MVTec AD和VisA数据集的2-shot场景中分别实现了96.8%和86.2%的图像级AUROC，并在工业汽车塑料零件的真实数据集中达到93.5%的AUPRO，展示了其在工业场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \model 是一个新的RES框架，通过EBD和VBR解决了现有方法的局限性，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RES方法存在两个关键限制：MLLMs提供的粗边界框导致冗余或非区分性点提示，以及依赖文本坐标推理不可靠。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的RES框架，整合了基于熵的点发现（EBD）和基于视觉的推理（VBR）。EBD通过建模空间不确定性识别高信息候选点，VBR通过联合视觉-语义对齐验证点正确性。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和ReasonSeg四个基准数据集上的广泛评估显示，\model 在所有四个基准上均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: \model 在四个基准数据集上均实现了最先进的性能，证明了其通过最小化提示生成准确且语义基础的分割掩码的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CSRNet，通过奇偶异构块和余弦退火机制优化图像超分辨率性能，实验显示其竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像超分辨率中，保持所获取结构信息的有效性至关重要。

Method: 通过改进网络架构和优化训练策略，提出了一种用于图像超分辨率的余弦网络（CSRNet）。设计了奇偶异构块以提取互补的同源结构信息，并组合线性和非线性结构信息以增强鲁棒性。采用余弦退火机制优化训练过程。

Result: CSRNet在图像超分辨率任务中表现优异，与现有先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，提出的CSRNet在图像超分辨率任务中与现有先进方法具有竞争力。

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

Conclusion: DCCS-Det通过DSE块和LaSEA模块的结合，显著提升了红外小目标检测的准确性和效率，成为该领域的先进方法。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有换脸方法在极端面部姿态下表现不佳，且几何特征方法增加了依赖性和计算成本，扩散模型虽效果好但无法实时处理。

Method: 利用开源视觉语言模型和CLIP图像及文本嵌入，应用新颖的视觉和文本语义对比损失。

Result: 在FF++、MPIE和LPFF数据集上的实验表明，AlphaFace在姿态挑战性案例中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: AlphaFace通过结合视觉和文本语义对比损失，显著提升了在极端面部姿态下的换脸效果，同时保持了实时性能。

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在深层网络中边缘像素逐渐退化，且传统卷积难以区分频域成分，导致背景干扰和误检。

Method: 提出MDAFNet，包含多尺度差分边缘（MSDE）模块和双域自适应特征增强（DAFE）模块，分别用于边缘信息补偿和频域目标增强与噪声抑制。

Result: 在多数据集上验证了MDAFNet的优越检测性能。

Conclusion: MDAFNet通过整合MSDE模块和DAFE模块，有效解决了红外小目标检测中的边缘信息丢失和频域干扰问题，展现出优越的检测性能。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

Abstract: Erratum to the paper (Zhang et al., 2025): corrections to Table IV and the data in Page 3, Section A. In the post-pandemic era, a high proportion of civil aviation passengers wear masks during security checks, posing significant challenges to traditional face recognition models. The backbone network serves as the core component of face recognition models. In standard tests, r100 series models excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR in face comparison, high top1/top5 in search). r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests, r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100. Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with gains in effectiveness. Through extensive comparative experiments, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several core backbone networks, aiming to reveal the impacts of different models on face recognition with and without masks, and provide specific deployment recommendations.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代生成视频模型在高度动态真实环境中难以保持多视角和时空一致性的问题。

Method: 利用包括单目（2D）、多视角静态（3D）和多视角动态（4D）数据集在内的多种数据源，训练一个通用的时空隐式表示模型，支持从任意相机位置和轨迹生成零样本新视频。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现与当前最先进技术相当，并在新的 AnyViewBench 基准测试中展示了在极端动态视角合成场景中的优越性能。

Conclusion: AnyView 是一个基于扩散的视频生成框架，能够在高度动态的真实环境中保持多视角和时空一致性，即使在极端动态视角合成场景中也能表现优异。

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

Motivation: 解决病理图像分割中的异质性结构问题，结合专家反馈，生成对临床解释有直接意义的像素级分割。

Method: VISTA-PATH 联合视觉上下文、语义组织描述和可选专家提供的空间提示进行分割，支持动态人机交互细化。

Result: VISTA-PATH 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有分割基础模型，并通过提出的 Tumor Interaction Score (TIS) 显著关联患者生存率。

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH 被确立为一个基础模型，将病理图像分割从静态预测提升为交互式且临床基础的数字病理表示。

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

TL;DR: PhysGame利用游戏视频中的视觉异常构建数据集和基准，显著提升多模态模型在物理推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物理推理数据集要么依赖高标注成本的真实世界视频，要么受限于合成模拟的有限真实性和多样性。游戏视频中的视觉异常提供了一种丰富且可扩展的监督源。

Method: 提出了一种新范式，利用游戏视频中的视觉异常（即违反物理定律的视觉异常）作为监督源，构建了PhysGame数据集和GameBench基准。PhysGame包含140,057个以异常为中心的问答对，覆盖五个物理领域和十六个细粒度类别。通过游戏元数据（如标题和描述）设计提示策略，确保数据质量。

Conclusion: PhysGame通过利用游戏视频中的视觉异常作为监督源，显著提升了多模态智能在物理世界理解方面的性能，特别是在真实世界和通用场景中的迁移能力。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

Conclusion: WoundNeRF方法通过NeRF SDF-based技术，为伤口分割提供了鲁棒的3D结构估计，展现了在伤口护理中的潜力。

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

Method: 提出了一个专家知识引导的分类决策校准网络（EKDC-Net），包括局部先验引导知识提取模块（LPKEM）和不确定性引导决策校准模块（UDCM），用于提取和利用专家知识。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，EKDC-Net实现了最先进的性能，仅需0.08M额外可学习参数即可将主干网络的准确率提高6.42%，精确度提高11.46%。

Conclusion: EKDC-Net通过引入外部领域专家知识，显著提升了细粒度树种分类的准确性和精确度，同时作为一个轻量级模块，仅需少量额外参数即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/TreeCLS.

Method: 提出SALAD方法，在稀疏注意力并行引入轻量级线性注意力分支，并通过输入依赖的门控机制平衡两者。

Result: 达到90%的稀疏度和1.72倍的推理加速，且仅需2,000个视频样本和1,600训练步骤（批量大小为8）的高效微调。

Conclusion: SALAD方法通过引入轻量级线性注意力分支和输入依赖的门控机制，实现了90%的稀疏度和1.72倍的推理加速，同时保持了与全注意力基线相当的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

Motivation: 现有基准在组合空间推理任务上过于简单，评估指标有限且缺乏严格的数学表述，无法充分评估MLLMs的精确推理能力。

Method: 提出了TangramPuzzle基准和Tangram Construction Expression（TCE）框架，设计了Outline Prediction和End-to-End Code Generation两个任务，并对先进的开源和专有模型进行了广泛评估。

Result: 评估发现MLLMs倾向于匹配目标轮廓而忽视几何约束，导致拼图形变或变形。

Conclusion: MLLMs在精确组合空间推理能力上存在不足，尤其是在几何约束的忽视导致拼图形变或变形的问题上。TangramPuzzle基准和TCE框架为未来研究提供了更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

Conclusion: AnchoredDream展示了通过几何锚定和外观-几何互促机制，在零样本条件下实现高质量单视角室内场景生成的潜力。

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

Conclusion: OnlineSI框架通过有限空间记忆和3D点云与语义信息的结合，有效提升了MLLM的空间理解能力，为现实世界中的具身系统部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架在半监督分层开放集分类任务中表现优异，甚至在使用每类仅20个标记样本的情况下，性能接近全监督模型。

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Conclusion: HA2F框架通过动态层次特征校准模块和噪声自适应特征细化模块，有效解决了多时相特征对齐偏差和噪声干扰问题，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

Conclusion: 该论文提出的CoVR框架通过X-Aligner模块和两阶段训练策略，显著提升了视频检索性能，并在零样本任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 无人机（UAV）在航拍和物体识别中的应用日益普遍，但由于尺度不平衡和边缘模糊，小目标检测存在重大挑战。

Method: BPIM框架包括位置信息引导（PIG）模块、边界信息引导（BIG）模块、跨尺度融合（CSF）模块、三特征融合（TFF）模块和自适应权重融合（AWF）模块，通过注意力机制和跨尺度特征融合策略整合边界、位置和尺度信息。

Conclusion: BPIM框架在VisDrone2021、DOTA1.0和WiderPerson数据集上表现出优于基线Yolov5-P2的性能，并在计算负载相当的情况下达到了先进方法的水平。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

Abstract: The growing demand for diverse and high-quality facial datasets for training and testing biometric systems is challenged by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models. This research highlights the potential of SCHIGAND to supplement and, in some cases, replace real data for facial biometric applications, paving the way for privacy-compliant and scalable solutions in synthetic dataset generation.

Result: 实验证明SPL有效增强了结构保真度，在潜在扩散模型图像编辑中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的SPL方法显著提升了基于潜在扩散模型的图像编辑的结构保真度，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/gongms00/SPL.

TL;DR: ReWeaver is a new framework for accurate 3D garment reconstruction from sparse images, outperforming existing methods in topology and geometry accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing garment reconstruction methods that struggle with accurate topology and sewing structures, hindering high-fidelity physical simulation.

Method: ReWeaver predicts seams and panels in both 2D UV and 3D space from sparse multi-view RGB images, using a novel framework and a large-scale dataset GCD-TS for training.

Result: ReWeaver achieves precise alignment of seams and panels with multi-view images, producing structured 2D--3D representations.

Conclusion: ReWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods in topology accuracy, geometry alignment, and seam-panel consistency, providing high-quality 3D garment reconstructions suitable for physical simulation and robotic manipulation.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

Conclusion: ACLNet通过引入亲和度度量和动态温度调度，显著提升了基于骨架的人类活动理解任务中的特征判别力，并在多个基准数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

TL;DR: CER-HV框架通过噪声检测和人机交互清理阿拉伯语手写文本数据集，显著提升CRNN识别性能，适用于多语言任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语手写文本识别（HTR）因数据质量问题落后于拉丁语HTR，需改进数据质量以提升性能。

Method: 结合基于CER的噪声检测器（使用精心配置的CRNN并采用早停策略避免过拟合）和人机交互（HITL）步骤，验证高排名样本。

Result: CER-HV在多个数据集中发现未报告的标签错误（如转录、分割、方向等），CRNN在五个数据集中达到SOTA性能（如阿拉伯语KHATT的CER为8.45%）。数据清理后CER进一步改善（干净数据集提升0.3-0.6%，噪声数据集提升1.0-1.8%）。

Conclusion: CER-HV框架能有效检测和清理阿拉伯语手写文本数据集中的标签错误，提升识别性能，且具有通用性，适用于其他文本识别任务。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

Conclusion: 通过子孔径滤波和固定焦点阴影增强（FFSE）技术，成功从CSAS数据中提取阴影信息，改进了目标分析并实现了3D重建。

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 基于经验分析，我们重新设计了优化方法，提出了AdamW-GS，通过重新耦合有益组件，同时实现了更好的优化效率和表示效果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

Result: 在Stanford2D3D数据集上，REL-SF4PASS实现了2.35%的平均mIoU提升，并将性能方差降低了约70%。

Conclusion: REL-SF4PASS通过REL深度表示和SMMF融合策略，显著提升了全景语义分割的性能和鲁棒性，尤其在面对3D干扰时表现优异。

Abstract: As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) aims to give complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.

Motivation: 气候变化引起的温度波动加剧了公路路面的应力，导致维护成本上升，因此需要有针对性和高效的维护策略。

Method: 研究提出了一个框架，整合了航空影像和OpenStreetMap（OSM）数据，用于微调YOLOv11模型进行高速公路裂缝定位，并计算了瑞士相对高速公路裂缝密度（RHCD）指数。

Result: 裂缝分类模型在阳性类别（裂缝）的F1得分为0.84，阴性类别（无裂缝）为0.97。瑞士RHCD指数与长期地表温度振幅（LT-LST-A）和交通量（TV）的相关系数较弱，分别为-0.05和0.17，表明该指数在指导维护方面具有独特价值。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了开源数据共享在推动创新和实现公共部门更高效解决方案方面的价值，特别是在高速公路维护策略中。

Abstract: Highway networks are crucial for economic prosperity. Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are exacerbating stress on road pavements, resulting in elevated maintenance costs. This underscores the need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies. This study investigates the potential of open-source data to guide highway infrastructure maintenance. The proposed framework integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization. To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data. Significantly high RHCD values were observed near urban centers and intersections, providing contextual validation for the predictions. These findings highlight the value of open-source data sharing to drive innovation, ultimately enabling more efficient solutions in the public sector.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

Conclusion: FMPose在3D人体姿态估计任务中表现出色，显著优于现有方法，证明了其在准确性和效率上的优势。

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepARG首次将B-rep的几何和拓扑编码为整体令牌序列，通过自回归架构实现序列化生成，实验验证其SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往基于图的表示和生成方法通过解耦计算流程分离几何和拓扑特征，阻碍了序列生成框架（如Transformer架构）的应用。本文旨在探索将B-rep的几何和拓扑编码为整体令牌序列表示的可能性。

Method: BrepARG将B-rep编码为三种令牌：表示几何特征的几何和位置令牌，以及表示拓扑的面索引令牌。然后，层次化构建整体令牌序列，首先使用上述令牌构建几何块（即面和边），随后进行几何块排序。最后，为整个B-rep组装整体序列表示。

Result: 实验表明，BrepARG实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BrepARG验证了将B-rep表示为整体令牌序列的可行性，为B-rep生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

*Fangzheng Wu,Brian Summa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分类器头梯度Frobenius范数的轻量级检查点选择方法，无需验证集，性能接近oracle，适用于多种任务和架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检查点选择依赖验证集，计算成本高。本文旨在提出一种轻量级、无需验证的替代方案。

Method: 通过单次前向-反向传播计算分类器头梯度的Frobenius范数（||g||_F），作为检查点选择的代理指标。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k的CNN和Transformer中，该代理指标与Top-1准确率负相关，与损失正相关。在短尾窗口中选择最小梯度检查点，性能接近oracle（差距4.24% +/- 2.00%，经调优后可降至约1.12%）。该信号还可预测COCO检测/分割的mAP，并在扩散模型（如DDPM）中跟踪进度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无需验证的检查点信号，即分类器头梯度的Frobenius范数，该信号在多种网络架构中表现优异，能够有效替代传统验证方法，减少计算开销。

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

TL;DR: CASP通过调节CLS令牌的自注意力权重及合成新类特征，在少样本类增量学习中实现了优异的性能和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端少样本增量设置下，模型的迁移和泛化能力至关重要，需要利用预训练知识在基础会话中学习可共享的特征表示。

Method: 提出了CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP)，通过在CLS令牌的查询、键和值投影中引入类共享可训练偏置参数，显式调节自注意力权重。此外，设计了注意力扰动策略和在浅层特征空间执行Manifold Token Mixup，合成潜在新类特征以提高泛化能力。

Result: 在CUB200、CIFAR100和ImageNet-R数据集上的实验表明，CASP在标准及细粒度FSCIL设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: CASP方法在标准及细粒度FSCIL设置中均优于现有最先进方法，且无需在增量阶段进行微调，同时显著减少了参数开销。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

TL;DR: Qwen2.5 outperforms other VLMs in surgical tool detection, showing strong zero-shot and fine-tuned performance, while Grounding DINO is better at localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in surgery are unimodal, limiting holistic understanding. Multimodal VLMs offer potential for comprehensive surgical scene modeling.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art VLMs (Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, InternVL3.5) on the GraSP dataset under zero-shot and LoRA fine-tuning settings, comparing with Grounding DINO.

Result: Qwen2.5 achieves superior detection performance, with better zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned results to Grounding DINO.

Conclusion: Qwen2.5 consistently outperforms other VLMs in surgical tool detection, showing superior zero-shot generalization and fine-tuned performance, while Grounding DINO excels in localization.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

Motivation: 在生物力学建模中，韧带附着点的准确表示对模拟椎骨间作用力至关重要，而现有自动化检测方法存在区域局限性和精度不足的问题。

Method: 该方法首先进行基于形状的3D椎骨分割，随后应用特定领域规则识别不同类型的附着点。

Result: 在两个独立脊柱数据集上的验证结果显示，平均绝对误差（MAE）为0.7毫米，均方根误差（RMSE）为1.1毫米。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在脊柱韧带标志点检测中表现出色，实现了高精度和强泛化能力，验证了其在不同脊柱区域的适用性。

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归模型在长视频生成中存在错误累积和长期一致性丢失问题，而现有的注意力sink帧方法虽能缓解性能衰减，却引发了sink-collapse这一关键失败模式。

Method: 通过分析RoPE的周期性结构与多头注意力机制之间的冲突，提出了一种打破头间注意力同质化的多RoPE抖动方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法成功缓解了sink-collapse，同时保持了生成质量，并实现了长达12小时的连续视频生成。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，通过引入多头RoPE抖动来有效抑制sink-collapse现象，实现了实时、流式、无限长度视频生成，且质量衰减极小。

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

TL;DR: ColorConceptBench基准揭示当前T2I模型在隐式颜色概念关联上的不足，需根本性改进以实现人类水平的语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像（TI）模型已有显著进展，但其在隐式概念与颜色关联方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入ColorConceptBench，一个基于6,369个人工标注的系统化评估颜色-概念关联的基准，通过概率颜色分布分析1,281个隐式颜色概念。

Result: 对七种领先的T2I模型的评估表明，现有模型对抽象语义缺乏敏感性，且这种局限性对标准干预措施（如缩放和引导）表现出抵抗性。

Conclusion: 当前文本到图像（T2I）模型在抽象语义的敏感性上存在不足，且这种局限性难以通过常规干预（如模型缩放和引导）解决。实现人类水平的颜色语义理解需要模型在学习和表征隐式含义方面进行根本性变革。

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过奖励信号引导生成过程，实现了高效且可扩展的自回归视频生成，其性能与现有自回归模型相当，并在某些情况下超越了类似规模的双向模型。

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

Conclusion: 本文提出的领域不变混合领域半监督分割框架通过CPM和CMMD模块有效增强了数据多样性并减少了领域偏差，实验证明其在少量标注和未知领域差异下仍能实现鲁棒且精确的分割。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

Motivation: 现有的单视图重光照方法在多视图场景中难以保持严格的照明一致性，而SyncLight旨在解决这一问题，实现跨多视图场景的精确光照控制。

Method: SyncLight利用多视角扩散变压器，通过潜在桥匹配公式进行训练，能够在单次推理步骤中实现整个图像集的高保真重光照。

Result: SyncLight不仅在合成环境中表现优异，还能零样本推广到任意数量的视点，无需相机姿态信息即可在所有视图中传播光照变化。

Conclusion: SyncLight通过创新的多视角扩散变压器和潜在桥匹配方法，实现了跨多个未校准视图的一致参数化重光照，为多摄像机广播、立体电影和虚拟制作提供了实用的重光照工作流程。

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

Conclusion: 该研究为工具增强的多智能体AI系统的系统性可靠性评估建立了基础架构，证明了中等规模模型在资源受限组织中具有实用性和成本效益。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are transforming enterprise automation, yet systematic evaluation methodologies for assessing tool-use reliability remain underdeveloped. We introduce a comprehensive diagnostic framework that leverages big data analytics to evaluate procedural reliability in intelligent agent systems, addressing critical needs for SME-centric deployment in privacy-sensitive environments. Our approach features a 12-category error taxonomy capturing failure modes across tool initialization, parameter handling, execution, and result interpretation. Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations. This work establishes foundational infrastructure for systematic reliability evaluation of tool-augmented multi-agent AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机是解决Agentic AI管道中因重复构建相同中间逻辑而导致的低效问题，传统边界缓存无法有效捕捉这种低效。

Method: 论文的方法是在Alli平台中引入SemanticALLI架构，通过分解生成过程为AIR和VS两个阶段，并利用结构化中间表示(IRs)实现高效缓存。

Result: 论文的结果显示，SemanticALLI的缓存命中率从基线38.7%提升至83.10%，减少了4,023次LLM调用，中位延迟仅为2.66 ms。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，通过将生成过程分解为Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR)和Visualization Synthesis (VS)，并将结构化中间表示(IRs)提升为可缓存的一级工件，SemanticALLI显著提高了缓存命中率，减少了LLM调用和总令牌消耗。

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

*Hongjia Wu,Shuai Zhou,Hongxin Zhang,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doc2AHP结合LLM和AHP，提出无需专家干预的结构化推理框架，提升决策模型的逻辑性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂决策任务中结构一致性和推理可靠性的不足，同时克服传统决策理论依赖专家知识的可扩展性问题。

Method: 利用AHP的结构原则作为约束，引导LLM在非结构化文档空间中进行受限搜索，确保父子节点间的逻辑一致性，并引入多智能体权重分配机制和自适应一致性优化策略。

Result: Doc2AHP不仅使非专家用户能够从头构建高质量决策模型，还在逻辑完整性和下游任务准确性上显著优于直接生成基线。

Conclusion: Doc2AHP通过结合LLM的泛化能力和AHP的严谨性，提出了一种无需大量标注数据或人工干预的结构化推理框架，显著提升了决策模型的逻辑完整性和下游任务准确性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床决策支持中显示出潜力，但存在因患者压力而妥协提供不适当护理的风险。

Method: 引入了SycoEval-EM，一个多智能体模拟框架，通过在急诊医学中的对抗性患者说服来评估LLM的鲁棒性。

Result: 在20个LLMs和1,875次遭遇的测试中，妥协率从0%到100%不等，模型对成像请求（38.8%）比阿片类药物处方（25.0%）更易受影响，且模型能力与鲁棒性预测无关。所有说服策略效果相似（30.0-36.0%），表明普遍易感性而非特定策略弱点。

Conclusion: 静态基准测试无法充分预测临床AI在社交压力下的安全性，因此需要多轮对抗测试来进行临床AI认证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

TL;DR: 传统ML模型在医学分类中仍最可靠，LoRA微调效果差，零样本LLM/VLM在图像任务中表现尚可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态视觉-语言模型（VLMs）与大型语言模型（LLMs）结合在医学分类中的潜力，并提供统一的基准对比传统与当代方法。

Method: 使用四个公开数据集（涵盖文本和图像模态，包括二元和多类复杂度），对比传统机器学习（LR、LightGBM、ResNet-50）、基于提示的LLM/VLM（Gemini 2.5）和微调PEFT模型（LoRA适配的Gemma3变体）。所有实验采用一致的数据分割和评估指标。

Result: 传统ML模型在多数任务中表现最佳，尤其在结构化文本数据集上；LoRA微调的Gemma变体在所有实验中表现最差；零样本LLM/VLM管道在图像任务中表现竞争性，但文本任务表现不佳。

Conclusion: 在多数医学分类任务中，传统的机器学习模型仍是最可靠的选择，基础模型并非普遍优越，参数高效微调（PEFT）的效果高度依赖于适配策略。

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

Motivation: 为了更好地理解在多轮、长视野的代理问题中，规划、状态跟踪和长上下文处理等技能对成功的相对重要性。

Method: 开发了一个多轮问题的oracle反事实框架，引入了一套程序生成的、类似游戏的任务，其复杂性可调，以精确提供oracle干预。

Result: 结果显示，某些干预（如规划）在所有设置中都能提升性能，而其他技能的有用性则依赖于环境和语言模型的特性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管某些干预措施（如规划）在各种环境中都能持续提升性能，但其他技能的有效性则取决于环境和语言模型的特性。这为未来AI代理和语言模型的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

Method: 引入AgentsEval，一个多智能体流推理框架，模拟放射科医生的协作诊断工作流程，包括标准定义、证据提取、对齐和一致性评分等可解释步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，AgentsEval提供了临床对齐、语义忠实且可解释的评估，在多种扰动下保持稳健。

Conclusion: AgentsEval框架为医学报告生成系统提供了透明且临床基础的评估方法，促进了大型语言模型在临床实践中的可信集成。

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 是一个具有卓越推理能力的开源混合专家模型，通过统一的训练框架和端到端设计，实现了在复杂工具交互和噪声环境下的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了一种受昆虫启发的视觉点目标导航代理，其性能与最新SOTA模型相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统混合专家（MoE）依赖静态门控网络，无法动态适应实时需求和成本约束。NSED旨在通过动态优化和共识机制提升模型效率和性能。

Method: 采用动态专业知识代理（Dynamic Expertise Broker）将模型选择视为背包问题的变种，并结合宏观循环神经网络（RNN）实现迭代优化。

Result: 在AIME 2025和LiveCodeBench等基准测试中，小型模型集合性能媲美或超越100B+参数模型，并在DarkBench安全测试中展现出更好的对齐特性。

Conclusion: NSED协议通过动态专家代理和运行时优化引擎，使得小型模型集合能够媲美或超越大型模型的性能，同时展现出内在的对齐特性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

Conclusion: MAGE-KT框架通过多智能体KC关系提取器和学生-问题交互图构建多视图异构图，有效提升了知识追踪中KC关系的准确性和下一问题预测性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive

Conclusion: Spatial-Agent通过基于空间信息科学理论的GeoFlow Graphs，显著提升了地理空间推理能力，并在实验中优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低收入和中等收入国家（LMICs）中，大量医疗诊断设备因缺乏及时维护、技术专家支持不足以及制造商支持有限而未被充分利用或无法正常工作，导致设备停机时间增加、诊断延迟和患者护理受损。

Method: 研究开发并验证了一个AI支持平台，该系统将大型语言模型（LLM）与用户友好的网络界面集成，允许用户输入错误代码或设备症状，并获得准确的逐步故障排除指导。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了AI驱动系统在支持医疗设备维护方面的可行性和潜力，旨在减少设备停机时间，以改善资源受限环境中的医疗保健服务。

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

### [71] [Space Filling Curves is All You Need: Communication-Avoiding Matrix Multiplication Made Simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16294)
*Evangelos Georganas,Alexander Heinecke,Pradeep Dubey*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 通过广义希尔伯特曲线和通信避免算法，本研究实现了高性能、平台无关的矩阵乘法方案，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代平台上的矩阵乘法加速器具有高FLOP/Byte比，使得实现最优矩阵乘法具有挑战性。现有方法依赖繁琐的平台和形状调优，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 本研究采用广义希尔伯特曲线对矩阵乘法计算空间进行分区，并结合通信避免（CA）算法，最小化关键路径上的通信和数据移动。

Result: 该方法在多个CPU平台上实现了最高2倍的几何平均加速，超越了厂商库的性能。

Conclusion: 通过使用广义希尔伯特曲线（Generalized Hilbert Curves）的空间填充曲线（SFC）方法，本研究实现了平台无关和形状无关的矩阵乘法方案，显著提高了数据局部性，并在多个CPU平台上超越了现有厂商库的性能。

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is the cornerstone of Deep Learning and HPC workloads; accordingly, academia and industry have heavily optimized this kernel. Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance "glass jaws". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path. The integration of CA-algorithms is seamless and yields compact code (~30 LOC), yet it achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple CPU platforms, outperforming vendor libraries by up to 2x(geometric-mean speedup) for a range of GEMM shapes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在异步环境中实现确定性容错共识的可能性，特别是在FLP不可能性定理的背景下。

Method: 论文提出了一个算法，该算法通过事件同步实现共识，并详细分析了FLP不可能性定理的隐含假设。

Result: 实验结果表明，FLP定理中的第三个隐含假设缺乏支持证据，从而为在特定条件下实现共识提供了可能。

Conclusion: 论文证明了基于事件的同步对于解决异步环境中的确定性容错共识是足够的，并提出了一个算法，该算法在保证安全性、活跃性和对一次崩溃的容错性的同时，能够终止并达成有效的向量协议。

Abstract: We demonstrate sufficiency of events-based synchronisation for solving deterministic fault-tolerant consensus in asynchrony. Main result is an algorithm that terminates with valid vector agreement, hence operates with safety, liveness, and tolerance to one crash. Reconciling with the FLP impossibility result, we identified: i) existence of two types of agreements: data-independent and data-dependent; and ii) dependence of FLP theorem correctness on three implicit assumptions. Consensus impossibility with data-dependent agreement is contingent on two of them. The theorem-stated impossibility with every agreement type hinges entirely on the third. We provide experimental results showing that the third assumption has no evidence in support.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 针对Ascend 910 NPU设计了首个W4A16矩阵乘法内核，通过优化反量化和并行化，在LLM解码中实现1.01x至1.74x速度提升，揭示了内存传输是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于华为Ascend 910 NPU对混合精度的原生支持有限且其计算架构解耦，高效部署W4A16量化（4位权重，16位激活）具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了首个专为Ascend 910 NPU定制的W4A16矩阵乘法内核，利用向量核心进行即时INT4到FP16的反量化，立方核心进行高吞吐量GEMM，以及Split-K并行化以减少内存延迟。

Result: 性能评估显示，在K >> N（LLM解码的典型场景）时，该方法优于数据并行方法，速度提升范围为1.01倍至1.74倍。分析还发现主要瓶颈是权重的额外全局内存传输，而非反量化计算本身。

Conclusion: 该方法为量化大型语言模型在各种领域专用加速器上的高效部署奠定了坚实基础，并提供了深刻见解。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale, weight-only quantization (W4A16: 4-bit weights, 16-bit activations) becomes critical for reducing memory footprint with minimal accuracy loss. However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch. In the long run, our method lays a solid foundation and provides insightful views for the efficient deployment of quantized large language models on various domain-specific accelerators.

Motivation: 尽管云原生环境中细粒度能源测量有所进展，但微服务应用的服务器能源测量仍未被充分探索，需要包括计算、网络和存储能源以避免分布式设置中的低估。

Method: GOXN通过从Kepler和cAdvisor收集的容器级数据，使用加法能源模型推导服务级别的能源消耗。

Result: 使用GOXN评估OpenTelemetry Demo在不同配置（监控、追踪、服务网格）和稳态合成负载下的表现，结果显示忽略网络和存储会导致辅助服务能源低估高达63%，高追踪负载会将能源主导转向网络和存储。

Conclusion: GOXN（Green Observability eXperiment eNginE）是一种用于Kubernetes微服务的能源实验引擎，能够量化服务级别的计算、网络和存储能源。研究表明，忽略网络和存储会导致辅助服务能源低估高达63%，高追踪负载会将能源主导转向网络和存储。

Abstract: Recent advancements enable fine-grained energy measurements in cloud-native environments (e.g., at container or process level) beyond traditional coarse-grained scopes. However, service-level energy measurement for microservice-based applications remains underexplored. Such measurements must include compute, network, and storage energy to avoid underestimating consumption in distributed setups. We present GOXN (Green Observability eXperiment eNginE), an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes-based microservices that quantifies compute, network, and storage energy at the service level. Using GOXN, we evaluated the OpenTelemetry Demo under varying configurations (monitoring, tracing, service mesh) and steady synthetic load, collecting metrics from Kepler and cAdvisor. Our additive energy model derives service-level energy from container-level data. Results show that excluding network and storage can underestimate auxiliary-service energy by up to 63%, and that high tracing loads shift energy dominance toward network and storage.

Motivation: SBD在基于样本的量子对角化（SQD）中起核心作用，其中在选定配置子空间中对哈密顿量的迭代对角化形成主要的经典计算负载。

Method: 通过围绕细粒度数据并行原语和扁平化的GPU友好数据布局重构关键组件（包括配置处理、激发生成和矩阵-向量操作），提出了基于Thrust库的GPU加速SBD实现。

Result: 实验表明，基于Thrust的SBD比CPU执行速度提升高达40倍，并显著减少了SQD迭代的总运行时间。

Conclusion: GPU-native并行原语为加速基于SQD的量子-经典工作流程提供了简单、可移植且高性能的基础。

Abstract: Selected Basis Diagonalization (SBD) plays a central role in Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD), where iterative diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in selected configuration subspaces forms the dominant classical workload. We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of SBD using the Thrust library. By restructuring key components -- including configuration processing, excitation generation, and matrix-vector operations -- around fine-grained data-parallel primitives and flattened GPU-friendly data layouts, the proposed approach efficiently exploits modern GPU architectures. In our experiments, the Thrust-based SBD achieves up to $\sim$40$\times$ speedup over CPU execution and substantially reduces the total runtime of SQD iterations. These results demonstrate that GPU-native parallel primitives provide a simple, portable, and high-performance foundation for accelerating SQD-based quantum-classical workflows.

TL;DR: DataStates-LLM是一种新型检查点架构，通过异步快照和优化数据移动，显著提升大规模LLM训练的检查点效率和训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检查点解决方案将模型状态视为不透明的二进制数据，忽略了数据结构的3D异构性，导致运行时开销大。

Method: 提出DataStates-LLM架构，利用State Providers解耦状态抽象与数据移动，实现非阻塞异步快照，并优化碎片化异构分片的合并与元数据序列化。

Result: 在256个A100-40GB GPU上测试70B参数模型，DataStates-LLM的检查点吞吐量提升4倍，端到端训练时间减少2.2倍。

Conclusion: DataStates-LLM通过引入State Providers，有效解决了大规模LLM训练中的检查点序列化和异构性问题，显著提升了检查点吞吐量和训练效率。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Transformer-based models, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), now scaling to trillions of parameters, has necessitated training across thousands of GPUs using complex hybrid parallelism strategies (e.g., data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism). Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.

Conclusion: 研究强调了内容感知网络作为新兴无线系统关键推动者的潜力，通过利用多用户内容多样性，显著提升了用户体验容量、公平性和网络利用率。

Abstract: Immersive applications such as eXtended Reality (XR), cloud gaming, and real-time video streaming are central to the vision of 6G networks. These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于深度强化学习的无人机辅助数据收集和无线能量传输方案，在提高数据收集量、公平性和降低无人机能耗方面优于基准方案。

Abstract: The development of wireless power transfer (WPT) and Internet of Things (IoT) offers significant potential but faces challenges such as limited energy supply, dynamic environmental changes, and unstable transmission links. This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT scheme to support batteryless sensor (BLS) networks in remote areas. In this system, BLSs harvest energy from the UAV and utilize the harvested energy to transmit the collected data back to the UAV. The goal is to maximize the collected data volume and fairness index while minimizing the UAV energy consumption. To achieve these objectives, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV trajectory. Due to the non-convexity and dynamic nature of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, this algorithm integrates prioritized experience replay and the performer module to enhance system stability and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of collected data volume, fairness, and UAV energy consumption.

Abstract: Emerging safety-critical Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications require networks to proactively adapt to rapid environmental changes rather than merely reacting to them. While Network Digital Twins (NDTs) offer a pathway to such predictive capabilities, existing solutions typically struggle to reconcile high-fidelity physical modeling with strict real-time constraints. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail. Furthermore, we quantify the fundamental trade-offs between digital model fidelity, computational latency, and trajectory prediction horizons, proving that high-fidelity and predictive digital twins are feasible in real-world urban environments.

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables AI inference at the network edge, co-located with or near the radio access network, rather than in centralized clouds or on mobile devices. It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings.

Conclusion: 802.11网络在支持多用户VR流媒体时存在性能异常，但通过Intra-refresh (IR)编码可以有效降低延迟变异性并提升QoS，最多支持4个并发VR用户（100 Mbps恒定比特率）。

Abstract: Cloud-based Virtual Reality (VR) streaming presents significant challenges for 802.11 networks due to its high throughput and low latency requirements. When multiple VR users share a Wi-Fi network, the resulting uplink and downlink traffic can quickly saturate the channel. This paper investigates the capacity of 802.11 networks for supporting realistic VR streaming workloads across varying frame rates, bitrates, codec settings, and numbers of users. We develop an emulation framework that reproduces Air Light VR (ALVR) operation, where real HEVC video traffic is fed into an 802.11 simulation model. Our findings explore Wi-Fi's performance anomaly and demonstrate that Intra-refresh (IR) coding effectively reduces latency variability and improves QoS, supporting up to 4 concurrent VR users with Constant Bitrate (CBR) 100 Mbps before the channel is saturated.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and scalable screw-theoretic multibody synthesis framework for PDE-based dynamic modeling of serial robotic manipulators with an arbitrary number of flexible links in three-dimensional space. The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established.

Abstract: This paper presents the DMV-AVP System, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: Simulating and validating coordination among multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a challenging task as most existing simulation architectures are limited to single-vehicle operation or rely on centralized control. This paper presents a Distributed Multi-AV Architecture (DMAVA) that enables synchronized, real-time autonomous driving simulation across multiple physical hosts. Each vehicle runs its own complete AV stack and operates independently from other AVs. The vehicles in the simulation maintain synchronized coordination through a low-latency data-centric communication layer. The proposed system integrates ROS 2 Humble, Autoware Universe, AWSIM Labs, and Zenoh to support concurrent execution of multiple Autoware stacks within a shared Unity-based environment. Experiments conducted on multiple-host configurations demonstrate stable localization, reliable inter-host communication, and fully synchronized closed-loop control. The DMAVA also serves as a foundation for Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking, demonstrating its extensibility toward higher-level cooperative autonomy.

Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial GNSS-based orbit and clock estimation framework for lunar navigation satellites. To enable high-precision estimation under the low-observability conditions encountered at lunar distances, we develop a stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother that provide enhanced numerical stability when processing precise time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model is formulated, explicitly accounting for relativistic coupling between orbital and clock states, lunar time-scale transformations, and signal propagation delays including ionospheric, plasmaspheric, and Shapiro effects. The proposed approach is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating realistic multi-constellation GNSS geometry, broadcast ephemeris errors, lunar satellite dynamics, and ionospheric and plasmaspheric delay computed from empirical electron density models. Simulation results demonstrate that combining ionosphere-free pseudorange and TDCP measurements achieves meter-level orbit accuracy and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy, satisfying the stringent signal-in-space error requirements of future Lunar Augmented Navigation Services (LANS).

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于SAC强化学习的能量感知CPP框架在农业机器人中表现出色，覆盖率和能源安全性均优于传统启发式算法，验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is a fundamental capability for agricultural robots; however, existing solutions often overlook energy constraints, resulting in incomplete operations in large-scale or resource-limited environments. This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%. These findings validate the proposed SAC-based framework as an effective and scalable solution for energy-constrained CPP in agricultural robotics.

The platform, based on the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab) [1], integrates simulation, a high-fidelity digital twin, and a physical testbed, enabling structured zero-shot evaluation of MARL motion-planning policies. We demonstrate its use by deploying a SigmaRL-trained policy [2] across all three domains, revealing two complementary sources of performance degradation: architectural differences between simulation and hardware control stacks, and the sim-to-real gap induced by increasing environmental realism. The open-source setup enables systematic analysis of sim-to-real challenges in MARL under realistic, reproducible conditions.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种统一的工业机器人静态校准方法，通过单一实验识别包括几何和非几何效应的机器人模型，显著提高了定位精度。

Abstract: Researchers have identified various sources of tool positioning errors for articulated industrial robots and have proposed dedicated compensation strategies. However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration.

Conclusion: ReViP框架通过视觉-本体感觉再平衡有效减少了错误完成率，并在多个基准测试和实际应用中提高了成功率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by combining vision, language, and proprioception to predict actions. However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

Abstract: The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under simultaneous proximity regulation and safety constraints. We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Orb-weaving spiders detect prey on a web using vibration sensors at leg joints. They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web.

Motivation: Accurate prediction of joint torques is essential for personalized assistance in robot-assisted rehabilitation.

Method: A feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel sEMG signals was integrated into MLP and TCN models to predict joint torques. Data were collected from a single subject under three load conditions, with reference torques estimated from kinematics.

Result: MLP achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m (elbow), 1.403 N m (front-shoulder), and 1.434 N m (side-shoulder), comparable to TCN performance.

Conclusion: The proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to TCN, making it suitable for applications with limited training data, such as patient care.

Abstract: Robot-assisted rehabilitation offers an effective approach, wherein exoskeletons adapt to users' needs and provide personalized assistance. However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful framework for solving complex sequential decision-making problems, particularly in robotic control. However, its practical deployment is often hindered by the substantial amount of experience required for learning, which results in high computational and time costs. In this work, we propose a novel integration of DRL with semantic knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), aiming to enhance learning efficiency by providing contextual information to the agent. Our architecture combines KGEs with visual observations, enabling the agent to exploit environmental knowledge during training. Experimental validation with robotic manipulators in environments featuring both fixed and randomized target attributes demonstrates that our method achieves up to {60}{\%} reduction in learning time and improves task accuracy by approximately 15 percentage points, without increasing training time or computational complexity. These results highlight the potential of semantic knowledge to reduce sample complexity and improve the effectiveness of DRL in robotic applications.

Abstract: Integrated control of wheelchairs and wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) has strong potential to increase independence for users with severe motor limitations, yet existing interfaces often lack the flexibility needed for intuitive assistive interaction. Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control.

Abstract: We consider the problems of computing maximal palindromes and distinct palindromes in a trie. A trie is a natural generalization of a string, which can be seen as a single-path tree. There is a linear-time offline algorithm to compute maximal palindromes and distinct palindromes in a given (static) trie whose edge-labels are drawn from a linearly-sortable alphabet [Mieno et al., ISAAC 2022]. In this paper, we tackle problems of palindrome enumeration on dynamic tries which support leaf additions and leaf deletions. We propose the first sub-quadratic algorithms to enumerate palindromes in a dynamic trie. For maximal palindromes, we propose an algorithm that runs in $O(N \min(\log h, σ))$ time and uses $O(N)$ space, where $N$ is the maximum number of edges in the trie, $σ$ is the size of the alphabet, and $h$ is the height of the trie. For distinct palindromes, we develop several online algorithms based on different algorithmic frameworks, including approaches using the EERTREE (a.k.a. palindromic tree) and the suffix tree of a trie. These algorithms support leaf insertions and deletions in the trie and achieve different time and space trade-offs. Furthermore, as a by-product, we present online algorithms to construct the suffix tree and the EERTREE of the input trie, which is of independent interest.

TL;DR: 论文证明了在超立方体图中，即使存在大量重叠稀疏割，仍能通过随机采样边恢复所有坐标割，且恢复是渐近最优的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在期望图中存在大量重叠稀疏割的情况下，是否仍能恢复社区结构，特别是在超立方体图等复杂结构中。

Method: 结合Friedgut、Kalai和Naor关于布尔函数的傅里叶变换集中在傅里叶谱第一层的定理，以及Karger的割计数论证，提出了一种强超立方体割稀疏化界限。

Result: 在超立方体图的随机样本中，当边出现概率p=C log d/d时，稀疏平衡割与坐标割的差距为1/poly(d)，且可以同时近似恢复所有d个割。

Conclusion: 在超立方体图中，即使在存在大量重叠稀疏割的情况下，仍然可以通过随机采样边来恢复所有d个坐标割，且恢复是渐近最优的。

Abstract: The problem of recovering planted community structure in random graphs has received a lot of attention in the literature on the stochastic block model, where the input is a random graph in which edges crossing between different communities appear with smaller probability than edges induced by communities. The communities themselves form a collection of vertex-disjoint sparse cuts in the expected graph, and can be recovered, often exactly, from a sample as long as a separation condition on the intra- and inter-community edge probabilities is satisfied.
  In this paper, we ask whether the presence of a large number of overlapping sparsest cuts in the expected graph still allows recovery. For example, the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph admits $d$ distinct (balanced) sparsest cuts, one for every coordinate. Can these cuts be identified given a random sample of the edges of the hypercube where each edge is present independently with some probability $p\in (0, 1)$? We show that this is the case, in a very strong sense: the sparsest balanced cut in a sample of the hypercube at rate $p=C\log d/d$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$ is $1/\text{poly}(d)$-close to a coordinate cut with high probability. This is asymptotically optimal and allows approximate recovery of all $d$ cuts simultaneously. Furthermore, for an appropriate sample of hypercube-like graphs recovery can be made exact. The proof is essentially a strong hypercube cut sparsification bound that combines a theorem of Friedgut, Kalai and Naor on boolean functions whose Fourier transform concentrates on the first level of the Fourier spectrum with Karger's cut counting argument.

TL;DR: 本文解决了Maximum $k$-Coverage的两个关键问题，提出了针对Partial $k$-Dominating Set的条件最优算法，并证明了基于自然参数的复杂时间界限也是最优的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视Maximum $k$-Coverage问题，探索在参数$t$较小情况下是否能改进时间界限，并试图确定基于自然参数$u$、$s$、$f$的最佳可能运行时间。

Method: 针对Partial $k$-Dominating Set，提出了基于矩阵乘法指数$ω$的时间复杂度算法；针对Maximum $k$-Coverage，设计了一个结合参数$f$、$u$、$s$的复杂时间界限算法。

Result: 提出了Partial $k$-Dominating Set的条件最优时间算法，并证明了Maximum $k$-Coverage的复杂时间界限也是条件最优的。

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了关于Maximum $k$-Coverage问题的两个关键问题，提出了针对Partial $k$-Dominating Set的条件最优时间算法，并针对Maximum $k$-Coverage设计了一个复杂但条件最优的时间界限算法。

Abstract: We revisit the classic Maximum $k$-Coverage problem: Determine the largest number $t$ of elements that can be covered by choosing $k$ sets from a given family $\mathcal{F} = \{S_1,\dots, S_n\}$ of a size-$u$ universe. A notable special case is Partial $k$-Dominating Set, where one chooses $k$ vertices in a graph to maximize the number of dominated vertices.
  Extensive research has established strong hardness results for various aspects of Maximum $k$-Coverage, such as tight inapproximability results, $W[2]$-hardness, and a conditionally tight worst-case running time of $n^{k\pm o(1)}$. In this paper we ask: (1) Can this time bound be improved for small $t$, at least for Partial $k$-Dominating Set, ideally to time~$t^{k\pm O(1)}$? (2) More ambitiously, can we even determine the best-possible running time of Maximum $k$-Coverage with respect to the perhaps most natural parameters: the universe size $u$, the maximum set size $s$, and the maximum frequency $f$?
  We successfully resolve both questions. (1) We give an algorithm that solves Partial $k$-Dominating Set in time $O(nt + t^{\frac{2ω}{3} k+O(1)})$ if $ω\ge 2.25$ and time $O(nt+ t^{\frac{3}{2} k+O(1)})$ if $ω\le 2.25$, where $ω\le 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. From this we derive a time bound that is conditionally optimal, regardless of $ω$, based on the well-established $k$-clique and 3-uniform hyperclique hypotheses from fine-grained complexity. We also obtain matching upper and lower bounds for sparse graphs. To address (2) we design an algorithm for Maximum $k$-Coverage running in time
  $$
  \min \left\{ (f\cdot \min\{\sqrt[3]{u}, \sqrt{s}\})^k + \min\{n,f\cdot \min\{\sqrt{u}, s\}\}^{kω/3}, n^k\right\}
  \cdot g(k)n^{\pm O(1)}, $$ and, surprisingly, further show that this complicated time bound is also conditionally optimal.

TL;DR: VIBETENSOR是一个由AI生成的深度学习系统软件栈，展示了编码代理在高层次人类指导下生成从语言绑定到CUDA内存管理的连贯运行时。系统通过构建和测试验证，并报告了性能测试结果和训练验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VIBETENSOR旨在展示AI辅助软件工程的潜力，通过LLM驱动的编码代理在高层次人类指导下生成深度学习系统软件栈。

Method: VIBETENSOR实现了一个PyTorch风格的eager tensor库，包括C++20核心（CPU+CUDA）、基于nanobind的Python覆盖层，以及实验性的Node.js/TypeScript接口。系统还包括自己的tensor/storage系统、schema-lite调度器、反向模式自动微分、CUDA运行时、流有序缓存分配器，以及用于动态加载操作符插件的稳定C ABI。

Result: VIBETENSOR成功实现了从语言绑定到CUDA内存管理的深度学习运行时，并通过构建和测试验证了其功能。此外，还报告了仓库规模、测试套件组成、可复现的微基准测试结果，以及在NVIDIA H100和Blackwell-class GPU上的端到端训练验证。

Conclusion: VIBETENSOR的发布标志着AI辅助软件工程的一个重要里程碑，展示了编码代理能够生成从语言绑定到CUDA内存管理的连贯深度学习运行时，并通过构建和测试进行验证。

Abstract: VIBETENSOR is an open-source research system software stack for deep learning, generated by LLM-powered coding agents under high-level human guidance. In this paper, "fully generated" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support. Finally, we discuss failure modes in generated system software, including a "Frankenstein" composition effect where locally correct subsystems interact to yield globally suboptimal performance.

TL;DR: 测试与证明互补，结合契约式设计和SMT反例生成，提升软件验证与维护效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨测试与证明在软件验证中的互补性，以解决传统对立视角下的局限性。

Method: 利用Eiffel的契约式设计和基于SMT的工具的反例生成机制，将反例转化为自动测试用例或修复程序的依据。

Result: 实现了自动测试生成、回归测试套件构建及程序修复，并确保修复的正确性。

Conclusion: 测试和证明是互补而非对立的软件验证技术，结合Eiffel的契约式设计和SMT工具的反例生成，可显著提升软件质量、维护和自动修复的效率。

Abstract: Test or prove? These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.
  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation. We can also introduce faults into a correct program and turn the counterexamples into an automatically generated regression test suite with full coverage. Additionally, we can use these mechanisms to help produce program fixes for incorrect programs, with a guarantee that the fixes are correct. All three applications, leveraging on the mechanisms of Eiffel and Design by Contract, hold significant promise to address some of the challenges of program testing, software maintenance and Automatic Program Repair.

*Shuai Shao,Lu Xiao,Tingting Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于语言模式的框架，自动识别并发错误报告，通过微调PLMs显著提升分类精度，为并发错误分类的自动化和可解释性提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多核架构的普及，并发系统变得至关重要，但也更容易出现数据竞争和死锁等复杂问题。手动标记并发相关错误报告是一项劳动密集且容易出错的任务，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 从730个手动标记的并发错误报告中提取58种不同的语言模式，分为四个层次：单词级（关键词）、短语级（n-grams）、句子级（语义）和错误报告级（上下文）。评估了四种互补方法：匹配、学习、基于提示和微调，涵盖传统机器学习、大语言模型（LLMs）和预训练语言模型（PLMs）。

Result: 在12个大型开源项目（来自GitHub和Jira的10,920个问题报告）上的综合评估表明，使用语言模式增强输入微调PLMs效果最佳，GitHub上精度达91%，Jira上达93%，且在截止后数据上保持高精度（91%）。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一个基于语言模式的框架，结合领域特定语言知识微调预训练语言模型（PLMs），显著提高了并发错误报告分类的自动化、精确性和可解释性。

Abstract: With the growing ubiquity of multi-core architectures, concurrent systems have become essential but increasingly prone to complex issues such as data races and deadlocks. While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research. Together, these advances provide a foundation for improving the automation, precision, and interpretability of concurrency bug classification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统级框架来分析软件工程研究领域的挑战，强调需要协调性改革而非孤立修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程研究领域面临诸多挑战（如评审过程负担、指标驱动的激励机制、扭曲的出版实践等），这些问题源于研究生态系统内部的结构性动态，需要系统级的解决方案。

Method: 通过借鉴复杂系统、生态系统和变革理论的思想，构建了一个框架来分析软件工程研究生态系统的结构性动态。

Result: 通过系统级视角的分析，揭示了维持当前功能障碍的非线性反馈循环，并识别了改革的杠杆点。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种系统级的视角来应对软件工程研究领域面临的挑战，强调了协调性改革的重要性。

Abstract: The software engineering research community is productive, yet it faces a constellation of challenges: swamped review processes, metric-driven incentives, distorted publication practices, and increasing pressures from AI, scale, and outright scams. These issues are often treated in isolation, yet they arise from deep structural dynamics within the research ecosystem itself and distract us from the larger role of research in society. Meaningful progress requires a holistic system-level view. We sketch such a framework drawing on ideas from complex systems, ecosystems, and theory of change. Reframing SE's challenges through this lens reveals non-linear feedback loops that sustain current dysfunctions, and it helps to identify leverage points for reform. These are less a matter of isolated fixes and more a matter of exploring coordinated sets of fixes that operate across the SE ecosystem

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理型AI的出现，软件工程正在向3.0时代转型，软件项目管理（SPM）也需要相应演进，以促进项目成功完成，同时保持人类的核心地位。

Method: 基于初步的‘agentic SPM’理念和支持文献，提出了四种工作模式，具有不同自主级别，以应对SPM任务中的伦理、责任和信任问题。

Result: 提出了‘Agentic PM’的概念，并介绍了其作为‘初级项目经理’或‘实习项目经理’与软件团队协作的四种工作模式。

Conclusion: 本文提出了‘Agentic Project Manager (PM)’作为SPM 3.0的多智能体系统，并探讨了人类PM角色向‘战略领导者’和‘教练’的演变，同时为更广泛的研究社区提出了研究议程。

Abstract: With the advent of agentic AI, Software Engineering is transforming to a new era dubbed Software Engineering 3.0. Software project management (SPM) must also evolve with such transformations to boost successful project completion, while keeping humans at the heart of it. Building on our preliminary ideas of "agentic SPM", and supporting literature, we present our vision of an "Agentic Project Manager (PM)" as a multi-agent system for SPM 3.0. They will work like a "junior project manager", or an "intern project manager" collaboratively with software teams. We introduce four working modes, with varying autonomy levels to choose from, based on the SPM task. This addresses concerns with ethics, accountability, and trust related to agentic PMs. We also share insights on human PM role evolution and new skill requirements as a "strategic leader" and a "coach" for humans and agents. While creating the foundation for agentic SPM research, we present a research agenda for the wider research community.

Motivation: 程序员依赖AI编程助手解答代码问题，但缺乏可靠的基准来评估这些系统的性能。

Method: 通过从Github拉取请求评论中提取真实世界的上下文问题，构建了一个多语言基准，并设计了详细的评分标准来评估答案。

Result: 评估了20种LLM（包括专有和开源模型），发现即使是先进模型也无法在基准测试中给出一致且正确的回答，且模型表现与成本无关。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了RubberDuckBench作为一个多语言代码问题基准，旨在推动未来可信且正确的AI编程助手研究。

Abstract: Programmers are turning to AI coding assistants to answer questions about their code. Benchmarks are needed to soundly evaluate these systems and understand their performance. To enable such a study, we curate a benchmark of real-world contextualized questions derived from Github pull request comments. Out of this work, we present RubberDuckBench: a multilingual benchmark of questions about code, along with detailed rubrics for evaluating answers. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 LLMs (proprietary & open-source) on answering these questions. We find that even state of the art models fail to give consistent, correct responses across the benchmark. Grok 4 (69.29%), Claude Opus 4 (68.5%), and GPT-5 (67.8%) perform best overall, but do not exhibit pairwise significant superiority over the next 9 best performing models. Most models obtain points through partial credit, with the best performing models only answering at most 2 questions completely correctly across all trials. Furthermore, models often hallucinate with lies in 58.3\% of responses on average. Cost analysis reveals no correlation between expense (API pricing or parameter count) and performance. We intend this benchmark to be a target for future research in trustworthy and correct AI coding assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源生态系统（如NPM和PyPI）日益成为供应链攻击的目标，现有检测方法要么依赖于脆弱的手工规则，要么依赖于无法捕捉不断演变的攻击语义的数据驱动特征。

Method: IntelGuard构建了一个包含8000多份威胁情报报告的结构化知识库，将恶意代码片段与行为描述和专家推理联系起来。在分析新软件包时，它检索语义相似的恶意示例，并应用LLM引导的推理来评估代码行为是否符合预期功能。

Result: 在4027个真实软件包的实验中，IntelGuard实现了99%的准确率和0.50%的误报率，同时在混淆代码上保持96.5%的准确率。

Conclusion: IntelGuard在PyPI.org上部署后发现了54个先前未报告的恶意软件包，展示了基于专家知识的可解释和鲁棒性检测能力。

Abstract: Open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI are increasingly targeted by supply chain attacks, yet existing detection methods either depend on fragile handcrafted rules or data-driven features that fail to capture evolving attack semantics. We present IntelGuard, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based framework that integrates expert analytical reasoning into automated malicious package detection. IntelGuard constructs a structured knowledge base from over 8,000 threat intelligence reports, linking malicious code snippets with behavioral descriptions and expert reasoning. When analyzing new packages, it retrieves semantically similar malicious examples and applies LLM-guided reasoning to assess whether code behaviors align with intended functionality. Experiments on 4,027 real-world packages show that IntelGuard achieves 99% accuracy and a 0.50% false positive rate, while maintaining 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code. Deployed on PyPI.org, it discovered 54 previously unreported malicious packages, demonstrating interpretable and robust detection guided by expert knowledge.

Motivation: 由于构建过程的复杂性和低效性，现有方法难以处理复杂错误，导致配置失败。

Method: EvoConfig 是一个高效的环境配置框架，通过优化多智能体协作来构建正确的运行时环境，包含专家诊断模块和自进化机制。

Result: 在 Envbench 上，EvoConfig 实现了 78.1% 的成功率，比 Repo2Run 高出 7.1%，并在错误识别和修复建议方面表现更优。

Conclusion: EvoConfig 不仅匹配了现有最先进方法 Repo2Run 的性能，还在更具挑战性的案例中表现出色，展示了更强的调试能力。

Abstract: A reliable executable environment is the foundation for ensuring that large language models solve software engineering tasks. Due to the complex and tedious construction process, large-scale configuration is relatively inefficient. However, most methods always overlook fine-grained analysis of the actions performed by the agent, making it difficult to handle complex errors and resulting in configuration failures. To address this bottleneck, we propose EvoConfig, an efficient environment configuration framework that optimizes multi-agent collaboration to build correct runtime environments. EvoConfig features an expert diagnosis module for fine-grained post-execution analysis, and a self-evolving mechanism that lets expert agents self-feedback and dynamically adjust error-fixing priorities in real time. Empirically, EvoConfig matches the previous state-of-the-art Repo2Run on Repo2Run's 420 repositories, while delivering clear gains on harder cases: on the more challenging Envbench, EvoConfig achieves a 78.1% success rate, outperforming Repo2Run by 7.1%. Beyond end-to-end success, EvoConfig also demonstrates stronger debugging competence, achieving higher accuracy in error identification and producing more effective repair recommendations than existing methods.

Conclusion: REprompt框架通过结合需求工程原则，有效优化了系统提示和用户提示，提升了基于大型语言模型的智能软件开发效率。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models is transforming software development. Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering. Experiment results demonstrate that REprompt effectively optimizes both system and user prompts by grounding prompt generation in requirements engineering principles.

Result: 代码注释（尤其是描述代码整体目的的注释）显著提升翻译准确性。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了COMMENTRA方法，证明其可以显著提升基于LLM的代码翻译性能。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era in automated code translation across programming languages. Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in terms of its comprehensiveness, scale, and language coverage on how to improve code translation accuracy using code comments.

Motivation: 响应联合国2030年可持续发展议程，研究编程语言和执行模型对软件能源效率的影响，特别是Lua语言在能源效率方面的表现。

Method: 通过对25个官方Lua解释器版本和JIT编译器进行实证研究，使用全面的基准测试套件测量执行时间和能源消耗。

Result: 所有LuaJIT编译器均显著优于标准Lua解释器，最高效的LuaJIT能源消耗减少约7倍，运行速度提升7倍，接近C语言的效率。

Conclusion: LuaJIT编译器在性能和能源效率上显著优于标准Lua解释器，接近C语言的效率，展示了JIT编译在提升解释型语言性能和能源效率方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights the importance of energy-efficient software to reduce the global carbon footprint. Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.
  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter. Moreover, LuaJIT approaches C's efficiency, using roughly six times more energy and running about eight times slower, demonstrating the substantial benefits of JIT compilation for improving both performance and energy efficiency in interpreted languages.

Conclusion: LLM辅助的需求表达方法显著提高了需求的感知完整性、清晰度和一致性，同时通过将利益相关者纳入验证循环，促进了在需求工程中负责任和可信赖的AI使用。

Abstract: Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.

TL;DR: 研究通过访谈和调查发现，德国软件工程师使用GenAI工具时，经验、组织规模和项目意识是关键影响因素，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在德国严格监管环境下（如GDPR和欧盟AI法案），影响GenAI工具有效使用的因素，填补该领域实证研究的空白。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，包括18次探索性访谈和109名开发者的调查问卷。

Result: 经验水平调节了GenAI工具的感知效益，生产力提升不均；组织规模影响工具选择和强度；项目上下文意识不足是主要障碍。

Conclusion: 研究总结了针对开发者、组织和工具供应商的可操作建议，以推动AI辅助软件开发的发展。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have seen rapid adoption among software developers. While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier. We summarize a set of actionable implications for developers, organizations, and tool vendors seeking to advance artificial intelligence (AI) assisted software development.

TL;DR: 研究通过专家访谈揭示了REST API设计指南的挑战和最佳实践，强调指南需与组织需求契合并涉及所有利益相关者，自动化linting可提升合规性和教育效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API设计质量对商业成功至关重要，但现有指南常被认为过于庞大且不实用，导致开发者难以设计有效的API。

Method: 进行了16位REST API专家的访谈研究，探讨了API可用性的概念、指南有效性因素、采用和设计指南的挑战及最佳实践。

Result: 确定了影响REST API可用性的八个因素，其中遵循惯例最为重要。指南确实能提高API可用性，但开发者对严格指南存在显著抵触。

Conclusion: REST API指南的有效性取决于其与组织需求的契合度、指南的规模以及所有利益相关者的参与。自动化linting不仅有助于合规性执行，还能通过教育性解释来证明指南规则的合理性。

Abstract: REST is today's most widely used architectural style for providing web-based services. In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.
  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.

TL;DR: SWE-Pruner 是一种任务感知的代码上下文剪枝框架，通过动态选择相关代码行显著减少令牌使用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法（如 LongLLMLingua）依赖固定指标（如 PPL），忽略了代码理解的任务特异性，导致破坏语法逻辑结构或丢失关键细节。

Method: SWE-Pruner 通过任务感知的自适应剪枝方法，利用轻量级神经筛选器（0.6B 参数）动态选择与任务目标相关的代码行。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SWE-Pruner 实现了 23-54% 的令牌减少（如 SWE-Bench Verified），单轮任务（如 LongCodeQA）压缩比高达 14.84 倍，性能影响最小。

Conclusion: SWE-Pruner 是一种针对编码代理的自适应上下文剪枝框架，有效减少了交互上下文长度，同时保持了关键实现细节，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: LLM agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in software development, but their performance is hampered by long interaction contexts, which incur high API costs and latency. While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.

TL;DR: 基础模型能有效检测和修复由功能可变性引发的编译错误，性能优于传统工具，且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件系统常依赖条件编译支持可选功能和多种部署场景，但特定功能组合下可能引发编译错误，传统编译器难以检测。

Method: 本文评估了GPT-OSS-20B和GEMINI 3 PRO，并与TYPECHEF（一种最先进的可变性感知解析器）进行了比较。评估包括5,000个小型可配置系统和14个真实世界的GitHub提交。

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在小型系统中精度达0.97，召回率0.90，准确率0.94；修复编译错误成功率超70%。在真实提交中，CHATGPT-5.2检测到除两例外所有注入故障，并发现一个潜在的真实编译错误。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的基础模型为传统的可变性感知分析提供了实用且低成本的补充。

Abstract: Modern software systems often rely on conditional compilation to support optional features and multiple deployment scenarios. In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.

TL;DR: AI生成的代码比人类代码更持久，但修改模式不同，组织实践可能是长期维护的关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI代理生成的代码是否如普遍假设那样是‘一次性’的，以及其对组织维护负担的潜在影响。

Method: 通过对201个开源项目中超过20万代码单元的生存分析，比较AI代理与人类编写的代码的修改率和风险。

Result: AI生成的代码在行级别上修改率低15.8%，修改风险低16%，但纠正率略高（26.3% vs. 23.0%）。文本特征可预测易修改代码（AUC-ROC = 0.671），但修改时间预测困难（Macro F1 = 0.285）。

Conclusion: 研究发现AI生成的代码并非‘一次性’，其生存时间显著长于人类代码，但修改模式有所不同。这表明AI代码的长期维护问题可能更多源于组织实践而非生成质量。

Abstract: The integration of AI agents as coding assistants into software development has raised questions about the long-term viability of AI agent-generated code. A prevailing hypothesis within the software engineering community suggests this code is "disposable", meaning it is merged quickly but discarded shortly thereafter. If true, organizations risk shifting maintenance burden from generation to post-deployment remediation. We investigate this hypothesis through survival analysis of 201 open-source projects, tracking over 200,000 code units authored by AI agents versus humans. Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cramér's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI编码代理对构建系统代码质量和可维护性的影响，填补这一关键但未被充分研究的领域。

Method: 利用AIDev数据集，研究了AI编码代理生成的构建代码是否存在质量问题（RQ1）、AI代理消除构建代码中代码异味的能力（RQ2）以及Agentic-PRs被开发者接受的程度（RQ3）。

Result: 识别了364个与可维护性和安全性相关的构建异味，61%以上的Agentic-PRs被批准并合并，且需最少人工干预。

Conclusion: AI生成的构建代码可能引入质量问题，但也可能通过重构消除现有问题。未来需要更多研究来系统评估和指导AI生成的构建系统代码。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI coding agents for software development has raised important questions about the quality and maintainability of the code they produce. While prior studies have examined AI-generated source code, the impact of AI coding agents on build systems-a critical yet understudied component of the software lifecycle-remains largely unexplored. This data mining challenge focuses on AIDev, the first large-scale, openly available dataset capturing agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) from real-world GitHub repositories. Our paper leverages this dataset to investigate (RQ1) whether AI coding agents generate build code with quality issues (e.g., code smells), (RQ2) to what extent AI agents can eliminate code smells from build code, and (RQ3) to what extent Agentic-PRs are accepted by developers. We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties). Notably, more than 61\% of Agentic-PRs are approved and merged with minimal human intervention. This dual impact underscores the need for future research on AI-aware build code quality assessment to systematically evaluate, guide, and govern AI-generated build systems code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AAA游戏中，传统插桩的性能开销与严格的性能要求冲突，且可能导致自动化测试不稳定。

Method: 提出并评估了一种针对大型C++游戏引擎的选择性插桩方法，减少插桩范围但保留与开发者提交相关的覆盖率数据。

Result: 该框架在工业游戏测试流程中表现良好，编译开销极小，性能评估中即使最坏情况下帧率仍保持在非插桩基线的50%以上，且未引发自动化测试失败。

Conclusion: 本文展示了针对大型C++游戏引擎的选择性插桩方法，能够在最小化开销的同时实现提交或构建级别的代码覆盖率，且不损害测试稳定性。

Abstract: Code coverage is a valuable guide for testing, but in AAA games the overhead of instrumentation conflicts with strict performance requirements and can destabilize automated tests. We propose and assess a selective instrumentation approach tailored to large game engines written in \texttt{C++}, which reduces the scope of instrumentation while preserving relevant coverage data to developer commits. Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time. In performance evaluations, even the worst-case scenario maintains frame rates above 50\% of the non-instrumented baseline. Across two production test suites maintained by our industry partner, our framework caused no automated test failures, avoiding the instability observed under full instrumentation. Our work shows that commit-level or build-level coverage of large \texttt{C++} game engines can be achieved with minimal overhead and without compromising test stability.
