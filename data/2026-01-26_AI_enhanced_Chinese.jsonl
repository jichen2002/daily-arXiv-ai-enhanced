The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u87ba\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u67d4\u6027\u94fe\u4e32\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u7684PDE\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u663e\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206-\u4ee3\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u67d4\u6027\u94fe\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u4e2a\u67d4\u6027\u94fe\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u7406\u8bbaPDE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u5173\u8282\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u5728\u4f53\u56fa\u5b9a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u53cc\u87ba\u65cb\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94fe\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u94fe\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f53\u56fa\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u94fe\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u53d8\u91cf\uff0cPDE\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u67ef\u897f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u87ba\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u67d4\u6027\u94fe\u7684\u4e32\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u7684PDE\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\uff08\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\uff09\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u663e\u5f0f\u7d22\u5f15-1\u5fae\u5206-\u4ee3\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002"}}

The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods.

A trie is a natural generalization of a string, which can be seen as a single-path tree. There is a linear-time offline algorithm to compute maximal palindromes and distinct palindromes in a given (static) trie whose edge-labels are drawn from a linearly-sortable alphabet [Mieno et al., ISAAC 2022]. In this paper, we tackle problems of palindrome enumeration on dynamic tries which support leaf additions and leaf deletions. We propose the first sub-quadratic algorithms to enumerate palindromes in a dynamic trie. For maximal palindromes, we propose an algorithm that runs in $O(N \\min(\\log h, \u03c3))$ time and uses $O(N)$ space, where $N$ is the maximum number of edges in the trie, $\u03c3$ is the size of the alphabet, and $h$ is the height of the trie. For distinct palindromes, we develop several online algorithms based on different algorithmic frameworks, including approaches using the EERTREE (a.k.a. palindromic tree) and the suffix tree of a trie. These algorithms support leaf insertions and deletions in the trie and achieve different time and space trade-offs.

Modern platforms with matrix multiplication accelerators exhibit high FLOP/Byte machine balance, which makes implementing optimal matrix multiplication challenging. On modern CPU platforms with matrix engines, state-of-the-art vendor libraries tune input tensor layouts, parallelization schemes, and cache blocking to minimize data movement across the memory hierarchy and maximize throughput. However, the best settings for these parameters depend strongly on the target platform (number of cores, memory hierarchy, cache sizes) and on the shapes of the matrices, making exhaustive tuning infeasible; in practice this leads to performance \"glass jaws\". In this work we revisit space filling curves (SFC) to alleviate the problem of this cumbersome tuning. SFC convert multi-dimensional coordinates (e.g. 2D) into a single dimension (1D), keeping nearby points in the high-dimensional space close in the 1D order. We partition the Matrix Multiplication computation space using recent advancements in generalized SFC (Generalized Hilbert Curves), and we obtain platform-oblivious and shape-oblivious matrix-multiplication schemes that exhibit inherently high degree of data locality. Furthermore, we extend the SFC-based work partitioning to implement Communication-Avoiding (CA) algorithms that replicate the input tensors and provably minimize communication/data-movement on the critical path.

Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u623f\u95f4\u89c4\u6a213D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6b20\u5b9a\u6216\u75c5\u6001\u7684\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u70bc\u52303D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u623f\u95f4\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u76843D\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6e32\u67d3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u70bc\u52303D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u63a73D\u91cd\u65b0\u7167\u660e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

In this paper, \"fully generated\" refers to code provenance: implementation changes were produced and applied as agent-proposed diffs; validation relied on agent-run builds, tests, and differential checks, without per-change manual diff review. It implements a PyTorch-style eager tensor library with a C++20 core (CPU+CUDA), a torch-like Python overlay via nanobind, and an experimental Node.js/TypeScript interface. Unlike thin bindings, VIBETENSOR includes its own tensor/storage system, schema-lite dispatcher, reverse-mode autograd, CUDA runtime (streams/events/graphs), a stream-ordered caching allocator with diagnostics, and a stable C ABI for dynamically loaded operator plugins. We view this release as a milestone for AI-assisted software engineering: it shows coding agents can generate a coherent deep learning runtime spanning language bindings down to CUDA memory management, validated primarily by builds and tests. We describe the architecture, summarize the workflow used to produce and validate the system, and evaluate the artifact. We report repository scale and test-suite composition, and summarize reproducible microbenchmarks from an accompanying AI-generated kernel suite, including fused attention versus PyTorch SDPA/FlashAttention. We also report end-to-end training sanity checks on 3 small workloads (sequence reversal, ViT, miniGPT) on NVIDIA H100 (Hopper, SM90) and Blackwell-class GPUs; multi-GPU results are Blackwell-only and use an optional CUTLASS-based ring-allreduce plugin gated on CUDA 13+ and sm103a toolchain support.

This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%.

This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT scheme to support batteryless sensor (BLS) networks in remote areas. In this system, BLSs harvest energy from the UAV and utilize the harvested energy to transmit the collected data back to the UAV. The goal is to maximize the collected data volume and fairness index while minimizing the UAV energy consumption. To achieve these objectives, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV trajectory. Due to the non-convexity and dynamic nature of the problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is proposed to solve the problem.

The communities themselves form a collection of vertex-disjoint sparse cuts in the expected graph, and can be recovered, often exactly, from a sample as long as a separation condition on the intra- and inter-community edge probabilities is satisfied.\n  In this paper, we ask whether the presence of a large number of overlapping sparsest cuts in the expected graph still allows recovery. For example, the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph admits $d$ distinct (balanced) sparsest cuts, one for every coordinate. Can these cuts be identified given a random sample of the edges of the hypercube where each edge is present independently with some probability $p\\in (0, 1)$? We show that this is the case, in a very strong sense: the sparsest balanced cut in a sample of the hypercube at rate $p=C\\log d/d$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$ is $1/\\text{poly}(d)$-close to a coordinate cut with high probability. This is asymptotically optimal and allows approximate recovery of all $d$ cuts simultaneously. Furthermore, for an appropriate sample of hypercube-like graphs recovery can be made exact. The proof is essentially a strong hypercube cut sparsification bound that combines a theorem of Friedgut, Kalai and Naor on boolean functions whose Fourier transform concentrates on the first level of the Fourier spectrum with Karger's cut counting argument.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u7a00\u758f\u5272\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u8fb9\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709\u5750\u6807\u5272\uff0c\u4e14\u6062\u590d\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u671f\u671b\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u7a00\u758f\u5272\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Friedgut\u3001Kalai\u548cNaor\u5173\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caKarger\u7684\u5272\u8ba1\u6570\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5272\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u8fb9\u51fa\u73b0\u6982\u7387p=C log d/d\u65f6\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5e73\u8861\u5272\u4e0e\u5750\u6807\u5272\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3a1/poly(d)\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709d\u4e2a\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u7a00\u758f\u5272\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u8fb9\u6765\u6062\u590d\u6240\u6709d\u4e2a\u5750\u6807\u5272\uff0c\u4e14\u6062\u590d\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002"}}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

These two approaches to software verification have long been presented as opposites. One is dynamic, the other static: a test executes the program, a proof only analyzes the program text. A different perspective is emerging, in which testing and proving are complementary rather than competing techniques for producing software of verified quality.\n  Work performed over the past few years and reviewed here develops this complementarity by taking advantage of Design by Contract, as available in Eiffel, and exploiting a feature of modern program-proving tools based on ``Satisfiability Modulo Theories'' (SMT): counterexample generation. A counterexample is an input combination that makes the program fail. If we are trying to prove a program correct, we hope not to find any. One can, however, apply counterexample generation to incorrect programs, as a tool for automatic test generation.

This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail.

A notable special case is Partial $k$-Dominating Set, where one chooses $k$ vertices in a graph to maximize the number of dominated vertices.\n  Extensive research has established strong hardness results for various aspects of Maximum $k$-Coverage, such as tight inapproximability results, $W[2]$-hardness, and a conditionally tight worst-case running time of $n^{k\\pm o(1)}$. In this paper we ask: (1) Can this time bound be improved for small $t$, at least for Partial $k$-Dominating Set, ideally to time~$t^{k\\pm O(1)}$? (2) More ambitiously, can we even determine the best-possible running time of Maximum $k$-Coverage with respect to the perhaps most natural parameters: the universe size $u$, the maximum set size $s$, and the maximum frequency $f$?\n  We successfully resolve both questions. (1) We give an algorithm that solves Partial $k$-Dominating Set in time $O(nt + t^{\\frac{2\u03c9}{3} k+O(1)})$ if $\u03c9\\ge 2.25$ and time $O(nt+ t^{\\frac{3}{2} k+O(1)})$ if $\u03c9\\le 2.25$, where $\u03c9\\le 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. From this we derive a time bound that is conditionally optimal, regardless of $\u03c9$, based on the well-established $k$-clique and 3-uniform hyperclique hypotheses from fine-grained complexity. We also obtain matching upper and lower bounds for sparse graphs.

However, its efficient deployment on Huawei's Ascend 910 Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is challenging due to limited native mixed-precision support and the accelerator's decoupled compute architecture. To enable quantization on such architecture, we present the first practical W4A16 matrix multiplication kernel tailored for the Ascend 910 NPU. Our design leverages vector cores for on-the-fly INT4-to-FP16 dequantization, cube cores for high-throughput GEMM, and Split-K parallelization to mitigate memory latency. Performance evaluations across diverse matrix shapes and batch sizes show our method outperforms data-parallel approaches when K >> N, a typical scenario in LLM decoding. Specially, our method can achieve a speedup ranging from 1.01x to 1.74x. In addition, our profile reveals the primary bottleneck is not dequantization compution itself, but extra global memory transfer for the weight, making W4A16 only reaching a maximum speedup of 1.48x over native FP16xFP16 matrix multiplication in PyTorch.

Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding.

To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks.

However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task.

While modern issue-tracking systems facilitate the reporting of such problems, labeling concurrency-related bug reports remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task. This paper presents a linguistic-pattern-based framework for automatically identifying concurrency bug reports. We derive 58 distinct linguistic patterns from 730 manually labeled concurrency bug reports, organized across four levels: word-level (keywords), phrase-level (n-grams), sentence-level (semantic), and bug report-level (contextual). To assess their effectiveness, we evaluate four complementary approaches-matching, learning, prompt-based, and fine-tuning-spanning traditional machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and pre-trained language models (PLMs). Our comprehensive evaluation on 12 large-scale open-source projects (10,920 issue reports from GitHub and Jira) demonstrates that fine-tuning PLMs with linguistic-pattern-enriched inputs achieves the best performance, reaching a precision of 91% on GitHub and 93% on Jira, and maintaining strong precision on post cut-off data (91%). The contributions of this work include: (1) a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic patterns for concurrency bugs, (2) a novel fine-tuning strategy that integrates domain-specific linguistic knowledge into PLMs, and (3) a curated, labeled dataset to support reproducible research.

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend. Densification reduces computational costs only when frequency reuse scales with base-station density; otherwise, sparser deployments improve fairness and efficiency in interference-limited settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6392\u961f\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5927\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6cca\u677e\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u961f\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9645AI\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5378\u8f7d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u51f8\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u8702\u7a9d\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u8f93\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8702\u7a9d\u5219\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u4ec5\u5728\u9891\u7387\u91cd\u7528\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ad9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u6392\u961f\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002"}}

However, service-level energy measurement for microservice-based applications remains underexplored. Such measurements must include compute, network, and storage energy to avoid underestimating consumption in distributed setups. We present GOXN (Green Observability eXperiment eNginE), an energy experimentation engine for Kubernetes-based microservices that quantifies compute, network, and storage energy at the service level. Using GOXN, we evaluated the OpenTelemetry Demo under varying configurations (monitoring, tracing, service mesh) and steady synthetic load, collecting metrics from Kepler and cAdvisor. Our additive energy model derives service-level energy from container-level data. Results show that excluding network and storage can underestimate auxiliary-service energy by up to 63%, and that high tracing loads shift energy dominance toward network and storage.", "AI": {"tldr": "GOXN\u662f\u4e00\u79cdKubernetes\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u6e90\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u6e90\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5ffd\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u6e90\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u8fbe63%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u80fd\u6e90\u6d4b\u91cf\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u80fd\u6e90\u6d4b\u91cf\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5305\u62ec\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u6e90\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\u3002", "method": "GOXN\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceKepler\u548ccAdvisor\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6cd5\u80fd\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528GOXN\u8bc4\u4f30OpenTelemetry Demo\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u7f51\u683c\uff09\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5ffd\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f85\u52a9\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u6e90\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u8fbe63%\uff0c\u9ad8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f1a\u5c06\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "conclusion": "GOXN\uff08Green Observability eXperiment eNginE\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eKubernetes\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u80fd\u6e90\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f85\u52a9\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u6e90\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u8fbe63%\uff0c\u9ad8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f1a\u5c06\u80fd\u6e90\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f6c\u5411\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u3002"}}

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Doc2AHP\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cAHP\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528AHP\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u539f\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u9650\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7236\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "Doc2AHP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5934\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Doc2AHP\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548cAHP\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources.

However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $\u03bcm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $\u03bcm$ for purely geometric calibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8865\u507f\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5173\u8282\u589e\u5f3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u94fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728KUKA KR30\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece102.3 \u03bcm\u964d\u4f4e\u81f326.8 \u03bcm\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9759\u6001\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution.

However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop.

Checkpointing this massive, distributed state is critical for a wide range of use cases, such as resilience, suspend-resume, investigating undesirable training trajectories, and explaining model evolution. However, existing checkpointing solutions typically treat model state as opaque binary blobs, ignoring the ``3D heterogeneity'' of the underlying data structures--varying by memory location (GPU vs. Host), number of ``logical'' objects sharded and split across multiple files, data types (tensors vs. Python objects), and their serialization requirements. This results in significant runtime overheads due to blocking device-to-host transfers, data-oblivious serialization, and storage I/O contention. In this paper, we introduce DataStates-LLM, a novel checkpointing architecture that leverages State Providers to decouple state abstraction from data movement. DataStates-LLM exploits the immutability of model parameters during the forward and backward passes to perform ``lazy'', non-blocking asynchronous snapshots. By introducing State Providers, we efficiently coalesce fragmented, heterogeneous shards and overlap the serialization of metadata with bulk tensor I/O. We evaluate DataStates-LLM on models up to 70B parameters on 256 A100-40GB GPUs. Our results demonstrate that DataStates-LLM achieves up to 4$\\times$ higher checkpointing throughput and reduces end-to-end training time by up to 2.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions, effectively mitigating the serialization and heterogeneity bottlenecks in extreme-scale LLM training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DataStates-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u5feb\u7167\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u76843D\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataStates-LLM\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528State Providers\u89e3\u8026\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u963b\u585e\u5f02\u6b65\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u7247\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728256\u4e2aA100-40GB GPU\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd570B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDataStates-LLM\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53474\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c112.2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DataStates-LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165State Providers\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided.

These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option.

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7eb3\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\uff08perspective tokens\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\uff081\uff09\u4f53\u73b0\u8eab\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6216\uff082\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-1.5-13B\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\u540e\uff0c\u5728Level-2\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08Isle Bricks V2\u3001COCO\u30013DSRBench\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5c24\u5176\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u548c\u66f4\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}~cubes and a mug.

In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model.

While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VTFusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9FSAD\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4e14\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u4e3a\u6d45\u5c42\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "VTFusion\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u5f25\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5757\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "VTFusion\u57282-shot\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e8eMVTec AD\u548cVisA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f9796.8%\u548c86.2%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5851\u6599\u96f6\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.5%\u7684AUPRO\u3002", "conclusion": "VTFusion\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86FSAD\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728MVTec AD\u548cVisA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76842-shot\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696.8%\u548c86.2%\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5851\u6599\u96f6\u4ef6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.5%\u7684AUPRO\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications.

Beyond serving as code auto-completion tools in integrated development environments, large language models increasingly function as foundation models within coding agents in vibe-coding scenarios. In such settings, prompts play a central role in agent-based intelligent software development, as they not only guide the behavior of large language models but also serve as carriers of user requirements. Under the dominant conversational paradigm, prompts are typically divided into system prompts and user prompts. System prompts provide high-level instructions to steer model behavior and establish conversational context, while user prompts represent inputs and requirements provided by human users. Despite their importance, designing effective prompts remains challenging, as it requires expertise in both prompt engineering and software engineering, particularly requirements engineering. To reduce the burden of manual prompt construction, numerous automated prompt engineering methods have been proposed. However, most existing approaches neglect the methodological principles of requirements engineering, limiting their ability to generate artifacts that conform to formal requirement specifications in realistic software development scenarios. To address this gap, we propose REprompt, a multi-agent prompt optimization framework guided by requirements engineering.

However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets.

Since most code-specific LLMs are pretrained on well-commented code from large repositories like GitHub, it is reasonable to hypothesize that natural language code comments could aid in improving translation quality. Despite their potential relevance, comments are largely absent from existing code translation benchmarks, rendering their impact on translation quality inadequately characterised. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study evaluating the impact of comments on translation performance. Our analysis involves more than $80,000$ translations, with and without comments, of $1100+$ code samples from two distinct benchmarks covering pairwise translations between five different programming languages: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. Our results provide strong evidence that code comments, particularly those that describe the overall purpose of the code rather than line-by-line functionality, significantly enhance translation accuracy. Based on these findings, we propose COMMENTRA, a code translation approach, and demonstrate that it can potentially double the performance of LLM-based code translation.

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks.

Programming languages and execution models strongly influence software energy consumption, with interpreted languages generally being less efficient than compiled ones. Lua illustrates this trade-off: despite its popularity, it is less energy-efficient than greener and faster languages such as C.\n  This paper presents an empirical study of Lua's runtime performance and energy efficiency across 25 official interpreter versions and just-in-time (JIT) compilers. Using a comprehensive benchmark suite, we measure execution time and energy consumption to analyze Lua's evolution, the impact of JIT compilation, and comparisons with other languages. Results show that all LuaJIT compilers significantly outperform standard Lua interpreters. The most efficient LuaJIT consumes about seven times less energy and runs seven times faster than the best Lua interpreter.

Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback.

Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier.

However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise.

This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements.

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation.

While adoption rates in the industry are rising, the underlying factors influencing the effective use of these tools, including the depth of interaction, organizational constraints, and experience-related considerations, have not been thoroughly investigated. This issue is particularly relevant in environments with stringent regulatory requirements, such as Germany, where practitioners must address the GDPR and the EU AI Act while balancing productivity gains with intellectual property considerations. Despite the significant impact of GenAI on software engineering, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has systematically examined the adoption dynamics of GenAI tools within the German context. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive mixed-methods study on GenAI adoption among German software engineers. Specifically, we conducted 18 exploratory interviews with practitioners, followed by a developer survey with 109 participants. We analyze patterns of tool adoption, prompting strategies, and organizational factors that influence effectiveness. Our results indicate that experience level moderates the perceived benefits of GenAI tools, and productivity gains are not evenly distributed among developers. Further, organizational size affects both tool selection and the intensity of tool use. Limited awareness of the project context is identified as the most significant barrier.

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone.

In the age of service-orientation (a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS)) APIs have become core business assets and can easily expose hundreds of operations. While well-designed APIs contribute to the commercial success of a service, poorly designed APIs can threaten entire organizations. Recognizing their relevance and value, many guidelines have been proposed for designing usable APIs, similar to design patterns and coding standards. For example, Zalando and Microsoft provide popular REST API guidelines. However, they are often considered as too large and inapplicable, so many companies create and maintain their own guidelines, which is a challenge in itself. In practice, however, developers still struggle to design effective REST APIs. To improve the situation, we need to improve our empirical understanding of adopting, using, and creating REST API guidelines.\n  We present an interview study with 16 REST API experts from industry. We determine the notion of API usability, guideline effectiveness factors, challenges of adopting and designing guidelines, and best practices. We identified eight factors influencing REST API usability, among which the adherence to conventions is the most important one. While guidelines can in fact be an effective means to improve API usability, there is significant resistance from developers against strict guidelines. Guideline size and how it fits with organizational needs are two important factors to consider. REST guidelines also have to grow with the organization, while all stakeholders need to be involved in their development and maintenance. Automated linting provides an opportunity to not only embed compliance enforcement into processes, but also to justify guideline rules with educational explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u63ed\u793a\u4e86REST API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6307\u5357\u9700\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u5951\u5408\u5e76\u6d89\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316linting\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "REST API\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u5546\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u5357\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684API\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8616\u4f4dREST API\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u6307\u5357\u6709\u6548\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u7684\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cdREST API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u60ef\u4f8b\u6700\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6307\u5357\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8API\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u4e25\u683c\u6307\u5357\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u62b5\u89e6\u3002", "conclusion": "REST API\u6307\u5357\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u3001\u6307\u5357\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316linting\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u6307\u5357\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning.

Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers \"selectively skim\" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., \"focus on error handling\") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities.

In configurable systems, compilation errors may arise only under specific combinations of features, remaining hidden during development and testing. Such variability-induced errors are difficult to detect in practice, as traditional compilers analyze only a single configuration at a time, while existing variability-aware tools typically require complex setup and incur high analysis costs. In this article, we present an empirical study on the use of foundation models to detect and fix compilation errors caused by feature variability in configurable C systems. We evaluate GPT-OSS-20B and GEMINI 3 PRO, and compare them with TYPECHEF, a state-of-the-art variability-aware parser. Our evaluation considers two complementary settings: 5,000 small configurable systems designed to systematically exercise variability-induced compilation behavior, comprising both systems with and without compilation errors, and 14 real-world GitHub commits, as well as an additional set of mutation testing scenarios (42). Our results show that foundation models can effectively identify variability-induced compilation errors. On small configurable systems, GPT-OSS-20B achieved a precision of 0.97, recall of 0.90, and accuracy of 0.94, substantially increasing detection coverage compared to TYPECHEF, and exhibiting performance comparable to GEMINI 3. For compilation error repair, GPT-OSS-20B produced compilable fixes in over 70% of the cases. In the analysis of real commits, CHATGPT-5.2 detected all injected faults except for two cases and identified a potential real compilation bug in a Linux commit with more than 1,000 modified lines. Our findings indicate that current state-of-the-art foundation models provide a practical and low-effort complement to traditional variability-aware analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u7531\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u8bd1\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9009\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-OSS-20B\u548cGEMINI 3 PRO\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTYPECHEF\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5305\u62ec5,000\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c14\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684GitHub\u63d0\u4ea4\u3002", "result": "GPT-OSS-20B\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe0.97\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u73870.90\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73870.94\uff1b\u4fee\u590d\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8570%\u3002\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\uff0cCHATGPT-5.2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9664\u4e24\u4f8b\u5916\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u5165\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7f16\u8bd1\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002"}}

This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions.

Contrary to the disposable code narrative, agent-authored code survives significantly longer: at the line level, it exhibits a 15.8 percentage-point lower modification rate and 16% lower hazard of modification (HR = 0.842, p < 0.001). However, modification profiles differ. Agent-authored code shows modestly elevated corrective rates (26.3% vs. 23.0%), while human code shows higher adaptive rates. However, the effect sizes are small (Cram\u00e9r's V = 0.116), and per-agent variation exceeds the agent-human gap. Turning to prediction, textual features can identify modification-prone code (AUC-ROC = 0.671), but predicting when modifications occur remains challenging (Macro F1 = 0.285), suggesting timing depends on external organizational dynamics. The bottleneck for agent-generated code may not be generation quality, but the organizational practices that govern its long-term evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6301\u4e45\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5426\u5982\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u90a3\u6837\u662f\u2018\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u2019\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ef4\u62a4\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9201\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc720\u4e07\u4ee3\u7801\u5355\u5143\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u884c\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u4fee\u6539\u7387\u4f4e15.8%\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u98ce\u9669\u4f4e16%\uff0c\u4f46\u7ea0\u6b63\u7387\u7565\u9ad8\uff0826.3% vs. 23.0%\uff09\u3002\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6613\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\uff08AUC-ROC = 0.671\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\uff08Macro F1 = 0.285\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u975e\u2018\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u2019\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u957f\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eAI\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b9e\u8df5\u800c\u975e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external \"Domain Expert\" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters.

We identified 364 maintainability and security-related build smells across varying severity levels, indicating that AI-generated build code can introduce quality issues-such as lack of error handling, and hardcoded paths or URLs-while also, in some cases, removing existing smells through refactorings (e.g., Pull Up Module and Externalize Properties).

Our framework integrates into an industrial game testing pipeline, enabling developers to receive immediate coverage feedback on tests run against their changes. The compilation overhead of our approach is minimal, allowing instrumentation of over 2,000 commits before doubling build time.

Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360\u00b0 scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner.

Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency.

However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity.

However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones.

This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4eceCSAS\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5b54\u5f84\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548cFFSE\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u96d5\u523b\u5b9e\u73b03D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CSAS\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u9634\u5f71\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4eceCSAS\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6790\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b50\u5b54\u5f84\u6ee4\u6ce2\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e94\u7528FFSE\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u9634\u5f71\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u96d5\u523b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u5728CSAS\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6790\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5b54\u5f84\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7126\u70b9\u9634\u5f71\u589e\u5f3a\uff08FFSE\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4eceCSAS\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e863DGS\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51faAdamW-GS\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758fAdam\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u57283DGS\u548c3DGS-MCMC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdamW-GS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8026\u5408\u6709\u76ca\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets.

Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows.

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay.

In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CPM\u548cCMMD\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u9886\u57df\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM)\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD)\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Fundus\u548cM&Ms\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7CPM\u548cCMMD\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information.
