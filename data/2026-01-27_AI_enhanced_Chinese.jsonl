While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced FVV due to its superior rendering speed, Streaming Free-Viewpoint Video (SFVV) introduces additional demands for rapid optimization, high-fidelity reconstruction under sparse constraints, and minimal storage footprints. To bridge this gap, we propose StreamLoD-GS, an LoD-based Gaussian Splatting framework designed specifically for SFVV. Our approach integrates three core innovations: 1) an Anchor- and Octree-based LoD-structured 3DGS with a hierarchical Gaussian dropout technique to ensure efficient and stable optimization while maintaining high-quality rendering; 2) a GMM-based motion partitioning mechanism that separates dynamic and static content, refining dynamic regions while preserving background stability; and 3) a quantized residual refinement framework that significantly reduces storage requirements without compromising visual fidelity.

We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity.

However, generative modeling of B-Reps remains a formidable challenge due to their inherent heterogeneity as geometric cell complexes, which entangles topology with geometry across cells of varying orders (i.e., $k$-cells such as vertices, edges, faces). Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries. By decoupling the rigid hierarchy, our representation unifies vertices, edges, and faces, enabling the joint generation of topology and geometry with global context awareness.\n  We synthesize these particle sets using a multi-modal flow matching framework to handle unconditional generation as well as precise conditional tasks, such as 3D reconstruction from single-view or point cloud. Furthermore, the explicit and localized nature of our representation naturally extends to downstream tasks like local in-painting and enables the direct synthesis of non-manifold structures (e.g., wireframes).

We develop two parallel approaches: a hierarchical merging variant of the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm, and a novel parallel push-relabel algorithm with level synchronized global relabeling. Our primary contribution is the push-relabel variant, which partitions the graph into segments along columns with processor affinity, eliminating the need for a global shared queue.

However, it cannot handle non-linearly separable clusters. Kernel K-means addresses this limitation but requires a large kernel matrix, making it computationally and memory intensive. Prior work has accelerated Kernel K-means by formulating it using sparse linear algebra primitives and implementing it on a single GPU. However, that approach cannot run on datasets with more than approximately 80,000 samples due to limited GPU memory.\n  In this work, we address this issue by presenting a suite of distributed-memory parallel algorithms for large-scale Kernel K-means clustering on multi-GPU systems. Our approach maps the most computationally expensive components of Kernel K-means onto communication-efficient distributed linear algebra primitives uniquely tailored for Kernel K-means, enabling highly scalable implementations that efficiently cluster million-scale datasets. Central to our work is the design of partitioning schemes that enable communication-efficient composition of the linear algebra primitives that appear in Kernel K-means.\n  Our 1.5D algorithm consistently achieves the highest performance, enabling Kernel K-means to scale to data one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously practical. On 256 GPUs, it achieves a geometric mean weak scaling efficiency of $79.7\\%$ and a geometric mean strong scaling speedup of $4.2\\times$. Compared to our 1D algorithm, the 1.5D approach achieves up to a $3.6\\times$ speedup on 256 GPUs and reduces clustering time from over an hour to under two seconds relative to a single-GPU sliding window implementation. Our results show that distributed algorithms designed with application-specific linear algebraic formulations can achieve substantial performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591aGPU\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Kernel K-means\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Kernel K-means\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u56e0GPU\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591aGPU\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Kernel K-means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5206\u533a\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u539f\u8bed\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "1.5D\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728256\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8679.7%\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u5f31\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u548c4.2\u500d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd41D\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u901f3.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u516c\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c1.5D\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728256\u4e2aGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c06Kernel K-means\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u5927\u4e00\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ImgCoder\u6846\u67b6\u548cSciGenBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u903b\u8f91\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ImgCoder\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u201c\u7406\u89e3-\u89c4\u5212-\u7f16\u7801\u201d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165SciGenBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5fae\u8c03LMMs\u5728\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented.

Despite progress in automated pattern generation, accurately modeling sewing patterns remains difficult due to the broad variability in panel geometry and seam arrangements. In this work, we introduce a sewing pattern modeling method based on an implicit representation. We represent each panel using a signed distance field that defines its boundary and an unsigned distance field that identifies seam endpoints, and encode these fields into a continuous latent space that enables differentiable meshing. A latent flow matching model learns distributions over panel combinations in this representation, and a stitching prediction module recovers seam relations from extracted edge segments. This formulation allows accurate modeling and generation of sewing patterns with complex structures. We further show that it can be used to estimate sewing patterns from images with improved accuracy relative to existing approaches, and supports applications such as pattern completion and refitting, providing a practical tool for digital fashion design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9762\u677f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u63a5\u7f1d\u6392\u5217\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5236\u4f5c\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9762\u677f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u548c\u6807\u8bc6\u63a5\u7f1d\u7aef\u70b9\u7684\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u677f\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f1d\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6bb5\u6062\u590d\u63a5\u7f1d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u6848\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u9002\u914d\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While this is a classical problem with a significant body of research on approximation algorithms over the past two decades, constant-factor performance guarantees are currently known only under very restrictive assumptions on the input distributions, even when all job weights are identical. This algorithmic difficulty is striking given the lack of corresponding complexity results: to date, it is conceivable that the problem could be solved optimally in polynomial time.\n  We address this gap with hardness results that demonstrate the problem's inherent intractability. For the special case of discrete two-point processing time distributions and unit weights, we prove that deciding whether there exists a scheduling policy with expected cost at most a given threshold is #P-hard. Furthermore, we show that evaluating the expected objective value of the standard (W)SEPT greedy policy is itself #P-hard. These represent the first hardness results for scheduling independent stochastic jobs and min-sum objective that do not merely rely on the intractability of the underlying deterministic counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ecd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u4e24\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5355\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u7684#P-\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u4e24\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5355\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u662f#P-\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6(W)SEPT\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u671f\u671b\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u4e5f\u662f#P-\u96be\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u8c03\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u4f5c\u4e1a\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u96be\u5904\u7406\u6027\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u4e24\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5355\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u7684#P-\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper examines the feasibility of push down optimization in multi cloud ETL pipelines and analyzes its benefits and limitations.

Existing taint analysis tools are predominantly designed for single languages, requiring substantial engineering effort that scales with language diversity. While multi-language tools like CodeQL, Joern, and WALA attempt to address these challenges, they face limitations in intermediate representation design, analysis precision, and extensibility, which make them difficult to scale effectively for large-scale industrial applications at Ant Group. To bridge this gap, we present YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer), a unified multi-language static taint analysis framework designed for industrial-scale deployment. Specifically, YASA introduces the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) that provides a unified abstraction for compatibility across diverse programming languages. Building on the UAST, YASA performs point-to analysis and taint propagation, leveraging a unified semantic model to manage language-agnostic constructs, while incorporating language-specific semantic models to handle other unique language features. When compared to 6 single- and 2 multi-language static analyzers on an industry-standard benchmark, YASA consistently outperformed all baselines across Java, JavaScript, Python, and Go. In real-world deployment within Ant Group, YASA analyzed over 100 million lines of code across 7.3K internal applications.

Although the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture provides open interfaces and an intelligent control plane, it leaves the life-cycle management of these models unspecified. Consequently, operators still rely on ad-hoc, manual update practices that can neither scale across the heterogeneous, multi-layer stack of Cell-Site, Edge-, Regional-, and Central-Cloud domains, nor across the three O-RAN control loops (real-, near-real-, and non-real-time). We present a self-learning framework that provides an efficient closed-loop version management for an AI-native O-RAN edge. In this framework, training pipelines in the Central/Regional Cloud continuously generate new models, which are cataloged along with their resource footprints, security scores, and accuracy metrics in a shared version repository. An Update Manager consults this repository and applies a self-learning policy to decide when and where each new model version should be promoted into operation. A container orchestrator then realizes these decisions across heterogeneous worker nodes, enabling multiple services (rApps, xApps, and dApps) to obtain improved inference with minimal disruption. Simulation results show that an efficient RL-driven decision-making can guarantee quality of service, bounded latencies while balancing model accuracy, system stability, and resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eAI\u539f\u751fO-RAN\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u95ed\u73af\u7248\u672c\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7684AI\u539f\u751f\u613f\u666f\u8981\u6c42\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1O-RAN\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u592e/\u533a\u57df\u4e91\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\u5360\u7528\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e00\u8d77\u7f16\u76ee\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7248\u672c\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002\u66f4\u65b0\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e94\u7528\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u4f55\u5730\u63a8\u5e7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7248\u672c\u3002\u5bb9\u5668\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u968f\u540e\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5de5\u4f5c\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9650\u5236\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u3002"}}

While robotic automation offers solutions, construction robots struggle to adapt to unstructured, dynamic sites. Central to this is improvisation, adapting to unexpected situations through creative problem-solving, which remains predominantly human. In construction's unpredictable environments, collaborative human-robot improvisation is essential for workflow continuity. This research develops a six-level taxonomy classifying human-robot collaboration (HRC) based on improvisation capabilities. Through systematic review of 214 articles (2010-2025), we categorize construction robotics across: Manual Work (Level 0), Human-Controlled Execution (Level 1), Adaptive Manipulation (Level 2), Imitation Learning (Level 3), Human-in-Loop BIM Workflow (Level 4), Cloud-Based Knowledge Integration (Level 5), and True Collaborative Improvisation (Level 6). Analysis reveals current research concentrates at lower levels, with critical gaps in experiential learning and limited progression toward collaborative improvisation. A five-dimensional radar framework illustrates progressive evolution of Planning, Cognitive Role, Physical Execution, Learning Capability, and Improvisation, demonstrating how complementary human-robot capabilities create team performance exceeding individual contributions. The research identifies three fundamental barriers: technical limitations in grounding and dialogic reasoning, conceptual gaps between human improvisation and robotics research, and methodological challenges. We recommend future research emphasizing improved human-robot communication via Augmented/Virtual Reality interfaces, large language model integration, and cloud-based knowledge systems to advance toward true collaborative improvisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5373\u5174\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u5f3a\u6c9f\u901a\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u884c\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u505c\u6ede\u3001\u719f\u7ec3\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u77ed\u7f3a\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5de5\u5730\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5373\u5174\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u7ef4\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0214\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\uff082010-2025\u5e74\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516d\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e94\u7ef4\u96f7\u8fbe\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u5373\u5174\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4e94\u7ef4\u96f7\u8fbe\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u516d\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u52a0\u5f3a\u4eba\u673a\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u5229\u7528AR/VR\u754c\u9762\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5373\u5174\u3002"}}

Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology.

These systems differ fundamentally from traditional machine learning models, both in architecture and deployment, introducing unique AI safety challenges, including goal misalignment, compounding decision errors, and coordination risks among interacting agents, that necessitate embedding interpretability and explainability by design to ensure traceability and accountability across their autonomous behaviors. Current interpretability techniques, developed primarily for static models, show limitations when applied to agentic systems. The temporal dynamics, compounding decisions, and context-dependent behaviors of agentic systems demand new analytical approaches. This paper assesses the suitability and limitations of existing interpretability methods in the context of agentic systems, identifying gaps in their capacity to provide meaningful insight into agent decision-making. We propose future directions for developing interpretability techniques specifically designed for agentic systems, pinpointing where interpretability is required to embed oversight mechanisms across the agent lifecycle from goal formation, through environmental interaction, to outcome evaluation.

This limitation renders the S2V task reducible to an S2I + I2V pipeline, failing to exploit the full potential of video subject control. In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning. Our framework achieves superior 3D subject consistency w.r.t. multi-view reference images and high-quality visual outputs, establishing a new meaningful direction for subject-driven video generation.

Previously, a Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\u0398(n)$ was proposed for the capacitated VRP (CVRP) that finds the most cost-efficient partition of customers, given a long tour. This was an improvement over the previously fastest-known Split algorithm with a worst-case runtime of $\u0398(n^2)$ that was based on Bellman's shortest path algorithm. While this linear Split has been an integral part of modern state-of-the-art CVRP approaches, little progress has been made in extending this algorithm to handle additional VRP variants, limiting the general applicability of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an extension of the linear Split that handles two cardinal VRP variants simultaneously: (i) simultaneous pickups and deliveries (VRPSPD) and (ii) time windows (VRPTW). The resulting $\u0398(n)$ algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal, assuming travel times between nodes satisfy the triangle inequality. Additionally, we extend the linear Split to handle a capacity penalty for the VRPSPD. For the VRPTW, we extend the linear Split to handle the CVRP capacity penalty in conjunction with the popular time warp penalty function. Computational experiments are performed to empirically validate the speed gains of these linear Splits against their $\u0398$($n^2$) counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027Split\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406VRPSPD\u548cVRPTW\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ebf\u6027Split\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728CVRP\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6VRP\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u7ebf\u6027Split\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406VRPSPD\u548cVRPTW\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bb9\u91cf\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684\u7ebf\u6027Split\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ebf\u6027Split\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728VRPSPD\u548cVRPTW\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

By leveraging R's native pipe operator, users can parallelize existing code with minimal refactoring -- often by simply appending `|> futurize()' to an expression. The package supports classical map-reduce functions from base R, purrr, crossmap, foreach, plyr, BiocParallel, e.g., lapply(xs, fcn) |> futurize() and map(xs, fcn) |> futurize(), as well as a growing set of domain-specific packages, e.g., boot, caret, glmnet, lme4, mgcv, and tm.

While Age of Information (AoI) quantifies temporal freshness, Version Age of Information (VAoI) captures semantic staleness by accounting for version evolution between transmitters and receivers. Existing VAoI scheduling approaches primarily focus on minimizing average VAoI, overlooking rare but severe staleness events that can compromise reliability under stochastic packet arrivals and unreliable channels. This paper investigates both average-oriented and tail-risk-sensitive VAoI scheduling in a multi-user status update system with long-term transmission cost constraints. We first formulate the average VAoI minimization problem as a constrained Markov decision process and introduce a deep diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC) algorithm. By generating actions through a diffusion-based denoising process, D2SAC enhances policy expressiveness and establishes a strong baseline for mean performance. Building on this foundation, we put forth RS-D3SAC, a risk-sensitive deep distributional diffusion-based Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. RS-D3SAC integrates a diffusion-based actor with a quantile-based distributional critic, explicitly modeling the full VAoI return distribution. This enables principled tail-risk optimization via Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) while satisfying long-term transmission cost constraints. Extensive simulations show that, while D2SAC reduces average VAoI, RS-D3SAC consistently achieves substantial reductions in CVaR without sacrificing mean performance. The dominant gain in tail-risk reduction stems from the distributional critic, with the diffusion-based actor providing complementary refinement to stabilize and enrich policy decisions, highlighting their effectiveness for robust and risk-aware VAoI scheduling in multi-user wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u7528\u6237\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7684VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86D2SAC\u548cRS-D3SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u578b\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u548c\u6269\u6563\u578b\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u5747VAoI\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9648\u65e7\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5230\u8fbe\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5e73\u5747VAoI\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\u7684Soft Actor-Critic\uff08D2SAC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RS-D3SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u578b\u884c\u52a8\u8005\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u578b\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684VAoI\u56de\u62a5\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cD2SAC\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5e73\u5747VAoI\uff0c\u800cRS-D3SAC\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86CVaR\u7684\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RS-D3SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u671f\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86CVaR\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684VAoI\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures.

Symbolic systems offer reliability and interpretability but lack scalability, while neural networks provide learning capabilities but sacrifice transparency. Tensor Logic, proposed by Domingos, suggests that logical rules and Einstein summation are mathematically equivalent, offering a principled path toward unification. This paper provides empirical validation of this framework through three experiments. First, we demonstrate the equivalence between recursive Datalog rules and iterative tensor contractions by computing the transitive closure of a biblical genealogy graph containing 1,972 individuals and 1,727 parent-child relationships, converging in 74 iterations to discover 33,945 ancestor relationships. Second, we implement reasoning in embedding space by training a neural network with learnable transformation matrices, demonstrating successful zero-shot compositional inference on held-out queries. Third, we validate the Tensor Logic superposition construction on FB15k-237, a large-scale knowledge graph with 14,541 entities and 237 relations. Using Domingos's relation matrix formulation $R_r = E^\\top A_r E$, we achieve MRR of 0.3068 on standard link prediction and MRR of 0.3346 on a compositional reasoning benchmark where direct edges are removed during training, demonstrating that matrix composition enables multi-hop inference without direct training examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tensor Logic \u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1 Tensor Logic \u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u9012\u5f52 Datalog \u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5f20\u91cf\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b2) \u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b3) \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u77e9\u9635\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTensor Logic \u5728\u7956\u5148\u5173\u7cfb\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Tensor Logic \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation strategies such as per-frame latent variables or affine color corrections lack physical grounding and generalize poorly to novel views. We propose the Physically-Plausible ISP (PPISP) correction module, which disentangles camera-intrinsic and capture-dependent effects through physically based and interpretable transformations. A dedicated PPISP controller, trained on the input views, predicts ISP parameters for novel viewpoints, analogous to auto exposure and auto white balance in real cameras. This design enables realistic and fair evaluation on novel views without access to ground-truth images.

We analyze 8,031 agentic pull requests (PRs) from 1,605 GitHub repositories where AI agents touch YAML configurations. CI/CD configuration files account for 3.25% of agent changes, varying by agent (Devin: 4.83%, Codex: 2.01%, p < 0.001). When agents modify CI/CD, 96.77% target GitHub Actions. Agentic PRs with CI/CD changes merge slightly less often than others (67.77% vs. 71.80%), except for Copilot, whose CI/CD changes merge 15.63 percentage points more often.

In this paper, we consider the problem of reliable over-the-air broadcast of updates in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). Existing broadcast techniques for LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints. We address this problem by proposing a device-level cooperative mechanism, in which updated EDs broadcast a few update fragments to accelerate delivery to their neighbors. We demonstrate large reductions in the delivery time compared to conventional methods. For instance, in a 400-node network spanning 1 km radius and operating at 1% duty-cycle, the proposed scheme reduces the time required to deliver a 10 kilobyte update to an ED at the network's edge from 42 hours to 45 minutes. The proposed solution thus provides a pathway toward improved security and efficient realization of edge intelligence in LoRaWAN IoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a cooperative broadcast method for LoRaWANs, cutting update delivery time from 42h to 45min for 10KB updates.", "motivation": "Existing broadcast techniques in LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints.", "method": "A device-level cooperative mechanism where updated end devices broadcast update fragments to neighbors.", "result": "The scheme reduces delivery time from 42 hours to 45 minutes for a 10KB update in a 400-node network.", "conclusion": "The proposed cooperative mechanism significantly reduces update delivery time in LoRaWANs, enhancing security and edge intelligence efficiency."}}

Sampling-based approaches for Model Predictive Control, especially approaches based on the Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) algorithm, have recently proven both to be highly effective for such applications and to map naturally to GPUs for hardware acceleration. However, both GPU and CPU implementations of such algorithms can struggle to meet tight energy and latency budgets on battery-constrained AMR platforms that leverage embedded compute. To address this issue, we present an FPGA-optimized MPPI design that exposes fine-grained parallelism and eliminates synchronization bottlenecks via deep pipelining and parallelism across algorithmic stages. This results in an average 3.1x to 7.5x speedup over optimized implementations on an embedded GPU and CPU, respectively, while simultaneously achieving a 2.5x to 5.4x reduction in energy usage.

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks.

However, empirical evidence shows that many of these systems suffer from fundamental reliability issues, including hallucinated actions, unexecutable plans and brittle coordination. Crucially, these failures do not stem from limitations of the underlying models themselves, but from the absence of explicit architectural structure linking goals, capabilities and execution. This paper presents a declarative, model-independent architectural layer for grounded agentic workflows that addresses this gap. The proposed layer, referred to as DALIA (Declarative Agentic Layer for Intelligent Agents), formalises executable capabilities, exposes tasks through a declarative discovery protocol, maintains a federated directory of agents and their execution resources, and constructs deterministic task graphs grounded exclusively in declared operations. By enforcing a clear separation between discovery, planning and execution, the architecture constrains agent behaviour to a verifiable operational space, reducing reliance on speculative reasoning and free-form coordination. We present the architecture and design principles of the proposed layer and illustrate its operation through a representative task-oriented scenario, demonstrating how declarative grounding enables reproducible and verifiable agentic workflows across heterogeneous environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "DALIA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5c42DALIA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u76ee\u5f55\u53ca\u6784\u5efa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "DALIA\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "DALIA\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u660e\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Fraire", "Sandra Cespedes"], "title": "Contact Plan Design For Optical Interplanetary Communications", "comment": null, "summary": "Space exploration missions generate rapidly increasing volumes of scientific telemetry that far exceed the capacity of today's manually scheduled, RF-based deep-space infrastructure. Free-space optical (FSO) communications promise orders of magnitude higher throughput, but their narrow beams require precise pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) for link establishment and tightly synchronized contact schedules. Critically, no existing contact plan design (CPD) framework accounts for optical head retargeting delay, the time spent during coarse pointing and link acquisition before data transmission begins, which directly reduces usable contact time. Retargeting delay is the dominant impairment unique to optical networks, which induces a seconds-to-minutes-long mechanical pointing process for an optical terminal's laser from its current partner to the next receiver. This paper introduces the first PAT-aware CPD framework for optical interplanetary backhaul networks. The model captures directional temporal flows across both direct-to-Earth optical links and two-hop relay paths using delay/disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) satellites. We also introduce an optical network duty-cycle metric that quantifies the proportion of time spent transmitting to the contact window duration, exposing capacity lost to retargeting delay. Our results show that our MILP scheduler delivers over 30 percent higher network capacity than a greedy algorithm. More importantly, the results uncover a fundamental behavioral shift: when retargeting delays are modeled accurately, optimal schedules favor fewer but longer optical links that maximize throughput while minimizing retargeting overhead. These findings demonstrate that zero-delay assumptions substantially overestimate achievable performance and yield unrealistic contact plans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2aPAT\u611f\u77e5\u7684CPD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66\u661f\u9645\u56de\u7a0b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMILP\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u534730%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684RF\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u5b66\uff08FSO\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7a84\u6ce2\u675f\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5411\u3001\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08PAT\uff09\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a5\u89e6\u8ba1\u5212\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08CPD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u8003\u8651\u5149\u5b66\u5934\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5149\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6709\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9996\u4e2aPAT\u611f\u77e5\u7684CPD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b66\u661f\u9645\u56de\u7a0b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5730\u5149\u5b66\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u4e24\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9a\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf/\u4e2d\u65ad\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DTN\uff09\u536b\u661f\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMILP\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8fc730%\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u5c11\u4f46\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u96f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5047\u8bbe\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE-EMBC 2026", "summary": "Soft robotic suits have the potential to rehabilitate, assist, and augment the human body. The low weight, cost, and minimal form-factor of these devices make them ideal for daily use by both healthy and impaired individuals. However, challenges associated with data-driven, user-specific, and comfort-first design of human-robot interfaces using soft materials limit their widespread translation and adoption. In this work, we present the quantitative evaluation of ergonomics and comfort of the Elevate suit - a cable driven soft robotic suit that assists shoulder elevation. Using a motion-capture system and force sensors, we measured the suit's ergonomics during assisted shoulder elevation up to 70 degrees.

We develop a minimal and calibratable theory that predicts these regimes from three binding constraints of modern agent stacks: finite context windows, lossy inter-agent communication, and shared failures among similar agents. Each leaf agent is summarized by a compute-performance scaling exponent $\u03b2$; communication is captured by a message-length fidelity curve $\u03b3(m)$; dependence is captured by an effective shared-error correlation $\u03c1$; and a context window $W$ imposes hard fan-in limits that make hierarchy necessary. For binary success/failure tasks with majority aggregation, we prove a sharp phase transition for deep $b$-ary trees with correlated inputs and lossy communication: a single scalar $\u03b1_\u03c1$ (combining $\u03b3(m)$, $\u03c1$, and fan-in $b$) determines whether weak signal is amplified to a nontrivial fixed point or washed out to chance. In the amplifying regime, we derive an organization exponent $s$ and show that budgeted synergy, i.e., outperforming the best single agent under the same total budget, occurs exactly when $s>\u03b2$, yielding closed-form compute allocation rules and explicit budget thresholds. We further characterize saturation via a mixing depth and provide a conservative clipped predictor that remains accurate across growth and saturation. A continuous-performance warm-up gives closed-form risks for star, chain, and tree organizations, making correlation- and communication-induced floors explicit and exposing the core design trade-offs in a smooth setting. Finally, we validate the predicted phase boundaries in controlled synthetic simulations and show how the same mechanisms explain the dominant bottlenecks reported in recent large-scale matched-budget studies of LLM agent-system scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u3001\u9971\u548c\u6216\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u3001\u6709\u635f\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u6307\u6570\u03b2\u3001\u6d88\u606f\u957f\u5ea6\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u03b3(m)\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u03c1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3W\u6765\u5206\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u653e\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6307\u6570s\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u7b97\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e14\u53ef\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

Although prior work has proposed an efficient CPU-based serial method for counting balanced (2, k)-bicliques. The computational cost of balanced butterfly counting remains a major bottleneck on large-scale graphs. In this work, we present the highly parallel implementations for balanced butterfly counting for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. The proposed multi-core algorithm (M-BBC) employs fine-grained vertex-level parallelism to accelerate wedge-based counting while eliminating the generation of unbalanced substructures. To improve scalability, we develop a GPU-based method (G-BBC) that uses a tile-based parallel approach to effectively leverage shared memory while handling large vertex sets. We then present an improved variation, G-BBC++, which integrates dynamic scheduling to mitigate workload imbalance and maximize throughput. We conduct an experimental assessment of the proposed methods across 15 real-world datasets. Experimental results exhibit that M-BBC achieves speedups of up to 71.13x (average 38.13x) over the sequential baseline BB2K. The GPU-based algorithms deliver even greater improvements, achieving up to 13,320x speedup (average 2,600x) over BB2K and outperforming M-BBC by up to 186x (average 50x).

Many existing methods oversimplify the rich dynamics of deformable objects or require large training sets, which often limits generalization. We introduce embodied MPM (EMPM), a deformable object modeling and simulation framework built on a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator that captures the dynamics of challenging materials. From multi-view RGB-D videos, our approach reconstructs geometry and appearance, then uses an MPM physics engine to simulate object behavior by minimizing the mismatch between predicted and observed visual data. We further optimize MPM parameters online using sensory feedback, enabling adaptive, robust, and physics-aware object representations that open new possibilities for robotic manipulation of complex deformables. Experiments show that EMPM outperforms spring-mass baseline models.

To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries.

Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.\n  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code.

While parsers prioritize semantic accuracy (i.e., event identification), they often obscure deep correlations between static templates and dynamic variables that are critical for storage efficiency. In this paper, we investigate this misalignment through a comprehensive empirical study and propose LogPrism, a framework that bridges the gap via unified redundancy encoding. Rather than relying on a rigid pre-parsing step, LogPrism dynamically integrates structural extraction with variable encoding by constructing a Unified Redundancy Tree (URT). This hierarchical approach effectively mines \"structure+variable\" co-occurrence patterns, capturing deep contextual redundancies while accelerating processing through pre-emptive pattern encoding. Extensive experiments on 16 benchmark datasets confirm that LogPrism establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves the highest compression ratio on 13 datasets, surpassing leading baselines by margins of 4.7% to 80.9%, while delivering superior throughput at 29.87 MB/s (1.68$\\times$~43.04$\\times$ faster than competitors).

However, unlike conventional throughput maximization, Covert Communication (CC) requires optimizing transmission utility under strict detection-theoretic constraints, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence limits. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general reasoning or standard communication tasks and do not adequately evaluate the ability of LLMs to satisfy these rigorous security constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CovertComBench, a unified benchmark designed to assess LLM capabilities across the CC pipeline, encompassing conceptual understanding (MCQs), optimization derivation (ODQs), and code generation (CGQs). Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of automated scoring within a detection-theoretic ``LLM-as-Judge'' framework. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art models reveal a significant performance discrepancy. While LLMs achieve high accuracy in conceptual identification (81%) and code implementation (83%), their performance in the higher-order mathematical derivations necessary for security guarantees ranges between 18% and 55%.

To facilitate the further adoption and integration of humanoid robots into service roles, we present a real-time framework for NAO robots that synchronizes speech prosody with full-body gestures through three key innovations: (1) A dual-channel emotion engine where large language model (LLM) simultaneously generates context-aware text responses and biomechanically feasible motion descriptors, constrained by a structured joint movement library; (2) Duration-aware dynamic time warping for precise temporal alignment of speech output and kinematic motion keyframes; (3) Closed-loop feasibility verification ensuring gestures adhere to NAO's physical joint limits through real-time adaptation. Evaluations show 21% higher emotional alignment compared to rule-based systems, achieved by coordinating vocal pitch (arousal-driven) with upper-limb kinematics while maintaining lower-body stability. By enabling seamless sensorimotor coordination, this framework advances the deployment of context-aware social robots in dynamic applications such as personalized healthcare, interactive education, and responsive customer service platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NAO\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u8fdb\u5165\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u89d2\u8272\u4e2d\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(1) \u53cc\u901a\u9053\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b(2) \u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u6574\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(3) \u95ed\u73af\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u786e\u4fdd\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b26\u5408NAO\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5173\u8282\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621%\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u58f0\u8c03\uff08\u7531\u5174\u594b\u9a71\u52a8\uff09\u4e0e\u4e0a\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u534a\u8eab\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u3001\u4e92\u52a8\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5ba2\u670d\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We formalize AGI axiomatically as a distributional, resource-bounded semantic predicate, indexed by a task family, a task distribution, a performance functional, and explicit resource budgets. Under this framework, we derive four classes of results. First, we show that generality is inherently relational: there is no distribution-independent notion of AGI. Second, we prove non-invariance results demonstrating that arbitrarily small perturbations of the task distribution can invalidate AGI properties via cliff sets, precluding universal robustness. Third, we establish bounded transfer guarantees, ruling out unbounded generalization across task families under finite resources. Fourth, invoking Rice-style and G\u00f6del--Tarski arguments, we prove that AGI is a nontrivial semantic property and therefore cannot be soundly and completely certified by any computable procedure, including procedures implemented by the agent itself. Consequently, recursive self-improvement schemes that rely on internal self-certification of AGI are ill-posed.

This process rectifies the camera's oblique perspective, ensuring that pixel distances accurately represent real-world distances. This enables the acquisition of features such as vehicle trajectory, speed, deceleration, and braking severity without the need for camera calibration. The pipeline employs the MAGSAC++ estimator to build the homography, converting YOLO11 object detections into a rectified top-down coordinate system. All detection and trajectory data are stored in a ClickHouse database for subsequent analysis. A real-world case study at two signalized intersections in Key West, Florida, showcased the system's capabilities. Across two days of daytime footage, braking activity at the higher-volume intersection peaked around 4 PM at approximately 57.5 events per hour, while the second intersection peaked around 10 AM at roughly 15.5 events per hour. The spatial analysis revealed that most braking events initiated upstream, with mild and moderate braking mostly occurring 30 to 45+ meters away from the stop bar and severe braking distributed throughout, but particularly concentrated in lanes with higher interaction and merging activity. The findings highlight the significant potential of this centralized safety information system to support connected vehicles, facilitating proactive traffic management, crash mitigation, and data-driven roadway design and safety analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934 footage\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6821\u51c6\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4ea4\u901a\u6444\u50cf\u5934 footage\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u91c7\u7528MAGSAC++\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\u5355\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5c06YOLO11\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u5728ClickHouse\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5dde\u57fa\u97e6\u65af\u7279\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5316\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u767d\u5929 footage \u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u7684\u5236\u52a8\u6d3b\u52a8\u5728\u4e0b\u53484\u70b9\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff08\u7ea657.5\u6b21/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5728\u4e0a\u534810\u70b9\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff08\u7ea615.5\u6b21/\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u3002\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5236\u52a8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5728\u4e0a\u6e38\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u8f7b\u5ea6\u81f3\u4e2d\u5ea6\u5236\u52a8\u591a\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u505c\u8f66\u7ebf30\u81f345+\u7c73\u5904\uff0c\u800c\u4e25\u91cd\u5236\u52a8\u5219\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u5e7f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u6d3b\u52a8\u8f83\u591a\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u8054\u7f51\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u4e8b\u6545\u7f13\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9053\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

We first analyze the transmission erasure probability under different connectivity configurations, including only HAPS or LEO satellites, as well as hybrid architectures that integrate both aerial/spatial and terrestrial infrastructures. To make the analysis more realistic, we considered movement of LEO satellites regarding a fixed region, elevation angle between gateway and devices, and different fading models for terrestrial and non-terrestrial communication. We also analyze LR-FHSS (Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) random access uplink technology as a potential use case for IoT connectivity, showing the scalability impact of the scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that HAPS can effectively complement sparse terrestrial networks and improve the performance of satellite-based systems in specific scenarios. Furthermore, considering the deployment and operational costs, respectively, CAPEX and OPEX, the economic analysis reveals that although HAPS exhibits higher costs, these remain within a comparable order of magnitude to LEO and terrestrial deployments.

We present an eye-tracking-driven control framework, aimed at enabling individuals with severe physical disabilities to perform daily tasks independently. Our system uses task pictograms as fiducial markers combined with a feature matching approach that transmits data of the selected object to accomplish necessary task related measurements with an eye-in-hand configuration. This eye-tracking control does not require knowledge of the user's position in relation to the object. The framework correctly interpreted object and task selection in up to 97.9% of measurements.

However, existing recognition systems face significant challenges due to their reliance on single sensor approaches like Leap Motion or RGB cameras. These systems struggle with limitations such as inadequate tracking of complex hand orientations and imprecise recognition of 3D hand movements. This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%.

However, we find that existing specificity evaluation protocols are inadequate for this purpose. We systematically elaborated on the three fundamental issues it faces. Beyond the conceptual issues, we further empirically demonstrate that existing specificity metrics are weakly correlated with the strength of specificity regularizers. We also find that current metrics lack sufficient sensitivity, rendering them ineffective at distinguishing the specificity performance of different methods. Finally, we propose a constructive evaluation protocol. Under this protocol, the conflict between open-ended LLMs and the assumption of determined answers is eliminated, query-independent fluency biases are avoided, and the evaluation strictness can be smoothly adjusted within a near-continuous space. Experiments across various LLMs, datasets, and editing methods show that metrics derived from the proposed protocol are more sensitive to changes in the strength of specificity regularizers and exhibit strong correlation with them, enabling more fine-grained discrimination of different methods' knowledge preservation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u533a\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u534f\u8bae\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5f0fLLM\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b54\u6848\u5047\u8bbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u8c03\u6574\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e25\u683c\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Motivated by the emerging bottleneck in large language model (LLM) serving, we study a particularly stringent regime of load balancing that arises in barrier-synchronized, stateful systems: work cannot be freely migrated and progress is gated by the slowest participant at each step, so heterogeneity and temporal drift in workloads create persistent stragglers and substantial idle time. LLM serving under data-parallel decoding provides a prominent modern instance: in production traces, barrier-induced idle can exceed 40% of compute time per decode step. Here we develop a universal load-balancing principle, which admits a step-wise finite-horizon integer-optimization formulation and yields worst-case guarantees: across LLM decode models and a broader class of non-decreasing workload drift processes, it reduces long-run imbalance by a factor that grows with batch size and system scale. Extensive experiments corroborate the theory, showing substantial improvements in throughput and latency together with reductions in energy consumption. These results provide a general, theoretically grounded framework for load balancing, with immediate implications for sustainable LLM serving and broad relevance to other synchronization-gated resource-allocation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c4f\u969c\u540c\u6b65\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8d85\u8fc7\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u768440%\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u6709\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u89e3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u7c7b\u975e\u9012\u51cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6f02\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u6709\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u6574\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u89e3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u7c7b\u975e\u9012\u51cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6f02\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

While AoI-based random access is essential for next-generation applications such as the low-altitude economy and indoor service robots, existing strategies, ranging from rule-based protocols to learning-based methods, face critical challenges, including idealized model assumptions, slow convergence, and poor generalization. In this article, we propose Reflex-Core, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) agent-based framework for AoI-driven random access in heterogeneous networks. By devising an \"Observe-Reflect-Decide-Execute\" closed-loop mechanism, this framework integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable optimal, autonomous access control. Based on the Reflex-Core framework, we develop a Reflexive Multiple Access (RMA) protocol and a priority-based RMA variant for intelligent access control under different heterogeneous network settings. Experimental results demonstrate that in the investigated scenarios, the RMA protocol achieves up to a 14.9% reduction in average AoI compared with existing baselines, while the priority-based version improves the convergence rate by approximately 20%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reflex-Core\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684AoI\u9a71\u52a8\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0cRMA\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AoI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8bbf\u95ee\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u201c\u89c2\u5bdf-\u53cd\u601d-\u51b3\u7b56-\u6267\u884c\u201d\u95ed\u73af\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Reflex-Core\u6846\u67b6\u53caRMA\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "RMA\u534f\u8bae\u5e73\u5747AoI\u964d\u4f4e14.9%\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7248\u672c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea620%\u3002", "conclusion": "Reflex-Core\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u884d\u751f\u7684RMA\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AoI\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Instead of manually piloting the drone, the user simply describes the desired shot (e.g., \"orbit around me slowly from the right and reveal the background waterfall\"). Our system encodes the prompt along with an initial visual snapshot from the onboard camera, and a diffusion model samples plausible spatio-temporal motion plans that satisfy both the scene geometry and shot semantics. The generated flight trajectory is then executed autonomously by the UAV to record smooth, repeatable video clips that match the prompt. User evaluation using NASA-TLX showed a significantly lower overall workload with our interface (M = 21.6) compared to a traditional remote controller (M = 58.1), demonstrating a substantial reduction in perceived effort. Mental demand (M = 11.5 vs. 60.5) and frustration (M = 14.0 vs. 54.5) were also markedly lower for our system, confirming clear usability advantages in autonomous text-driven flight control.

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between \"membership matrix\" and \"subspace matrix U\" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the \"membership matrix\" and \"subspaces U\" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Extended version of work under submission", "summary": "Graphs are central to modeling relationships in scientific computing, data analysis, and AI/ML, but their growing scale can exceed the memory and compute capacity of single nodes, requiring distributed solutions. Existing distributed graph framework, however, face fundamental challenges: graph algorithms are latency-bound, suffer from irregular memory access, and often impose synchronization costs that limit scalability and efficiency. In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the NWGraph library integrated with the HPX runtime system. By leveraging HPX's asynchronous many-task model, our approach aims to reduce synchronization overhead, improve load balance, and provide a foundation for distributed graph analytics. We evaluate this approach using two representative algorithms: Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and (PageRank). Our initial results show that BFS achieves better performance than the distributed Boost Graph Library (BGL), while PageRank remains more challenging, with current implementation not yet outperforming BGL.

This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3LLMs\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5174\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u7eaf\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Claude Code, Opus 4.5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7107\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u5f81\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u7b49\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a7420\u884c\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u83dc\u5355\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u6811\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u63a7\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7a97\u53e3\u684c\u9762\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u67b6\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

COMETS introduces a novel range-interest protocol and distributed in-network decision process that aligns video quality across receiver groups while minimizing redundant transmissions. To achieve this, we develop a lightweight distributed optimization framework that guides per-hop quality adaptation without centralized control. Extensive emulation shows that COMETS consistently improves bandwidth utilization, fairness, and user-perceived quality of experience over DASH, MoQ, and ICN baselines, particularly under high concurrency.

We study disability aware descriptions for person centric images, where models often transition from evidence grounded factual description to interpretation shift including introduction of unsupported inferences beyond observable visual evidence. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a benchmark based on paired Neutral Prompts (NP) and Disability-Contextualised Prompts (DP) and evaluate 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs under a zero-shot setting across 9 disability categories. Our evaluation framework treats interpretive fidelity as core objective and combines standard text-based metrics capturing affective degradation through shifts in sentiment, social regard and response length with an LLM-as-judge protocol, validated by annotators with lived experience of disability. We find that introducing disability context consistently degrades interpretive fidelity, inducing interpretation shifts characterised by speculative inference, narrative elaboration, affective degradation and deficit oriented framing. These effects are further amplified along race and gender dimension.

Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool.

This paper presents the first mmWave full-duplex backscatter tag architecture, charting a genuinely low-cost path toward high-performance mmWave connectivity and localization for ISAC systems. The proposed tag operates at ranges beyond 45m on the uplink and beyond 200m on the downlink, delivering 20x the reach of state-of-the-art systems while being over 100x cheaper than existing mmWave backscatter platforms. Enabling this leap is a novel low-power regenerative amplifier that provides 30 dB of gain while consuming only 30 mW, paired with a regenerative rectifier that achieves state-of-the-art sensitivity down to -60 dBm. We integrate our circuits on a compact PCB and evaluate it across diverse uplink and downlink scenarios, where it achieves an downlink BER of $10^{-1}$ at 200 meters and a uplink BER of $10^{-2}$ at 45 meters, demonstrating resilient, high-quality communication even at extended ranges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u529f\u8017\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u6cdb\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u518d\u751f\u653e\u5927\u5668\u548c\u518d\u751f\u6574\u6d41\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b30 dB\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u4f4e\u81f3-60 dBm\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u7d27\u51d1PCB\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u7b7e\u572845\u7c73\u4e0a\u884c\u548c200\u7c73\u4e0b\u884c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620\u500d\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e100\u500d\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u4e0b\u884cBER 10^-1\uff0c\u4e0a\u884cBER 10^-2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u6807\u7b7e\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u3002"}}

However, most existing whole-body controllers lack exteroceptive awareness of the surrounding environment, rendering them insufficient for stable task execution in complex, unstructured scenarios.To address this challenge, we propose PILOT, a unified single-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for perceptive loco-manipulation, which synergizes perceptive locomotion and expansive whole-body control within a single policy. To enhance terrain awareness and ensure precise foot placement, we design a cross-modal context encoder that fuses prediction-based proprioceptive features with attention-based perceptive representations. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) policy architecture to coordinate diverse motor skills, facilitating better specialization across distinct motion patterns. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on the physical Unitree G1 humanoid robot validate the efficacy of our framework.

Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce \"Noisomics\", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy.

Preprint. Code: https://github.com/faramesh/faramesh-core", "summary": "Autonomous agent systems increasingly trigger real-world side effects: deploying infrastructure, modifying databases, moving money, and executing workflows. Yet most agent stacks provide no mandatory execution checkpoint where organizations can deterministically permit, deny, or defer an action before it changes reality. This paper introduces Faramesh, a protocol-agnostic execution control plane that enforces execution-time authorization for agent-driven actions via a non-bypassable Action Authorization Boundary (AAB). Faramesh canonicalizes agent intent into a Canonical Action Representation (CAR), evaluates actions deterministically against policy and state, and issues a decision artifact (PERMIT/DEFER/DENY) that executors must validate prior to execution. The system is designed to be framework- and model-agnostic, supports multi-agent and multi-tenant deployments, and remains independent of transport protocols (e.g., MCP).

We observe that APR-introduced symbols (functions and classes) are removed much sooner than those in HPRs (median time to removal 3 vs. 34 days) and are also removed more often (symbol churn 7.33% vs. 4.10%), reflecting a focus on other tasks like documentation and test updates.

This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead. Results demonstrate that semantic priors from VLMs effectively guide physics-based optimization for fast and reliable RF material estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5c04\u9891\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u7535\u78c1\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9006\u5411\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff08RT\uff09\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ITU-R\u6750\u6599\u8868\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9a\u91cf\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u5668/\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u6216\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5e03\u5c40\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862-4\u500d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c10-100\u500d\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, point cloud-based policies remain highly sensitive to sensor noise, pose perturbations, and occlusion-induced artifacts, which distort geometric structure and break the equivariance assumptions required for robust generalization. Existing equivariant approaches primarily encode symmetry constraints into neural architectures, but do not explicitly correct noise-induced geometric deviations or enforce equivariant consistency in learned representations. We introduce EquiForm, a noise-robust SE(3)-equivariant policy learning framework for point cloud-based manipulation. EquiForm formalizes how noise-induced geometric distortions lead to equivariance deviations in observation-to-action mappings, and introduces a geometric denoising module to restore consistent 3D structure under noisy or incomplete observations. In addition, we propose a contrastive equivariant alignment objective that enforces representation consistency under both rigid transformations and noise perturbations. Built upon these components, EquiForm forms a flexible policy learning pipeline that integrates noise-robust geometric reasoning with modern generative models. We evaluate EquiForm on 16 simulated tasks and 4 real-world manipulation tasks across diverse objects and scene layouts.

Traditional analysis using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) often requires labor-intensive, manual evaluation of feature geometry, limiting throughput and reproducibility. In this study, we propose SiMiC: Context-Aware Silicon Microstructure Characterization Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Field-Emission Tip Analysis. By leveraging deep learning, our approach efficiently extracts morphological features-such as size, shape, and apex curvature-from SEM images, significantly reducing human intervention while improving measurement consistency. A specialized dataset of silicon-based field-emitter tips was developed, and a customized CNN architecture incorporating attention mechanisms was trained for multi-class microstructure classification and dimensional prediction. Comparative analysis with classical image processing techniques demonstrates that SiMiC achieves high accuracy while maintaining interpretability. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for data-driven microstructure analysis directly linked to field-emission performance, opening avenues for correlating emitter geometry with emission behavior and guiding the design of optimized cold-cathode and SEM electron sources.

However, existing automated approaches remain insufficient. Traditional static analysis methods struggle to precisely capture contextual dependencies, especially when vulnerabilities span multiple functions or modules. Large language models (LLMs) often lack the ability to retrieve and exploit sufficient contextual information, resulting in incomplete reasoning and unreliable outcomes. Meanwhile, recurring vulnerabilities emerge repeatedly due to code reuse and shared logic, making historical vulnerability knowledge an indispensable foundation for effective vulnerability detection and repair. Nevertheless, prior approaches such as clone-based detection and patch porting, have not fully leveraged this knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MAVM, a multi-agent framework for end-to-end recurring vulnerability management. MAVM integrates five components, including a vulnerability knowledge base, detection, confirmation, repair, and validation, into a unified multi-agent pipeline. We construct a knowledge base from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, thereby addressing the underuse of historical knowledge in prior work and mitigating the lack of domain-specific expertise in LLMs. Furthermore, we design context-retrieval tools that allow agents to extract and reason over repository-level information, overcoming the contextual limitations of previous methods. Based on agents, MAVM effectively simulates real-world security workflows. To evaluate the performance of MAVM, we construct a dataset containing 78 real-world patch-porting cases (covering 114 function-level migrations). On this dataset, MAVM successfully detects and repairs 51 real vulnerabilities, outperforming baselines by 31.9%-45.2% in repair accuracy, which demonstrates its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAVM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u77e5\u8bc6\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "MAVM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u786e\u8ba4\u3001\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b78\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8865\u4e01\u79fb\u690d\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMAVM\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u4e8651\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa31.9%-45.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "MAVM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u6f0f\u6d1e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

The challenge aims to address the critical need for automated recognition of unusual behaviors in facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities using non-invasive pose estimation data. Participating teams were tasked with distinguishing between normal and unusual activities based on skeleton keypoints extracted from video recordings of simulated scenarios. The dataset reflects real-world imbalance and temporal irregularities in behavior, and the evaluation adopted a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) strategy to ensure subject-agnostic generalization. The challenge attracted broad participation from 40 teams applying diverse approaches ranging from classical machine learning to deep learning architectures.

The second layer adds a learning-based soft-signature scorer (iScoreGen) and selective inter-procedural backward analysis with memory inspection (iScoreRefine) to reduce false positives. The final output, p-IndirectCFG, annotates indirect edges with confidence scores, enabling downstream analyses to choose appropriate precision--recall trade-offs. Across SPEC CPU2006 and real-world binaries, iScoreGen reduces predicted targets by 19.2% on average while maintaining BPA-level recall (98.2%). Combined with iScoreRefine, the total reduction reaches 44.3% over BPA with 97.8% recall (a 0.4% drop). iResolveX supports both conservative, recall-preserving and F1-optimized configurations and outperforms state-of-the-art systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "iResolveX \u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u9759\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u5728\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u867d\u7136\u5168\u9762\u4f46\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "iResolveX \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u503c\u96c6\u5206\u6790\uff08BPA\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6f\u7b7e\u540d\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\uff08iScoreGen\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u67e5\uff08iScoreRefine\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 SPEC CPU2006 \u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0ciScoreGen \u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 19.2% \u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301 98.2% \u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408 iScoreRefine \u540e\uff0c\u603b\u51cf\u5c11\u7387\u8fbe\u5230 44.3%\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a 97.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "iResolveX \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4fdd\u5b88\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95f4\u63a5\u8c03\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Sanket"], "title": "AsterNav: Autonomous Aerial Robot Navigation In Darkness Using Passive Computation", "comment": "8 pages, 10 figures, Published in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters", "summary": "Autonomous aerial navigation in absolute darkness is crucial for post-disaster search and rescue operations, which often occur from disaster-zone power outages. Yet, due to resource constraints, tiny aerial robots, perfectly suited for these operations, are unable to navigate in the darkness to find survivors safely. In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\\text{TM}$ Nano.

We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials.

However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "SP-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6d17\u624b\u95f4\u3001\u66f4\u8863\u5ba4\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u63a7\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u6a21\u6001\u6355\u83b7\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u65ad\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "SP-VLM\u5728\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\u6291\u5236\u8eab\u4efd\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4eba\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "SP-VLM\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u6743\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u53c8\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5e38\u6001\u5316\u3002"}}

While deep neural networks have been successfully used for vision-based tasks, they inherently lack provable guarantees on the correctness of their output, which is crucial for safety-critical applications. We present a framework for designing certifiable neural networks (NNs) for perception-based pose estimation that integrates physics-driven modeling with learning-based estimation. The proposed framework begins by leveraging the known geometry of planar objects commonly found in the environment, such as traffic signs and runway markings, referred to as target objects. At its core, it introduces a geometric generative model (GGM), a neural-network-like model whose parameters are derived from the image formation process of a target object observed by a camera. Once designed, the GGM can be used to train NN-based pose estimators with certified guarantees in terms of their estimation errors. We first demonstrate this framework in uncluttered environments, where the target object is the only object present in the camera's field of view. We extend this using ideas from NN reachability analysis to design certified object NN that can detect the presence of the target object in cluttered environments. Subsequently, the framework consolidates the certified object detector with the certified pose estimator to design a multi-stage perception pipeline that generalizes the proposed approach to cluttered environments, while maintaining its certified guarantees. We evaluate the proposed framework using both synthetic and real images of various planar objects commonly encountered by autonomous vehicles. Using images captured by an event-based camera, we show that the trained encoder can effectively estimate the pose of a traffic sign in accordance with the certified bound provided by the framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u5e73\u9762\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u6807\u5fd7\u548c\u8dd1\u9053\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08GGM\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u81ea\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u76f8\u673a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002GGM\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers.

The standard trial-and-error approach to find feasible parameter configurations is highly inefficient because validating each configuration is expensive in terms of resources (physical and human labor) and the configuration space is very large. This paper combines the general principles of AI-driven adaptive experimental design with domain knowledge to address the challenging problem of discovering feasible configurations. The key idea is to build a surrogate model from past experiments to intelligently select a small batch of input configurations for validation in each iteration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we deploy it for Directed Energy Deposition process to print GRCop--42, a high-performance copper--chromium--niobium alloy developed by NASA for aerospace applications. Within three months, our approach yielded multiple defect-free outputs across a range of laser powers dramatically reducing time to result and resource expenditure compared to several months of manual experimentation by domain scientists with no success. By enabling high-quality GRCop--42 fabrication on readily available infrared laser platforms for the first time, we democratize access to this critical alloy, paving the way for cost-effective, decentralized production for aerospace applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528AI\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f18\u5316\u91d1\u5c5e\u5408\u91d1\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u5c5e\u5408\u91d1\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bd5\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u6210\u529f\u83b7\u5f97\u591a\u4e2a\u65e0\u7f3a\u9677\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5468\u671f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfGRCop-42\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u5236\u9020\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5206\u6563\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In realistic project-level repair scenarios, software repositories often span millions of tokens, far exceeding current LLM context limits. Consequently, models must first identify a small, relevant subset of code, making accurate FL essential for effective repair. We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%.

Conventional stiffness estimation methods, which neglect delay, suffer from temporal misalignment between force and position signals, leading to significant estimation errors as delays increase. To address this, we propose a robust, delay-compensated stiffness estimation framework by deriving an algebraic estimator based on quasi-static equilibrium that explicitly accounts for temporally aligning the expert's input with the novice's response. A Normalised Weighted Least Squares (NWLS) implementation is then introduced to robustly filter dynamic bias resulting from the algebraic derivation. Experiments using commercial rehabilitation robots (H-MAN) as the platform demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard estimator, maintaining consistent tracking accuracy under multiple introduced delays.

Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between measured covariate shift and recognition performance, highlighting the importance of controlled benchmarks and quantitative domain characterization for studying out-of-distribution generalization in egocentric video.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgo4OOD\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u7c7b\u5185\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\u3001\u957f\u5c3e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\u5728Argo1M\u548cEgo4OOD\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Ego4OOD\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u81ea\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike prior work limited to function-level tasks, TAM-Eval operates at the test file level, while maintaining access to full repository context during isolated evaluation, better reflecting real-world maintenance workflows. Our benchmark comprises 1,539 automatically extracted and validated scenarios from Python, Java, and Go projects. TAM-Eval supports system-agnostic evaluation of both raw LLMs and agentic workflows, using a reference-free protocol based on test suite pass rate, code coverage, and mutation testing. Empirical results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs have limited capabilities in realistic test maintenance processes and yield only marginal improvements in test effectiveness.

However, its effectiveness depends critically on the quality and diversity of training data. In this work, we show how classical geometric planners can be leveraged to generate synthetic trajectories that complement costly human demonstrations. We train Less is More (LiMo), a transformer-based visual navigation policy that predicts goal-conditioned SE(2) trajectories from a single RGB observation, and find that augmenting limited expert demonstrations with planner-generated supervision yields substantial performance gains. Through ablations and complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses, we characterize how dataset scale and diversity affect planning performance. We demonstrate real-robot deployment and argue that robust visual navigation is enabled not by simply collecting more demonstrations, but by strategically curating diverse, high-quality datasets. Our results suggest that scalable, embodiment-specific geometric supervision is a practical path toward data-efficient visual navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565LiMo\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u51e0\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7b56\u7565LiMo\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u6b21RGB\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6SE(2)\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u7b5b\u9009\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6536\u96c6\u66f4\u591a\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Traditionally, this process demands physical inspection, introducing delays due to range safety protocols and increasing the risk of human error. We present an end-to-end computer vision system for automated bullet hole detection and iteration-based tracking directly from images taken at the firing line. Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences. Additionally, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline that standardizes target orientation using ORB-based perspective correction, improving model accuracy. Our system achieves 97.0% mean average precision on bullet hole detection and 88.8% accuracy in assigning bullet holes to the correct firing iteration.

While existing benchmarks measure these extremes, they fail to evaluate Safe Completion: the model's ability to maximise helpfulness on dual-use or borderline queries by providing safe, high-level guidance without crossing into actionable harm. We introduce \\textbf{Health-ORSC-Bench}, the first large-scale benchmark designed to systematically measure \\textbf{Over-Refusal} and \\textbf{Safe Completion} quality in healthcare. Comprising 31,920 benign boundary prompts across seven health categories (e.g., self-harm, medical misinformation), our framework uses an automated pipeline with human validation to test models at varying levels of intent ambiguity. We evaluate 30 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5 and Claude-4, revealing a significant tension: safety-optimised models frequently refuse up to 80\\% of \"Hard\" benign prompts, while domain-specific models often sacrifice safety for utility. Our findings demonstrate that model family and size significantly influence calibration: larger frontier models (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-4) exhibit \"safety-pessimism\" and higher over-refusal than smaller or MoE-based counterparts (e.g., Qwen-3-Next), highlighting that current LLMs struggle to balance refusal and compliance. Health-ORSC-Bench provides a rigorous standard for calibrating the next generation of medical AI assistants toward nuanced, safe, and helpful completions.

Adoption of Coding Agents on GitHub", "comment": null, "summary": "In the first half of 2025, coding agents have emerged as a category of development tools that have very quickly transitioned to the practice. Unlike ''traditional'' code completion LLMs such as Copilot, agents like Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex operate with high degrees of autonomy, up to generating complete pull requests starting from a developer-provided task description. This new mode of operation is poised to change the landscape in an even larger way than code completion LLMs did, making the need to study their impact critical. Also, unlike traditional LLMs, coding agents tend to leave more explicit traces in software engineering artifacts, such as co-authoring commits or pull requests. We leverage these traces to present the first large-scale study (129,134 projects) of the adoption of coding agents on GitHub, finding an estimated adoption rate of 15.85%--22.60%, which is very high for a technology only a few months old--and increasing. We carry out an in-depth study of the adopters we identified, finding that adoption is broad: it spans the entire spectrum of project maturity; it includes established organizations; and it concerns diverse programming languages or project topics. At the commit level, we find that commits assisted by coding agents are larger than commits only authored by human developers, and have a large proportion of features and bug fixes.

The system uses a spiking neural network deployed on the neuromorphic processor AltAi to classify EMG patterns in real time while an eye-tracking headset and scene camera identify the object within the user's focus. In our prototype, the same EMG recognition model that was originally developed for a conventional GPU is deployed as a spiking network on AltAi, achieving comparable accuracy while operating in a sub-watt power regime, which enables a lightweight, wearable implementation. For six distinct functional gestures recorded from upper-limb amputees, the system achieves robust recognition performance comparable to state-of-the-art myoelectric interfaces. When the vision pipeline restricts the decision space to three context-appropriate gestures for the currently viewed object, recognition accuracy increases to roughly 95% while excluding unsafe, object-inappropriate grasps. These results indicate that the proposed neuromorphic, context-aware controller can provide energy-efficient and reliable prosthesis control and has the potential to improve safety and usability in everyday activities for people with upper-limb amputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408sEMG\u548c\u89c6\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe95%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u56fe\uff08sEMG\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u7ebf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u5904\u7406\u5668AltAi\u4e0a\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u7c7bEMG\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u773c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5934\u663e\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8bc6\u522b\u7528\u6237\u6ce8\u89c6\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u516d\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u808c\u7535\u63a5\u53e3\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u4f53\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u624b\u52bf\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u7ea695%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6293\u63e1\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u80a2\u622a\u80a2\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, a gap remains between contemporary \"stateless\" video architectures and classic state-centric world model theories. This work bridges this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy centered on two pillars: State Construction and Dynamics Modeling. We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration.

Unlike differentiable mechanism design, which optimizes mechanisms forward, we infer mechanisms from behavior in an observational setting. We propose DIML, a likelihood-based framework that differentiates through a model of multi-agent learning dynamics and uses the candidate mechanism to generate counterfactual payoffs needed to predict observed actions. We establish identifiability of payoff differences under a conditional logit response model and prove statistical consistency of maximum likelihood estimation under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate DIML with simulated interactions of learning agents across unstructured neural mechanisms, congestion tolling, public goods subsidies, and large-scale anonymous games.

In this paper, we study to what extent future maintenance activity, as captured by the OpenSSF Maintained score, can be forecasted. We analyze 3,220 GitHub repositories associated with the top 1% most central PyPI libraries by PageRank and reconstruct historical Maintained scores over a three-year period. We formulate the task as multivariate time series forecasting and consider four target representations: raw scores, bucketed maintenance levels, numerical trend slopes, and categorical trend types. We compare a statistical model (VARMA), a machine learning model (Random Forest), and a deep learning model (LSTM) across training windows of 3-12 months and forecasting horizons of 1-6 months. Our results show that future maintenance activity can be predicted with meaningful accuracy, particularly for aggregated representations such as bucketed scores and trend types, achieving accuracies above 0.95 and 0.80, respectively. Simpler statistical and machine learning models perform on par with deep learning approaches, indicating that complex architectures are not required. These findings suggest that predictive modeling can effectively complement existing Scorecard metrics, enabling more proactive assessment of open-source maintenance risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4bOpenSSF Maintained\u5206\u6570\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "OpenSSF Scorecard\u7684Maintained\u6307\u6807\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u8fc7\u53bb90\u5929\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u67903,220\u4e2aGitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u7684Maintained\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83VARMA\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u672a\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u5206\u6876\u5206\u6570\u548c\u8d8b\u52bf\u7c7b\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8d85\u8fc70.95\u548c0.80\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7684Scorecard\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7ef4\u62a4\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, existing resources such as DexYCB and HO3D are primarily optimized for visual alignment but often yield physically implausible interactions when replayed in physics simulators, including penetration, missed contact, and unstable grasps.\n  We propose a simulation-in-the-loop refinement framework that converts these visually aligned trajectories into physically executable ones. Our core contribution is to formulate this as a tractable black-box optimization problem. We parameterize the hand's motion using a low-dimensional, spline-based representation built on sparse temporal keyframes. This allows us to use a powerful gradient-free optimizer, CMA-ES, to treat the high-fidelity physics engine as a black-box objective function. Our method finds motions that simultaneously maximize physical success (e.g., stable grasp and lift) while minimizing deviation from the original human demonstration.\n  Compared to MANIPTRANS-recent transfer pipelines, our approach achieves lower hand and object pose errors during replay and more accurately recovers hand-object physical interactions.

We argue this gap stems largely from the prevailing single-pass paradigm, which lacks the iterative reasoning, schema exploration, and error-correction behaviors that humans naturally employ. To address this limitation, we introduce SQL-Trail, a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) agentic framework for Text-to-SQL. Rather than producing a query in one shot, SQL-Trail interacts with the database environment and uses execution feedback to iteratively refine its predictions. Our approach centers on two key ideas: (i) an adaptive turn-budget allocation mechanism that scales the agent's interaction depth to match question difficulty, and (ii) a composite reward panel that jointly incentivizes SQL correctness and efficient exploration. Across benchmarks, SQL-Trail sets a new state of the art and delivers strong data efficiency--up to 18x higher than prior single-pass RL state-of-the-art methods.

By transforming data from a scarce resource into a controllable asset, LLMs mitigate the bottlenecks imposed by the acquisition costs of real-world data for model training, evaluation, and system iteration.

Existing research primarily focuses on generation methodologies, with limited direct attention to the quality of the resulting data.

More importantly, we systematically categorize intrinsic metrics for evaluating synthetic data from two dimensions: quality and trustworthiness. This approach shifts the focus from extrinsic evaluation, which relies on downstream task performance, to the inherent properties of the data itself. Using this evaluation system, we analyze the experimental evaluations of representative generation methods for each modality and identify substantial deficiencies in current evaluation practices. Based on these findings, we offer concrete recommendations for the community to improve the evaluation of data generation.

To address this, we present a systematic study of agentic mid-training, establishing both the data synthesis principles and training methodology for effective agent development at scale.

We verify the model's agentic capabilities on `SWE-Bench Verified`.

Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions.\n  To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control.\n  TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals.\n  This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects.\n  In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks.

However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP). GRASP introduces spatially structured soft prompts associated with spatial blocks extracted from a frozen visual token grid. Through a question-guided sparse fusion mechanism, GRASP dynamically aggregates task-specific context into a compact global prompt, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions while filtering out background noise. Extensive experiments on multiple RSVQA benchmarks show that GRASP achieves competitive performance compared to existing fine-tuning and prompt-based methods while maintaining high parameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRASP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u590d\u6742\u533a\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u9065\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "GRASP\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "GRASP\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRSVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GRASP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRSVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks predominantly target consumer-oriented scenarios (e.g., e-commerce and travel booking), failing to capture the complexity and rigor of professional enterprise workflows. Enterprise systems pose distinct challenges, including high-density user interfaces, strict business logic constraints, and a strong reliance on precise, state-consistent information retrieval-settings in which current generalist agents often struggle. To address this gap, we introduce EntWorld, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 1,756 tasks across six representative enterprise domains, including customer relationship management (CRM), information technology infrastructure library (ITIL), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Unlike previous datasets that depend on fragile execution traces or extensive manual annotation, EntWorld adopts a schema-grounded task generation framework that directly reverse-engineers business logic from underlying database schemas, enabling the synthesis of realistic, long-horizon workflows. Moreover, we propose a SQL-based deterministic verification mechanism in building datasets that replaces ambiguous visual matching with rigorous state-transition validation. Experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve 47.61% success rate on EntWorld, substantially lower than the human performance, highlighting a pronounced enterprise gap in current agentic capabilities and the necessity of developing domain-specific agents.

Objective: This paper audits recent software defect prediction (SDP) studies by assessing their experimental design, analysis, and reporting practices against accepted norms from statistics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. The aim is to characterise current practice and assess the reproducibility of published results. Method: We audited SDP studies indexed in SCOPUS between 2019 and 2023, focusing on design and analysis choices such as outcome measures, out of sample validation strategies, and the use of statistical inference. Nine study issues were evaluated. Reproducibility was assessed using the instrument proposed by Gonz\u00e1lez Barahona and Robles. Results: The search identified approximately 1,585 SDP experiments published during the period. From these, we randomly sampled 101 papers, including 61 journal and 40 conference publications, with almost 50 percent behind paywalls. We observed substantial variation in research practice. The number of datasets ranged from 1 to 365, learners or learner variants from 1 to 34, and performance measures from 1 to 9. About 45 percent of studies applied formal statistical inference. Across the sample, we identified 427 issues, with a median of four per paper, and only one paper without issues. Reproducibility ranged from near complete to severely limited. We also identified two cases of tortured phrases and possible paper mill activity.

Crash reports provide authentic specifications of safety-critical events, offering a vital alternative to scarce real-world collision trajectory data. This makes them valuable sources for generating realistic high-risk scenarios through simulation. Existing approaches face significant limitations because data-driven methods lack diversity due to their reliance on existing latent distributions, whereas adversarial methods often produce unrealistic scenarios lacking physical fidelity. Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM)-based methods show significant promise. However, they suffer from context suppression issues where internal parametric knowledge overrides crash specifications, producing scenarios that deviate from actual accident characteristics. This paper presents SG-CADVLM (A Context-Aware Decoding Powered Vision Language Model for Safety-Critical Scenario Generation), a framework that integrates Context-Aware Decoding with multi-modal input processing to generate safety-critical scenarios from crash reports and road network diagrams. The framework mitigates VLM hallucination issues while enabling the simultaneous generation of road geometry and vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-CADVLM generates critical risk scenarios at a rate of 84.4% compared to 12.5% for the baseline methods, representing an improvement of 469%, while producing executable simulations for autonomous vehicle testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "SG-CADVLM\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u4e14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u662f\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u66ff\u4ee3\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "SG-CADVLM\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u56fe\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9053\u8def\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSG-CADVLM\u751f\u6210\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a84.4%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u768412.5%\u63d0\u5347\u4e86469%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "SG-CADVLM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8LoD\u8349\u56fe\u63d0\u53d6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u7b80\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLoD\u5efa\u6a21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u4ece\u8349\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9LoD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u8be6\u7ec6\u8868\u793a\u5230\u4f53\u79ef\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LoD\u7ea7\u522b\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cSSIM\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.7319\uff08LoD3\u5230LoD2\uff09\u548c0.7532\uff08LoD2\u5230LoD1\uff09\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u768425.1%\u548c61.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\uff08LoD\uff09\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u5efa\u7b51\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, generating such features is challenging: it requires reasoning over complex schemas and exploring a combinatorially large feature space, all without explicit supervision. To address these challenges, we propose ReFuGe, an agentic framework that leverages specialized large language model agents: (1) a schema selection agent identifies the tables and columns relevant to the task, (2) a feature generation agent produces diverse candidate features from the selected schema, and (3) a feature filtering agent evaluates and retains promising features through reasoning-based and validation-based filtering. It operates within an iterative feedback loop until performance converges. Experiments on RDB benchmarks demonstrate that ReFuGe substantially improves performance on various RDB prediction tasks.

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled language-driven navigation with improved interpretability. However, most LLM-based agents still rely on single-shot action decisions, where the model must choose one option from noisy, textualized multi-perspective observations. Due to local mismatches and imperfect intermediate reasoning, such decisions can easily deviate from the correct path, leading to error accumulation and reduced reliability in unseen environments. In this paper, we propose DV-VLN, a new VLN framework that follows a generate-then-verify paradigm. DV-VLN first performs parameter-efficient in-domain adaptation of an open-source LLaMA-2 backbone to produce a structured navigational chain-of-thought, and then verifies candidate actions with two complementary channels: True-False Verification (TFV) and Masked-Entity Verification (MEV). DV-VLN selects actions by aggregating verification successes across multiple samples, yielding interpretable scores for reranking. Experiments on R2R, RxR (English subset), and REVERIE show that DV-VLN consistently improves over direct prediction and sampling-only baselines, achieving competitive performance among language-only VLN agents and promising results compared with several cross-modal systems.Code is available at https://github.com/PlumJun/DV-VLN.", "AI": {"tldr": "DV-VLN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4ee3\u7406\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b21\u52a8\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u504f\u79bb\u6b63\u786e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "DV-VLN\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5185\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u7684LLaMA-2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7True-False Verification (TFV)\u548cMasked-Entity Verification (MEV)\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u901a\u9053\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728R2R\u3001RxR\uff08\u82f1\u6587\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u548cREVERIE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDV-VLN\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DV-VLN\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4ec5\u91c7\u6837\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case.

Specifically, we analyze their usage by dependent projects on GitHub, examining how they invoke the frameworks' APIs and commands. Then, we qualitatively analyze feature requests and enhancements mined from the frameworks' issue trackers, relating these desired improvements to the previously identified usage features. Results indicate that MLOps frameworks are rarely used out-of-the-box and are infrequently integrated into GitHub Workflows, but rather, developers use their APIs to implement custom functionality in their projects. Used features concern core ML phases and whole infrastructure governance, sometimes leveraging multiple frameworks with complementary features.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain global directional consistency, leading to drifting or implausible trajectories when extrapolated over long time horizons. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-key-point-conditioned trajectory modeling framework, in which future trajectories are predicted by conditioning on a high-level Next Key Point (NKP) that captures navigational intent. This formulation decomposes long-horizon prediction into global semantic decision-making and local motion modeling, effectively restricting the support of future trajectories to semantically feasible subsets. To efficiently estimate the NKP prior from historical observations, we adopt a pretrain-finetune strategy.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2026", "summary": "Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

Traditional predictive models often struggle to generalize across heterogeneous datasets and complex physiological patterns. To address this, we propose a hybrid ensemble framework that integrates deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with classical machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), using an ensemble voting mechanism. This approach combines the representational power of deep networks with the interpretability and efficiency of traditional models. Experiments on two publicly available Kaggle datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance, reaching 82.30 percent accuracy on Dataset I and 97.10 percent on Dataset II, with consistent gains in precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings underscore the robustness and clinical potential of hybrid AI frameworks for predicting cardiovascular disease and facilitating early intervention.

Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDF) enable fixed-base manipulators to model collisions directly in configuration space via smooth, implicit distances. This representation holds strong potential to bypass the nonlinear configuration-to-workspace mapping while preserving accurate whole-body geometry and providing optimization-friendly collision costs. Yet, extending this capability to mobile manipulators is hindered by unbounded workspaces and tighter base-arm coupling. We lift this promise to mobile manipulation with Generalized Configuration Space Distance Fields (GCDF), extending CDF to robots with both translational and rotational joints in unbounded workspaces with tighter base-arm coupling. We prove that GCDF preserves Euclidean-like local distance structure and accurately encodes whole-body geometry in configuration space, and develop a data generation and training pipeline that yields continuous neural GCDFs with accurate values and gradients, supporting efficient GPU-batched queries. Building on this representation, we develop a high-performance sequential convex optimization framework centered on GCDF-based collision reasoning.

This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA.

In LLM-based agentic workflows, such violations can propagate and amplify along reasoning chains, causing task failures and system incidents. This paper presents NSVIF, a neuro-symbolic framework for verifying whether an LLM's output follows the instructions used to prompt the LLM. NSVIF is a universal, general-purpose verifier; it makes no assumption about the instruction or the LLM. NSVIF formulates instruction-following verification as a constraint-satisfaction problem by modeling user instructions as constraints. NSVIF models both logical and semantic constraints; constraint solving is done by a unified solver that orchestrates logical reasoning and semantic analysis. To evaluate NSVIF, we develop VIFBENCH, a new benchmark for instruction-following verifiers with fine-grained data labels. Experiments show that NSVIF significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches and provides interpretable feedback.

In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u5411Devito\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u7684AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408LangGraph\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u6863\u89e3\u6790\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLeiden\u7684\u793e\u533a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684Devito\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002GraphRAG\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u4e49\u793e\u533a\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u53cd\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7Fortran\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3aRAG\u68c0\u7d22\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e09\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548cG-Eval\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5168\u6027\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cAPI\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728LangGraph\u6846\u67b6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u53d1\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

However, previous methods mainly focused on environment-level visual real-to-sim transfer, ignoring the transfer of interactions, which could be challenging and inefficient to obtain purely in simulation especially for contact-rich tasks. We propose ExoGS, a robot-free 4D Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that captures both static environments and dynamic interactions in the real world and transfers them seamlessly to a simulated environment. It provides a new solution for scalable manipulation data collection and policy learning. ExoGS employs a self-designed robot-isomorphic passive exoskeleton AirExo-3 to capture kinematically consistent trajectories with millimeter-level accuracy and synchronized RGB observations during direct human demonstrations. The robot, objects, and environment are reconstructed as editable 3D Gaussian Splatting assets, enabling geometry-consistent replay and large-scale data augmentation. Additionally, a lightweight Mask Adapter injects instance-level semantics into the policy to enhance robustness under visual domain shifts. Real-world experiments demonstrate that ExoGS significantly improves data efficiency and policy generalization compared to teleoperation-based baselines.

Compliance teams must interpret evolving rules across jurisdictions, formats, and agencies, often manually, at high cost and risk of error. We introduce RegGuard, an industrial-scale AI assistant designed to automate the interpretation of heterogeneous regulatory texts and align them with internal corporate policies. The system ingests heterogeneous document sources through a secure pipeline and enhances retrieval and generation quality with two novel components: HiSACC (Hierarchical Semantic Aggregation for Contextual Chunking) semantically segments long documents into coherent units while maintaining consistency across non-contiguous sections.

Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize \"interaction\" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u793e\u4f1a\u8d44\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e92\u52a8\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u9aa8\u9abc\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u6d41\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "DUET\u6355\u6349\u4e8612\u79cd\u4e8c\u5143\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u4e94\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4ea4\u6d41\u529f\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "DUET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

IGFT combines online Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with information-theoretic rewards, enabling models to learn from self-generated conversations with simulated patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on expensive expert-annotated conversations or static datasets, our online RL framework allows models to discover effective questioning strategies through exploration. Our key innovation is an information gain reward function that tracks which clinical entities such as symptoms, temporal patterns, and medical history, are revealed during conversation. Each question's reward is computed based on its expected information gain combined with GPT-4o-mini quality assessments across dimensions including clinical relevance, patient engagement, and specificity. This hybrid approach ensures models learn to ask targeted, clinically appropriate questions that efficiently gather diagnostic information.

To study this phenomenon, we introduce PS-Bench, a benchmark designed to identify and quantify intent legitimation in personalized interactions. Across multiple memory-augmented agent frameworks and base LLMs, personalization increases attack success rates by 15.8%-243.7% relative to stateless baselines. We further provide mechanistic evidence for intent legitimation from internal representations space, and propose a lightweight detection-reflection method that effectively reduces safety degradation.

Current paradigms rely on binary success rates, failing to address the critical dimensions of trust: Source Authenticity (i.e., distinguishing genuine policy behaviors from human teleoperation) and Execution Quality (e.g., smoothness and safety). To bridge these gaps, we propose a solution that combines the Eval-Actions benchmark and the AutoEval architecture. First, we construct the Eval-Actions benchmark to support trustworthiness analysis. Distinct from existing datasets restricted to successful human demonstrations, Eval-Actions integrates VA and VLA policy execution trajectories alongside human teleoperation data, explicitly including failure scenarios. This dataset is structured around three core supervision signals: Expert Grading (EG), Rank-Guided preferences (RG), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Building on this, we propose the AutoEval architecture: AutoEval leverages Spatio-Temporal Aggregation for semantic assessment, augmented by an auxiliary Kinematic Calibration Signal to refine motion smoothness; AutoEval Plus (AutoEval-P) incorporates the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) paradigm to enhance logical reasoning capabilities. Experiments show AutoEval achieves Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficients (SRCC) of 0.81 and 0.84 under the EG and RG protocols, respectively.

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528V-JEPA\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u6d4b\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u9700\u6c42\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing interpretability methods remain limited in explaining how cognitive abilities are engaged during LLM reasoning. In this paper, we propose UniCog, a unified framework that analyzes LLM cognition via a latent mind space. Formulated as a latent variable model, UniCog encodes diverse abilities from dense model activations into sparse, disentangled latent dimensions. Through extensive analysis on six advanced LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3.2 and GPT-4o, we reveal a Pareto principle of LLM cognition, where a shared reasoning core is complemented by ability-specific signatures. Furthermore, we discover that reasoning failures often manifest as anomalous intensity in latent activations. These findings opens a new paradigm in LLM analysis, providing a cognition grounded view of reasoning dynamics. Finally, leveraging these insights, we introduce a latent-informed candidate prioritization strategy, which improves reasoning performance by up to 7.5% across challenging benchmarks.

Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716.

These investigations exhibit hidden dependency structure: entities interact, signals co-vary, and the importance of a fact may only become clear after other evidence is discovered. Because the context window is bounded, agents must summarize intermediate findings before their significance is known, increasing the risk of discarding key evidence. ReAct-style agents are especially brittle in this regime. Their retrieve-summarize-reason loop makes conclusions sensitive to exploration order and introduces run-to-run non-determinism, producing a reliability gap where Pass-at-k may be high but Majority-at-k remains low. Simply sampling more rollouts or generating longer reasoning traces does not reliably stabilize results, since hypotheses cannot be autonomously checked as new evidence arrives and there is no explicit mechanism for belief bookkeeping and revision. In addition, ReAct entangles semantic reasoning with controller duties such as tool orchestration and state tracking, so execution errors and plan drift degrade reasoning while consuming scarce context.\n  We address these issues by formulating investigation as abductive reasoning over a dependency graph and proposing EoG (Explanations over Graphs), a disaggregated framework in which an LLM performs bounded local evidence mining and labeling (cause vs symptom) while a deterministic controller manages traversal, state, and belief propagation to compute a minimal explanatory frontier. On a representative ITBench diagnostics task, EoG improves both accuracy and run-to-run consistency over ReAct baselines, including a 7x average gain in Majority-at-k entity F1.", "AI": {"tldr": "EoG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bbLLM\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEoG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7684\u672c\u5730\u8bc1\u636e\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728ITBench\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEoG\u76f8\u6bd4ReAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Majority-at-k\u5b9e\u4f53F1\u63d0\u5347\u4e867\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EoG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8c03\u67e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing FDR frameworks exhibit various limitations, such as significant delays in communication and computation, and unreliability in robot motion/trajectory generation, mainly because the communication-computation-control (3C) loop is designed without considering the downstream FDR goal. To address this, we propose a novel Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) framework that jointly designs the 3C loop tailored for fast and robust robotic FDR, with the goal of minimising the FDR time while maximising the robotic task (e.g., workpiece sorting) success rate. For fault detection, our GoC framework innovatively defines and extracts the 3D scene graph (3D-SG) as the semantic representation via our designed representation extractor, and detects faults by monitoring spatial relationship changes in the 3D-SG. For fault recovery, we fine-tune a small language model (SLM) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and enhance its reasoning and generalization capabilities via knowledge distillation to generate recovery motions for robots. We also design a lightweight goal-oriented digital twin reconstruction module to refine the recovery motions generated by the SLM when fine-grained robotic control is required, using only task-relevant object contours for digital twin reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our GoC framework reduces the FDR time by up to 82.6% and improves the task success rate by up to 76%, compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on vision language models for fault detection and large language models for fault recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FDR\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1-\u8ba1\u7b97-\u63a7\u5236\uff083C\uff09\u5faa\u73af\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316FDR\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff083D-SG\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "GoC\u6846\u67b6\u5c06FDR\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe82.6%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe76%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\uff08GoC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\uff08FDR\uff09\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We investigate this in a challenging real-time control setting (Dark Souls III) by representing combat as a directed skill graph and training its components in a hierarchical curriculum. The resulting agent decomposes control into five reusable skills: camera control, target lock-on, movement, dodging, and a heal-attack decision policy, each optimized for a narrow responsibility. This factorization improves sample efficiency by reducing the burden on any single policy and supports selective post-training: when the environment shifts from Phase 1 to Phase 2, only a subset of skills must be adapted, while upstream skills remain transferable.

Existing vision-language-action models often fail to generalize because (i) multi-view features are fused via view-agnostic token concatenation, yielding weak 3D-consistent spatial understanding, and (ii) language is injected as global conditioning, resulting in coarse instruction grounding.\n  In this paper, we introduce PEAfowl, a perception-enhanced multi-view VLA policy for bimanual manipulation. For spatial reasoning, PEAfowl predicts per-token depth distributions, performs differentiable 3D lifting, and aggregates local cross-view neighbors to form geometrically grounded, cross-view consistent representations. For instruction grounding, we propose to replace global conditioning with a Perceiver-style text-aware readout over frozen CLIP visual features, enabling iterative evidence accumulation. To overcome noisy and incomplete commodity depth without adding inference overhead, we apply training-only depth distillation from a pretrained depth teacher to supervise the depth-distribution head, providing perception front-end with geometry-aware priors.\n  On RoboTwin 2.0 under domain-randomized setting, PEAfowl improves the strongest baseline by 23.0 pp in success rate, and real-robot experiments further demonstrate reliable sim-to-real transfer and consistent improvements from depth distillation.\n  Project website: https://peafowlvla.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEAfowl\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56feVLA\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u63a5\u5730\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u63a5\u5730\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "PEAfowl\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u5fae3D\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u90bb\u5c45\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Perceiver\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u8bfb\u53d6\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728RoboTwin 2.0\u4e0a\uff0cPEAfowl\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8623.0\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PEAfowl\u5728RoboTwin 2.0\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches.

By enabling users to query databases through natural language rather than SQL, this technology significantly lowers the barrier to data analysis. However, generating accurate SQL from natural language remains challenging due to ambiguity in user queries, the complexity of schema linking, limited generalization across SQL dialects, and the need for domain-specific understanding. In this study, we propose a Single-Agent Self-Refinement with Ensemble Voting (SSEV) pipeline built on PET-SQL that operates without ground-truth data, integrating self-refinement with Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) and its randomized variant (RWMA). Experimental results show that the SSEV achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks, attaining execution accuracies of 85.5% on Spider 1.0-Dev, 86.4% on Spider 1.0-Test, and 66.3% on BIRD-Dev. Building on insights from the SSEV pipeline, we further propose ReCAPAgent-SQL (Refinement-Critique-Act-Plan agent-based SQL framework) to address the growing complexity of enterprise databases and real-world Text-to-SQL tasks.

Capturing pixel-aligned metric depth using RGB-D cameras would be the most viable way, yet it usually faces obstacles posed by hardware limitations and challenging imaging conditions, especially in the presence of specular or texture-less surfaces. In this work, we argue that the inaccuracies from depth sensors can be viewed as \"masked\" signals that inherently reflect underlying geometric ambiguities. Building on this motivation, we present LingBot-Depth, a depth completion model which leverages visual context to refine depth maps through masked depth modeling and incorporates an automated data curation pipeline for scalable training. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms top-tier RGB-D cameras in terms of both depth precision and pixel coverage. Experimental results on a range of downstream tasks further suggest that LingBot-Depth offers an aligned latent representation across RGB and depth modalities.

Existing methods attempt to leverage complementary information from multiple projections, but struggle with balancing global and local consistency. Their local patch features have limited global perception, and the combined global representation does not address discrepancies in feature extraction at the boundaries between patches. To address these issues, we propose Cross360, a novel cross-attention-based architecture integrating local and global information using less-distorted tangent patches along with equirectangular features. Our Cross Projection Feature Alignment module employs cross-attention to align local tangent projection features with the equirectangular projection's 360\u00b0 field of view, ensuring each tangent projection patch is aware of the global context.

We tested this assumption in mental health, where high safety stakes make expert consensus essential. Three certified psychiatrists independently evaluated LLM-generated responses using a calibrated rubric. Despite similar training and shared instructions, inter-rater reliability was consistently poor ($ICC$ $0.087$--$0.295$), falling below thresholds considered acceptable for consequential assessment. Disagreement was highest on the most safety-critical items. Suicide and self-harm responses produced greater divergence than any other category, and was systematic rather than random. One factor yielded negative reliability (Krippendorff's $\u03b1= -0.203$), indicating structured disagreement worse than chance. Qualitative interviews revealed that disagreement reflects coherent but incompatible individual clinical frameworks, safety-first, engagement-centered, and culturally-informed orientations, rather than measurement error. By demonstrating that experts rely on holistic risk heuristics rather than granular factor discrimination, these findings suggest that aggregated labels function as arithmetic compromises that effectively erase grounded professional philosophies.

Although State Space Models (SSMs) offer near-linear computational complexity, their dependence on rigid, axis-aligned scanning trajectories induces a fundamental topological mismatch with curvilinear targets, resulting in fragmented context and feature erosion. To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%. Achieving a real-time inference speed of over 24 FPS with only 3.4M parameters and 6.3G FLOPs, Fluxamba reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude compared to heavy-weight baselines, thereby establishing a new Pareto frontier between segmentation fidelity and onboard deployment feasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fluxamba\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SFB\u5b9e\u73b0\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u8d28\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u5730\u8d28\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u9700\u8981\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u73b0\u6709State Space Models (SSMs)\u4f9d\u8d56\u521a\u6027\u3001\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u626b\u63cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u66f2\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4fb5\u8680\u3002", "method": "Fluxamba\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662fStructural Flux Block (SFB)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG)\u548cPrior-Modulated Flow (PMF)\u5b9e\u73b0\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5305\u542bHierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR)\u548cHigh-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU)\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "Fluxamba\u5728LROC-Lineament\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523089.22%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u548c89.87%\u7684mIoU\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc724 FPS\uff0c\u4ec5\u97003.4M\u53c2\u6570\u548c6.3G FLOPs\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Fluxamba\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5730\u8d28\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728LROC-Lineament\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8689.22%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u548c89.87%\u7684mIoU\u3002\u5176\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684Pareto\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Dynamic Meta-Ensemble Framework (DMEF) for high-accuracy plant disease diagnosis under resource constraints. DMEF employs an adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically combines the predictions of three lightweight convolutional neural networks (MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and InceptionV3) by optimizing a trade-off between accuracy improvements (DeltaAcc) and computational efficiency (model size). During training, the ensemble weights are updated iteratively, favoring models exhibiting high performance and low complexity.

Conventional deep learning approaches typically formulate this problem as deterministic multi-class classification, ignoring both the continuous progression of degeneration and the uncertainty in expert annotations. In this work, we propose ClinNet, a novel trustworthy framework that addresses KOA grading as an evidential ordinal regression problem. The proposed method integrates three key components: (1) a Bilateral Asymmetry Encoder (BAE) that explicitly models medial-lateral structural discrepancies; (2) a Diagnostic Memory Bank that maintains class-wise prototypes to stabilize feature representations; and (3) an Evidential Ordinal Head based on the Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution to jointly estimate continuous KL grades and epistemic uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClinNet achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.892 and Accuracy of 0.768, statistically outperforming state-of-the-art baselines (p < 0.001).

We study deadline-aware control, where the aim is to reach a target temperature at a specified time while minimising energy consumption. We introduce an efficient Gymnasium environment that models an immersion hot water heater with first-order thermal losses and discrete on and off actions of 0 W and 6000 W applied every 120 seconds. Methods include a time-optimal bang-bang baseline, a zero-shot Monte Carlo Tree Search planner, and a Proximal Policy Optimisation policy. We report total energy consumption in watt-hours under identical physical dynamics. Across sweeps of initial temperature from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, deadline from 30 to 90 steps, and target temperature from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius, PPO achieves the most energy-efficient performance at a 60-step horizon of 2 hours, using 3.23 kilowatt-hours, compared to 4.37 to 10.45 kilowatt-hours for bang-bang control and 4.18 to 6.46 kilowatt-hours for MCTS. This corresponds to energy savings of 26 percent at 30 steps and 69 percent at 90 steps. In a representative trajectory with a 50 kg water mass, 20 degrees Celsius ambient temperature, and a 60 degrees Celsius target, PPO consumes 54 percent less energy than bang-bang control and 33 percent less than MCTS.

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized.\n  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

Existing methods employ LLM judges to filter responses, yet still require all models to perform inference before judging, failing to cut costs effectively. They also lack model selection criteria and struggle with large model pools, where full inference is costly and can exceed context limits. To address this, we propose RouteMoA, an efficient mixture-of-agents framework with dynamic routing. It employs a lightweight scorer to perform initial screening by predicting coarse-grained performance from the query, narrowing candidates to a high-potential subset without inference. A mixture of judges then refines these scores through lightweight self- and cross-assessment based on existing model outputs, providing posterior correction without additional inference. Finally, a model ranking mechanism selects models by balancing performance, cost, and latency.

In sequential letter presentation, the afterimage of one symbol can interfere with perception of the next, leading to systematic recognition errors. Rather than relying on future hardware improvements, we investigate whether optimizing the visual symbols themselves can mitigate this temporal interference. We present SymbolSight, a computational framework that selects symbol-to-letter mappings to minimize confusion among frequently adjacent letters. Using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) and a neural proxy observer, we estimate pairwise symbol confusability and optimize assignments using language-specific bigram statistics. Across simulations in Arabic, Bulgarian, and English, the resulting heterogeneous symbol sets reduced predicted confusion by a median factor of 22 relative to native alphabets.

At the initial clinical encounters, physicians assess rare disease risk using only limited information under high uncertainty. When high-risk patients are not recognised at this stage, targeted diagnostic testing is often not initiated, resulting in missed diagnosis. Existing primary care triage processes are structurally insufficient to reliably identify patients with rare diseases at initial clinical presentation and universal screening is needed to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we present RareAlert, an early screening system which predict patient-level rare disease risk from routinely available primary-visit information. RareAlert integrates reasoning generated by ten LLMs, calibrates and weights these signals using machine learning, and distils the aligned reasoning into a single locally deployable model. To develop and evaluate RareAlert, we curated RareBench, a real-world dataset of 158,666 cases covering 33 Orphanet disease categories and more than 7,000 rare conditions, including both rare and non-rare presentations. The results showed that rare disease identification can be reconceptualised as a universal uncertainty resolution process applied to the general patient population. On an independent test set, RareAlert, a Qwen3-4B based model trained with calibrated reasoning signals, achieved an AUC of 0.917, outperforming the best machine learning ensemble and all evaluated LLMs, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, o3-mini, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen3-235B. These findings demonstrate the diversity in LLM medical reasoning and the effectiveness of aligning such reasoning in highly uncertain clinical tasks. By incorporating calibrated reasoning into a single model, RareAlert enables accurate, privacy-preserving, and scalable rare disease risk screening suitable for large-scale local deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "RareAlert\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u7684\u6f0f\u8bca\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bca\u65ad\u662f\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u521d\u7ea7\u62a4\u7406\u5206\u8bca\u6d41\u7a0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u7528\u7b5b\u67e5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "RareAlert\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5341\u4e2aLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRareAlert\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-4B\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684AUC\u8fbe\u52300.917\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684LLM\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "RareAlert\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

While convolutional neural network-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based U-Net variants have achieved strong performance, they still struggle to capture geometric and structural cues, especially in low-contrast or cluttered colonoscopy scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometric Prior-guided Module (GPM) that injects explicit geometric priors into U-Net-based architectures for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we fine-tune the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) on a simulated ColonDepth dataset to estimate depth maps of polyp images tailored to the endoscopic domain. These depth maps are then processed by GPM to encode geometric priors into the encoder's feature maps, where they are further refined using spatial and channel attention mechanisms that emphasize both local spatial and global channel information. GPM is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into diverse U-Net variants.

To address this, we introduce DeepPlanning, a challenging benchmark for practical long-horizon agent planning. It features multi-day travel planning and multi-product shopping tasks that require proactive information acquisition, local constrained reasoning, and global constrained optimization. Evaluations on DeepPlanning show that even frontier agentic LLMs struggle with these problems, highlighting the importance of reliable explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use for achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs.

This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\u03c7^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "Success conditioning solves a trust-region optimization problem, ensuring conservative policy improvement without performance degradation, with observable minimal changes indicating failure.", "motivation": "To clarify the optimization problem solved by success conditioning, a widely used technique in policy improvement, and its implications.", "method": "The paper proves that success conditioning solves a trust-region optimization problem with a $\u03c7^2$ divergence constraint, automatically determined by data.", "result": "Success conditioning maximizes policy improvement under a $\u03c7^2$ divergence constraint, establishing an identity linking relative policy improvement, policy change magnitude, and action-influence.", "conclusion": "Success conditioning emerges as a conservative improvement operator, ensuring performance does not degrade and observable failure when policy changes minimally."}}

However, the scarcity of text image data in existing datasets results in poor performance on text regions. In addition, datasets consisting of isolated text samples limit the quality of background reconstruction. To address these limitations, we construct Real-Texts, a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from real-world images, which covers diverse scenarios and contains natural text instances in both Chinese and English. Additionally, we propose the TEXTS-Aware Diffusion Model (TEXTS-Diff) to achieve high-quality generation in both background and textual regions. This approach leverages abstract concepts to improve the understanding of textual elements within visual scenes and concrete text regions to enhance textual details.

However, in practical applications, the missing of modality data (e.g., optical or DSM) is a common and severe challenge, which leads to performance decline in traditional multimodal fusion models. Existing methods for addressing missing modalities still face limitations, including feature collapse and overly generalized recovered features.

While recent methods employ disentangling strategies to simplify lightweight architectural design, such as Retinex theory and YUV color space transformations, their performance is fundamentally limited by overlooking channel-specific degradation patterns and cross-channel interactions. To address this gap, we perform a frequency-domain analysis that confirms the superiority of the YUV color space for L3IE. We identify a key insight: the Y channel primarily loses low-frequency content, while the UV channels are corrupted by high-frequency noise. Leveraging this finding, we propose a novel YUV-based paradigm that strategically restores channels using a Dual-Stream Global-Local Attention module for the Y channel, a Y-guided Local-Aware Frequency Attention module for the UV channels, and a Guided Interaction module for final feature fusion.

In this work, we investigate the challenge of agentic post-training when the eventual test domains are unknown. Specifically, we analyze which properties of reinforcement learning (RL) environments and modeling choices have the greatest influence on out-of-domain performance. First, we identify two environment axes that strongly correlate with cross-domain generalization: (i) state information richness, i.e., the amount of information for the agent to process from the state, and (ii) planning complexity, estimated via goal reachability and trajectory length under a base policy. Notably, domain realism and text-level similarity are not the primary factors; for instance, the simple grid-world domain Sokoban leads to even stronger generalization in SciWorld than the more realistic ALFWorld. Motivated by these findings, we further show that increasing state information richness alone can already effectively improve cross-domain robustness. We propose a randomization technique, which is low-overhead and broadly applicable: add small amounts of distractive goal-irrelevant features to the state to make it richer without altering the task. Beyond environment-side properties, we also examine several modeling choices: (a) SFT warmup or mid-training helps prevent catastrophic forgetting during RL but undermines generalization to domains that are not included in the mid-training datamix; and (b) turning on step-by-step thinking during RL, while not always improving in-domain performance, plays a crucial role in preserving generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u54ea\u4e9bRL\u73af\u5883\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790RL\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u9886\u57df\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684SFT\u9884\u70ed\u6216\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62RL\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u5bf9\u672a\u5305\u542b\u5728\u4e2d\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, traditional classification methods such as discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines often struggle with environmental noise in data, sensor limitations, and the computational complexity of analyzing high-dimensional HSI data. This study presents HyDeMiC (Hyperspectral Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for robust mineral classification under noisy data. To train HyDeMiC, laboratory-measured hyperspectral data for 115 minerals spanning various mineral groups were used from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) library. The training dataset was generated by convolving reference mineral spectra with an HSI sensor response function. These datasets contained three copper-bearing minerals, Cuprite, Malachite, and Chalcopyrite, used as case studies for performance demonstration. The trained CNN model was evaluated on several synthetic 2D hyperspectral datasets with noise levels of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Our noisy data analysis aims to replicate realistic field conditions. The HyDeMiC's performance was assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), providing a comprehensive measure across different noise regimes. Results demonstrate that HyDeMiC achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (MCC = 1.00) on clean and low-noise datasets and maintained strong performance under moderate noise conditions.

Their reliance on static toolsets or offline training lags behind these dynamics, leaving the system's capability boundaries rigid and unknown. To address this, we propose the In-Situ Self-Evolving paradigm. This approach treats sequential task interactions as a continuous stream of experience, enabling the system to distill short-term execution feedback into long-term, reusable capabilities without access to ground-truth labels. Within this framework, we identify tool evolution as the critical pathway for capability expansion, which provides verifiable, binary feedback signals. Within this framework, we develop Yunjue Agent, a system that iteratively synthesizes, optimizes, and reuses tools to navigate emerging challenges. To optimize evolutionary efficiency, we further introduce a Parallel Batch Evolution strategy. Empirical evaluations across five diverse benchmarks under a zero-start setting demonstrate significant performance gains over proprietary baselines. Additionally, complementary warm-start evaluations confirm that the accumulated general knowledge can be seamlessly transferred to novel domains. Finally, we propose a novel metric to monitor evolution convergence, serving as a function analogous to training loss in conventional optimization.

While existing approaches like chain-of-thought prompting operate at the agent level, they fail to provide fine-grained reasoning guidance for individual function parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Think-Augmented Function Calling (TAFC), a novel framework that enhances function calling accuracy through explicit reasoning at both function and parameter levels. Our method introduces a universal \"think\" parameter augmentation that enables models to articulate their decision-making process, with dynamic optimization for parameter descriptions to improve reasoning quality. For complex parameters, TAFC automatically triggers granular reasoning based on complexity scoring, ensuring appropriate justification for critical decisions. Additionally, we propose reasoning-guided optimization to align generated reasoning with human expectations. TAFC requires no architectural modifications to existing LLMs while maintaining full API compatibility.

Our UCAD leverages superpixels to generate anatomically coherent regions aligned with anatomy boundaries, and an uncertainty-guided selection mechanism to selectively displace challenging regions for better consistency learning.

While LVLMs are known to be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, existing methods either require access to input channels or depend on knowledge of user queries, assumptions that rarely hold in practical deployments. We propose the first Physical Prompt Injection Attack (PPIA), a black-box, query-agnostic attack that embeds malicious typographic instructions into physical objects perceivable by the LVLM. PPIA requires no access to the model, its inputs, or internal pipeline, and operates solely through visual observation. It combines offline selection of highly recognizable and semantically effective visual prompts with strategic environment-aware placement guided by spatiotemporal attention, ensuring that the injected prompts are both perceivable and influential on model behavior. We evaluate PPIA across 10 state-of-the-art LVLMs in both simulated and real-world settings on tasks including visual question answering, planning, and navigation, PPIA achieves attack success rates up to 98%, with strong robustness under varying physical conditions such as distance, viewpoint, and illumination.

This assumption is challenged by Generative AI that can emulate thousands of author styles in seconds with negligible marginal labor. To understand this better, we conducted a behavioral experiment where 28 MFA writers (experts) competed against three LLMs in emulating 50 critically acclaimed authors. Based on blind pairwise comparisons by 28 expert judges and 131 lay judges, we find that experts preferred human writing in 82.7% of cases under the in-context prompting condition but this reversed to 62% preference for AI after fine-tuning on authors' complete works. Lay judges, however, consistently preferred AI writing. Debrief interviews with expert writers revealed that their preference for AI writing triggered an identity crisis, eroding aesthetic confidence and questioning what constitutes \"good writing.\" These findings challenge discourse about AI's creative limitations and raise fundamental questions about the future of creative labor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u4f5c\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u9006\u8f6c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u59d4\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6311\u6218\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u4f5c\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c28\u540dMFA\u4f5c\u5bb6\u4e0e\u4e09\u4e2aLLM\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u4eff50\u4f4d\u77e5\u540d\u4f5c\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f2\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u666e\u901a\u8bc4\u59d4\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u59d4\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b82.7%\u504f\u597d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728AI\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u504f\u597d\u9006\u8f6c\u81f362%\u652f\u6301AI\uff1b\u666e\u901a\u8bc4\u59d4\u5219\u59cb\u7ec8\u66f4\u504f\u597dAI\u5199\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86AI\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u521b\u610f\u52b3\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u601d\u8003\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Watermarking methods have always been effective means of protecting intellectual property, yet they face significant challenges. Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions. In particular, our method outperforms the stable signature method by an average of 10\\% across 12 different image transformations on COCO datasets.

This paper reexamines the key SMVRL design stages for EAR and propose: (i) a principled spatiotemporal multi-view representation through translation-invariant dense conversion of sparse events, (ii) a dual-branch, dynamic fusion architecture that models sample-wise complementarity between motion features from different views, and (iii) a bio-inspired temporal warping augmentation that mimics speed variability of real-world human actions. On three challenging EAR datasets of HARDVS, DailyDVS-200 and THU-EACT-50-CHL, we show +7.0%, +10.7%, and +10.2% Top-1 accuracy gains over existing SMVRL EOR method with surprising 30.1% reduced parameters and 35.7% lower computations, establishing our framework as a novel and powerful EAR paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SMVRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ffb\u8bd1\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u7bb1\u8868\u793a\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u7b80\u5355\u62fc\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SMVRL\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\uff1a\uff08i\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u7a00\u758f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\uff08iii\uff09\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728HARDVS\u3001DailyDVS-200\u548cTHU-EACT-50-CHL\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.0%\u300110.7%\u548c10.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1130.1%\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e35.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08EAR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5bc6\u96c6\u8f6c\u6362\u7a00\u758f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002"}}

While static leaderboards provide snapshot rankings, they often mask the structural trade-offs between capabilities. In this work, we present ReLE (Robust Efficient Live Evaluation), a scalable system designed to diagnose Capability Anisotropy, the non-uniformity of model performance across domains. Using ReLE, we evaluate 304 models (189 commercial, 115 open-source) across a Domain $\\times$ Capability orthogonal matrix comprising 207,843 samples. We introduce two methodological contributions to address current evaluation pitfalls: (1) A Symbolic-Grounded Hybrid Scoring Mechanism that eliminates embedding-based false positives in reasoning tasks; (2) A Dynamic Variance-Aware Scheduler based on Neyman allocation with noise correction, which reduces compute costs by 70\\% compared to full-pass evaluations while maintaining a ranking correlation of $\u03c1=0.96$. Our analysis reveals that aggregate rankings are highly sensitive to weighting schemes: models exhibit a Rank Stability Amplitude (RSA) of 11.4 in ReLE versus $\\sim$5.0 in traditional benchmarks, confirming that modern models are highly specialized rather than generally superior.

In this paper, we demonstrate that expensive online reinforcement learning is not all you need to build powerful research agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fully open-source suite designed for effective offline training. Our core contributions include DeepForge, a ready-to-use task synthesis framework that generates large-scale research queries without heavy preprocessing; and a curated collection of 66k QA pairs, 33k SFT trajectories, and 21k DPO pairs.

While Vision-Language (V-L) models promise data efficiency by leveraging semantic priors, adapting them faces a critical Granularity Mismatch, where generic representations fail to resolve such subtle defects. Current adaptation methods often treat modalities as independent streams, failing to ground semantic prompts in ROI-specific visual contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptation and Alignment Framework (HAAF). At its core is a novel Cross-Level Scaled Alignment (CLSA) mechanism that enforces a sequential calibration order: visual features first inject context into text prompts to generate content-adaptive descriptors, which then spatially guide the visual encoder to spotlight anomalies. Additionally, a dual-branch inference strategy integrates semantic scores with geometric prototypes to ensure stability in few-shot settings.

Guided by this structured and hierarchical taxonomy, we introduce a new fine-grained agentic safety benchmark (ATBench) and a Diagnostic Guardrail framework for agent safety and security (AgentDoG). AgentDoG provides fine-grained and contextual monitoring across agent trajectories. More Crucially, AgentDoG can diagnose the root causes of unsafe actions and seemingly safe but unreasonable actions, offering provenance and transparency beyond binary labels to facilitate effective agent alignment. AgentDoG variants are available in three sizes (4B, 7B, and 8B parameters) across Qwen and Llama model families.

We attribute this to two gaps: task characteristic and tool-use scaling. Medical questions require evidence interpretation in a knowledge-intensive clinical context; while general DR models can retrieve information, they often lack clinical-context reasoning and thus \"find it but fail to use it,\" leaving performance limited by medical abilities. Moreover, in medical scenarios, blindly scaling tool-call can inject noisy context, derailing sensitive medical reasoning and prompting repetitive evidence-seeking along incorrect paths. Therefore, we propose DeepMed. For data, we deploy a multi-hop med-search QA synthesis method supporting the model to apply the DR paradigm in medical contexts. For training, we introduce a difficulty-aware turn-penalty to suppress excessive tool-call growth. For inference, we bring a monitor to help validate hypotheses within a controlled number of steps and avoid context rot.

We introduce CoT-Seg, a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. Instead of fine-tuning, CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs (GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex prompts. Moreover, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask. This tight integration of reasoning and correction significantly improves reliability and robustness, especially in ambiguous or error-prone cases. Furthermore, our CoT-Seg framework allows easy incorporation of retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling the system to access external knowledge when the input lacks sufficient information.

In this work, we analyze how stabilizing training dynamics affects the induced generation distribution. We show that under standard maximum likelihood training, stable parameter trajectories lead stationary solutions to approximately minimize the forward KL divergence to the empirical distribution, while implicitly reducing generative entropy. As a consequence, the learned model can concentrate probability mass on a limited subset of empirical modes, exhibiting systematic degeneration despite smooth loss convergence. We empirically validate this effect using a controlled feedback-based training framework that stabilizes internal generation statistics, observing consistent low-entropy outputs and repetitive behavior across architectures and random seeds.

Low contrast, motion, foreshortening, overlap, and catheter confounding degrade segmentation and contribute to domain shift across centers. Reliable segmentation, together with vessel-type labeling, enables vessel-specific coronary analytics and downstream measurements that depend on anatomical localization. From 670 cine sequences (407 subjects), we select a best frame near peak opacification using a low-intensity histogram criterion and apply joint super-resolution and enhancement. We benchmark classical Meijering, Frangi, and Sato vesselness filters under per-image oracle tuning, a single global mean setting, and per-image parameter prediction via Support Vector Regression (SVR). Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015. Vessel-type labeling achieves 98.5% accuracy (Dice 0.844) for RCA, 95.4% (0.786) for LAD, and 96.2% (0.794) for LCX.

Teal Witter", "Christopher Musco"], "title": "PolySHAP: Extending KernelSHAP with Interaction-Informed Polynomial Regression", "comment": null, "summary": "Shapley values have emerged as a central game-theoretic tool in explainable AI (XAI). However, computing Shapley values exactly requires $2^d$ game evaluations for a model with $d$ features. Lundberg and Lee's KernelSHAP algorithm has emerged as a leading method for avoiding this exponential cost. KernelSHAP approximates Shapley values by approximating the game as a linear function, which is fit using a small number of game evaluations for random feature subsets.\n  In this work, we extend KernelSHAP by approximating the game via higher degree polynomials, which capture non-linear interactions between features. Our resulting PolySHAP method yields empirically better Shapley value estimates for various benchmark datasets, and we prove that these estimates are consistent.\n  Moreover, we connect our approach to paired sampling (antithetic sampling), a ubiquitous modification to KernelSHAP that improves empirical accuracy. We prove that paired sampling outputs exactly the same Shapley value approximations as second-order PolySHAP, without ever fitting a degree 2 polynomial.

We propose PhaSR (Physically Aligned Shadow Removal), addressing this through dual-level prior alignment to enable robust performance from single-light shadows to multi-source ambient lighting. First, Physically Aligned Normalization (PAN) performs closed-form illumination correction via Gray-world normalization, log-domain Retinex decomposition, and dynamic range recombination, suppressing chromatic bias. Second, Geometric-Semantic Rectification Attention (GSRA) extends differential attention to cross-modal alignment, harmonizing depth-derived geometry with DINO-v2 semantic embeddings to resolve modal conflicts under varying illumination.

While recent Transformer-based models such as Swin UNETR have achieved impressive benchmark performance, their clinical utility is often compromised by two critical issues: sensitivity to missing modalities (common in clinical practice) and a lack of confidence calibration. Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we construct a robust deterministic backbone by integrating a Zero-Init Multimodal Contextual Fusion (MMCF) module and a Residual-Gated Deep Decoder Supervision (DDS) mechanism, enabling stable feature learning and precise boundary delineation with significantly reduced Hausdorff Distance, even under modality corruption. Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

While LLMs offer potential for accessible emotional assistance, their reliability, therapeutic relevance, and alignment with human standards remain challenging to address. This paper introduces a human-grounded evaluation methodology designed to assess LLM generated responses in therapeutic dialogue. Our approach involved curating a dataset of 500 mental health conversations from datasets with real-world scenario questions and evaluating the responses generated by nine diverse LLMs, including closed source and open source models. More specifically, these responses were evaluated by two psychiatric trained experts, who independently rated each on a 5 point Likert scale across a comprehensive 6 attribute rubric. This rubric captures Cognitive Support and Affective Resonance, providing a multidimensional perspective on therapeutic quality. Our analysis reveals that LLMs provide strong cognitive reliability by producing safe, coherent, and clinically appropriate information, but they demonstrate unstable affective alignment. Although closed source models (e.g., GPT-4o) offer balanced therapeutic responses, open source models show greater variability and emotional flatness. We reveal a persistent cognitive-affective gap and highlight the need for failure aware, clinically grounded evaluation frameworks that prioritize relational sensitivity alongside informational accuracy in mental health oriented LLMs. We advocate for balanced evaluation protocols with human in the loop that center on therapeutic sensitivity and provide a framework to guide the responsible design and clinical oversight of mental health oriented conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u4f46\u60c5\u611f\u5171\u9e23\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u7cfb\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5371\u673a\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u6cbb\u7597\u7f3a\u53e3\u5927\uff0cLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u652f\u6301\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u5b58\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e869\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684500\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u540d\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u6301\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5171\u9e23\u4e0a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u5bfc\u5411\u7684LLMs\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5173\u7cfb\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u7763\u3002"}}

Effective reasoning, therefore, hinges on knowing which tools to use, when to invoke them, and how to compose them over multiple steps, even when faced with new tools or new tasks. We introduce \\textbf{AdaReasoner}, a family of multimodal models that learn tool use as a general reasoning skill rather than as tool-specific or explicitly supervised behavior. AdaReasoner is enabled by (i) a scalable data curation pipeline exposing models to long-horizon, multi-step tool interactions; (ii) Tool-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes tool selection and sequencing based on end-task success; and (iii) an adaptive learning mechanism that dynamically regulates tool usage. Together, these components allow models to infer tool utility from task context and intermediate outcomes, enabling coordination of multiple tools and generalization to unseen tools. Empirically, AdaReasoner exhibits strong tool-adaptive and generalization behaviors: it autonomously adopts beneficial tools, suppresses irrelevant ones, and adjusts tool usage frequency based on task demands, despite never being explicitly trained to do so.

While human memory naturally balances retention and forgetting through adaptive decay processes, current AI systems employ binary retention strategies that preserve everything or lose it entirely. We propose FadeMem, a biologically-inspired agent memory architecture that incorporates active forgetting mechanisms mirroring human cognitive efficiency. FadeMem implements differential decay rates across a dual-layer memory hierarchy, where retention is governed by adaptive exponential decay functions modulated by semantic relevance, access frequency, and temporal patterns. Through LLM-guided conflict resolution and intelligent memory fusion, our system consolidates related information while allowing irrelevant details to fade.

Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61\u7eb9\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08OTI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61\u7eb9\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08OTI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOTI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u8c61\u7eb9\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08OTI\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Experiments on nine LLMs show that tool augmentation generally improves emotional support quality and reduces hallucination, but the gains are strongly capacity-dependent: stronger models use tools more selectively and effectively, while weaker models benefit only marginally.

Although progress has been made in increasing the resolution of these satellite images, many downstream tasks are only interested in small regions of any given image. These areas of interest vary by task but, once known, can be used to optimize how information within the image is encoded. Whereas standard image encoding methods, even those optimized for remote sensing, work on the whole image equally, there are emerging methods that can be guided by saliency maps to focus on important areas. In this work we show how imagery preprocessing techniques driven by saliency maps can be used with traditional lossy compression coding standards to create variable rate image compression within a single large satellite image. Specifically, we use variable sized smoothing kernels that map to different quantized saliency levels to process imagery pixels in order to optimize downstream compression and encoding schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5929\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4ec5\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u57df\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u65e6\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6838\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u6e38\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u3002"}}

Across open-ended healthcare tasks, Health-SCORE achieves evaluation quality comparable to human-created rubrics while significantly lowering development effort, making rubric-based evaluation and training more scalable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Health-SCORE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u89c4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u91cf\u89c4\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Health-SCORE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "Health-SCORE\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u578b\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u521b\u5efa\u91cf\u89c4\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Health-SCORE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u89c4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work augments LLMs with external tools to enable agentic reasoning, achieving high utility and efficiency in a plug-and-play manner. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of such methods to malicious manipulation of the tool-calling process remain largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity.

In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote targeted degradation of Abeta-42 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), using E3 ligase-directed molecular glues. We systematically evaluated the ternary complex formation potential of Abeta-42 with three E3 ligases: CRBN, VHL, and MDM2, through structure-based modeling, ADMET screening, and docking. We then developed a Ligase-Conditioned Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (LC-JT-VAE) to generate ligase-specific small molecules, incorporating protein sequence embeddings and torsional angle-aware molecular graphs. Our results demonstrate that this generative model can produce chemically valid, novel, and target-specific molecular glues capable of facilitating Abeta-42 degradation.

To address these limitations, we propose Stylizing ViT, a novel Vision Transformer encoder that utilizes weight-shared attention blocks for both self- and cross-attention. This design allows the same attention block to maintain anatomical consistency through self-attention while performing style transfer via cross-attention. We assess the effectiveness of our method for domain generalization by employing it for data augmentation on three distinct image classification tasks in the context of histopathology and dermatology. Results demonstrate an improved robustness (up to +13% accuracy) over the state of the art while generating perceptually convincing images without artifacts.

Trading Visual Uncertainties in Multi-Agent Bandit Systems", "comment": "Accepted to ICLR 2026", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multi-agent systems, but scaling them is economically unsustainable: coordinating heterogeneous agents under information asymmetry often spirals costs. Existing paradigms, such as Mixture-of-Agents and knowledge-based routers, rely on heuristic proxies that ignore costs and collapse uncertainty structure, leading to provably suboptimal coordination. We introduce Agora, a framework that reframes coordination as a decentralized market for uncertainty. Agora formalizes epistemic uncertainty into a structured, tradable asset (perceptual, semantic, inferential), and enforces profitability-driven trading among agents based on rational economic rules. A market-aware broker, extending Thompson Sampling, initiates collaboration and guides the system toward cost-efficient equilibria. Experiments on five multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MMBench, MathVision, InfoVQA, CC-OCR) show that Agora outperforms strong VLMs and heuristic multi-agent strategies, e.g., achieving +8.5% accuracy over the best baseline on MMMU while reducing cost by over 3x.

Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models.

Through extensive experiments, we evaluated over 30 leading proprietary and open-source LLMs, VLMs, and TSLLMs within TSRBench. Our findings reveal that: i) scaling laws hold for perception and reasoning but break down for prediction; ii) strong reasoning does not guarantee accurate context-aware forecasting, indicating a decoupling between semantic understanding and numerical prediction; and iii) despite the complementary nature of textual and visual represenations of time series as inputs, current multimodal models fail to effectively fuse them for reciprocal performance gains.

Specifically, we first introduce explicit Spatial-Layout Planning to transform textual instructions into spatial layout plans, decoupling geometric planning from visual synthesis.

Here, we present an automated deep learning framework that integrates AI-assisted annotation, segmentation, classification, and instance counting to quantify red blood cell (RBC) populations across varying density regimes in time-lapse microscopy data. Experimental images were annotated using the Roboflow platform to generate labeled dataset for training an nnU-Net segmentation model. The trained network enables prediction of the temporal evolution of the sickle cell fraction, while a watershed algorithm resolves overlapping cells to enhance quantification accuracy. Despite requiring only a limited amount of labeled data for training, the framework achieves high segmentation performance, effectively addressing challenges associated with scarce manual annotations and cell overlap. By quantitatively tracking dynamic changes in RBC morphology, this approach can more than double the experimental throughput via densely packed cell suspensions, capture drug-dependent sickling behavior, and reveal distinct mechanobiological signatures of cellular morphological evolution.

Sparse-voxel rasterization provides continuous opacity fields and crisp geometry, but its typical uniform dense-grid initialization slows convergence and underutilizes scene structure. We combine the advantages of both by introducing a voxel initialization method that places voxels at plausible locations and with appropriate levels of detail, yielding a strong starting point for per-scene optimization.

To date, no empirical study has systematically examined the effectiveness of existing methods, nor investigated the effects of different training recipes, such as scaling laws, objective design, and optimization strategies. A rigorous empirical analysis is essential not only for benchmarking performance and revealing true gains but also for establishing the current state of ASSR, identifying saturation limits, and highlighting promising directions. We fill this gap by comparing existing techniques across diverse settings and presenting aggregated performance results on multiple image quality metrics. We contribute a unified framework and code repository to facilitate reproducible comparisons. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of carefully controlled training configurations on perceptual image quality and examine a new loss function that penalizes intensity variations while preserving edges, textures, and finer details during training. We conclude the following key insights that have been previously overlooked: (1) Recent, more complex INR methods provide only marginal improvements over earlier methods.

However, these models struggle to generate long-form, coherent narratives from high-level concepts like dialogue, revealing a ``semantic gap'' between a creative idea and its cinematic execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel, end-to-end agentic framework for dialogue-to-cinematic-video generation. Central to our framework is ScripterAgent, a model trained to translate coarse dialogue into a fine-grained, executable cinematic script. To enable this, we construct ScriptBench, a new large-scale benchmark with rich multimodal context, annotated via an expert-guided pipeline. The generated script then guides DirectorAgent, which orchestrates state-of-the-art video models using a cross-scene continuous generation strategy to ensure long-horizon coherence. Our comprehensive evaluation, featuring an AI-powered CriticAgent and a new Visual-Script Alignment (VSA) metric, shows our framework significantly improves script faithfulness and temporal fidelity across all tested video models.

In real-world scenarios, Pixel-level change labels are expensive to acquire, and existing models struggle to adapt to scenarios with diverse annotation availability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified change detection framework (UniCD), which collaboratively handles supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised tasks through a coupled architecture. UniCD eliminates architectural barriers through a shared encoder and multi-branch collaborative learning mechanism, achieving deep coupling of heterogeneous supervision signals. Specifically, UniCD consists of three supervision-specific branches. In the supervision branch, UniCD introduces the spatial-temporal awareness module (STAM), achieving efficient synergistic fusion of bi-temporal features. In the weakly-supervised branch, we construct change representation regularization (CRR), which steers model convergence from coarse-grained activations toward coherent and separable change modeling.

To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption.

However, shape extraction from Gaussian primitives remains an open problem. Due to inadequate geometry parameterization and approximation, existing shape reconstruction methods suffer from poor multi-view consistency and are sensitive to floaters. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical derivation that establishes Gaussian primitives as a specific type of stochastic solids.

Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynMind\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3afMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709fMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\u6216\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eVLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08Stable Diffusion 1.4\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSynMind\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "SynMind\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u8111\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "SynMind\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86fMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling. In addition, a test-time adaptation strategy is employed during inference to further alleviate distribution shifts. Experiments on simulated multi-center medical imaging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models without domain generalization or quantum enhancement on unseen domains, achieving reduced domain-specific performance variance and improved AUC and sensitivity.

Recent advances, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have extended this paradigm to videos and multi-view images.

In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings. Trained on the SA-1B dataset, our method generalizes well across domains, outperforming SAM2-Video and achieving comparable performance with per-scene optimization baselines on NVOS, SPIn-NeRF, ScanNet++, uCo3D, and DL3DV benchmarks.

In this paper, we revisit 3D reconstruction from the perspective of signal processing, identifying the periodic spectral extension induced by discrete sampling as the fundamental challenge. Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our Jinc and modulated kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51faJinc\u6838\u53ca\u8c03\u5236\u6838\uff0c\u4f18\u53163D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9891\u57df\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9891\u8c31\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4f20\u7edf\u91cd\u5efa\u6838\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u65af\u3001\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u4f4e\u901a\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u6df7\u53e0\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c63D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u63d0\u51faJinc\u6838\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u60f3\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8c03\u5236\u6838\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7a7a\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Jinc\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u6838\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Jinc\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u6838\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9891\u57df\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We focus on the challenging FSCIL setup where a model receives only a single sample (1-shot) for each novel class and no further training or model alterations are allowed after the base training phase. This makes generalization to novel classes particularly difficult. We propose a novel approach predicated on the hypothesis that base and novel class embeddings have structural similarity. We map the original embedding space into a residual space by subtracting the class prototype (i.e., the average class embedding) of input samples. Then, we leverage generative modeling with VAE or diffusion models to learn the multi-modal distribution of residuals over the base classes, and we use this as a valuable structural prior to improve recognition of novel classes.

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a potent framework for refining model responses, its efficacy in high-stakes medical contexts remains underexplored, lacking the rigorous empirical groundwork necessary to guide future methodological advances. To bridge this gap, we present the first comprehensive examination of diverse DPO variants within the medical domain, evaluating nine distinct formulations across two medical LVLMs: LLaVA-Med and HuatuoGPT-Vision. Our results reveal several critical limitations: current DPO approaches often yield inconsistent gains over supervised fine-tuning, with their efficacy varying significantly across different tasks and backbones. Furthermore, they frequently fail to resolve fundamental visual misinterpretation errors. Building on these insights, we present a targeted preference construction strategy as a proof-of-concept that explicitly addresses visual misinterpretation errors frequently observed in existing DPO models. This design yields a 3.6% improvement over the strongest existing DPO baseline on visual question-answering tasks.

Davison"], "title": "RemEdit: Efficient Diffusion Editing with Riemannian Geometry", "comment": null, "summary": "Controllable image generation is fundamental to the success of modern generative AI, yet it faces a critical trade-off between semantic fidelity and inference speed. The RemEdit diffusion-based framework addresses this trade-off with two synergistic innovations. First, for editing fidelity, we navigate the latent space as a Riemannian manifold. A mamba-based module efficiently learns the manifold's structure, enabling direct and accurate geodesic path computation for smooth semantic edits. This control is further refined by a dual-SLERP blending technique and a goal-aware prompt enrichment pass from a Vision-Language Model. Second, for additional acceleration, we introduce a novel task-specific attention pruning mechanism. A lightweight pruning head learns to retain tokens essential to the edit, enabling effective optimization without the semantic degradation common in content-agnostic approaches. RemEdit surpasses prior state-of-the-art editing frameworks while maintaining real-time performance under 50% pruning. Consequently, RemEdit establishes a new benchmark for practical and powerful image editing.

This reciprocal guidance forms a bidirectional co-training loop that allows both models to effectively exploit the unlabeled data.

Conventional upsampling methods, such as transposed convolution and linear interpolation, operate on fixed positions: transposed convolution applies kernel elements to predetermined pixel or voxel locations, while linear interpolation assigns values based on fixed coordinates in the original feature map. These fixed-position approaches may fail to capture structural information beyond predefined sampling positions and can lead to artifacts or loss of detail. Inspired by deformable convolutions, we propose a novel upsampling method, Deformable Transposed Convolution (DTC), which learns dynamic coordinates (i.e., sampling positions) to generate high-resolution feature maps for both 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

However, existing pipelines rely on supervised segmentation or hand-crafted kymographs and rarely encode the laminar Stokes-flow physics that governs RBC shape evolution. We introduce FlowMorph, a physics-consistent self-supervised framework that learns a label-free scalar mechanics proxy $k$ for each tracked RBC from short brightfield microfluidic videos. FlowMorph models each cell by a low-dimensional parametric contour, advances boundary points through a differentiable ''capsule-in-flow'' combining laminar advection and curvature-regularized elastic relaxation, and optimizes a loss coupling silhouette overlap, intra-cellular flow agreement, area conservation, wall constraints, and temporal smoothness, using only automatically derived silhouettes and optical flow.\n  Across four public RBC microfluidic datasets, FlowMorph achieves a mean silhouette IoU of $0.905$ on physics-rich videos with provided velocity fields and markedly improves area conservation and wall violations over purely data-driven baselines. On $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^5$ centered sequences, the scalar $k$ alone separates tank-treading from flipping dynamics with an AUC of $0.863$. Using only $200$ real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) events for calibration, a monotone map $E=g(k)$ predicts apparent Young's modulus with a mean absolute error of $0.118$\\,MPa on $600$ held-out cells and degrades gracefully under shifts in channel geometry, optics, and frame rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowMorph \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\u6807\u91cfk\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d8\u5f62\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u8840\u6db2\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u5272\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684kymographs\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u7f16\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u72b6\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5c42\u6d41\u65af\u6258\u514b\u65af\u6d41\u7269\u7406\u3002", "method": "FlowMorph \u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6d41\u5e73\u6d41\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f39\u6027\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u201c\u80f6\u56ca\u6d41\u52a8\u201d\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u635f\u5931\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlowMorph \u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u8f6e\u5ed3IoU\u4e3a0.905\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9762\u79ef\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u58c1\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6807\u91cfk\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5AUC 0.863\u533a\u5206\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u5766\u514b\u5c65\u5e26\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMorph \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u77ed\u65f6\u660e\u573a\u5fae\u6d41\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u4ee3\u7406\u6807\u91cfk\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u53d8\u5f62\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling.

Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation.

Multispectral modalities (visible light and thermal) can boost pedestrian detection performance by providing complementary visual information. Several gaps remain with multispectral pedestrian detection methods. First, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial fusion and often neglect temporal information. Second, RGB and thermal image pairs in multispectral benchmarks may not always be perfectly aligned. Pedestrians are also challenging to detect due to varying lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. This work proposes Strip-Fusion, a spatial-temporal fusion network that is robust to misalignment in input images, as well as varying lighting conditions and heavy occlusions. The Strip-Fusion pipeline integrates temporally adaptive convolutions to dynamically weigh spatial-temporal features, enabling our model to better capture pedestrian motion and context over time. A novel Kullback-Leibler divergence loss was designed to mitigate modality imbalance between visible and thermal inputs, guiding feature alignment toward the more informative modality during training. Furthermore, a novel post-processing algorithm was developed to reduce false positives.

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u80ba\u764c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u75c7\u72b6\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u547c\u5438\u7cfb\u7edf\u75be\u75c5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u89e3\u7f20\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "LungCRCT\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523093.91%\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "LungCRCT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u80ba\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693.91%\u7684AUC\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u3002"}}

The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains.

However, most existing methods rely on reactive state-action mappings without explicitly modeling how actions causally transform subsequent visual observations. Lacking such vision-action causality, agents cannot anticipate the visual changes induced by its own actions, leading to unstable behaviors, weak generalization, and cumulative error along trajectory. To address these issues, we introduce \\textsc{NaVIDA} (\\textbf{Nav}igation with \\textbf{I}nverse \\textbf{D}ynamics \\textbf{A}ugmentation), a unified VLN framework that couples policy learning with action-grounded visual dynamics and adaptive execution. \\textsc{NaVIDA} augments training with chunk-based inverse-dynamics supervision to learn causal relationship between visual changes and corresponding actions. To structure this supervision and extend the effective planning range, \\textsc{NaVIDA} employs hierarchical probabilistic action chunking (HPAC), which organizes trajectories into multi-step chunks and provides discriminative, longer-range visual-change cues. To further curb error accumulation and stabilize behavior at inference, an entropy-guided mechanism adaptively sets the execution horizon of action chunks.

Existing methods, however, still rely on source domain annotations and are susceptible to distribution shifts, leading to degraded generalization performance in the target domain. To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions.

However, the shrinking operation loses the visual features of text margins and confuses the foreground and background difference, which brings intrinsic limitations to recognize text features. We follow this issue and design Text-Pass Filter (TPF) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. It segments the whole text directly, which avoids the intrinsic limitations. It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. It provides a natural idea for extracting whole texts separately. By simulating the band-pass filter, TPF constructs a unique feature-filter pair for each text. In the inference stage, every filter extracts the corresponding matched text by passing its pass-feature and blocking other features. Meanwhile, considering the large aspect ratio problem of ribbon-like texts makes it hard to recognize texts wholly, a Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU) is designed to enhance the feature consistency of the same text and to enlarge the filter's recognition field to help recognize whole texts. Furthermore, a Foreground Prior Unit (FPU) is introduced to encourage TPF to discriminate the difference between the foreground and background, which improves the feature-filter pair quality.

Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle.

However, most existing VAD methods rely on large-scale models to pursue extreme accuracy, limiting their feasibility on resource-limited edge devices. Moreover, mainstream prediction-based VAD detects anomalies using only single-frame future prediction errors, overlooking the richer constraints from longer-term temporal forward information. In this paper, we introduce FoGA, a lightweight VAD model that performs Forward consistency learning with Gated context Aggregation, containing about 2M parameters and tailored for potential edge devices. Specifically, we propose a Unet-based method that performs feature extraction on consecutive frames to generate both immediate and forward predictions. Then, we introduce a gated context aggregation module into the skip connections to dynamically fuse encoder and decoder features at the same spatial scale. Finally, the model is jointly optimized with a novel forward consistency loss, and a hybrid anomaly measurement strategy is adopted to integrate errors from both immediate and forward frames for more accurate detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods, running up to 155 FPS.

Accurate and robust 2D-3D vessel registration is essential to guide microcatheter and instruments during TACE, enabling precise localization of vascular structures and optimal therapeutic targeting. To tackle this issue, we develop a coarse-to-fine registration strategy. First, we introduce a global alignment module, structure-aware perspective n-point (SA-PnP), to establish correspondence between 2D and 3D vessel structures. Second, we propose TempDiffReg, a temporal diffusion model that performs vessel deformation iteratively by leveraging temporal context to capture complex anatomical variations and local structural changes. We collected data from 23 patients and constructed 626 paired multi-frame samples for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both accuracy and anatomical plausibility. Specifically, our method achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.63 mm and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 mm in registration accuracy, representing 66.7\\% lower MSE and 17.7\\% lower MAE compared to the most competitive existing approaches. It has the potential to assist less-experienced clinicians in safely and efficiently performing complex TACE procedures, ultimately enhancing both surgical outcomes and patient care.

Building upon the DSO, we design two lightweight gating modules: the Dual-Statistic Synergy Gating (DSG) module for adaptive channel-wise feature selection, and the Multi-Path Segmented Gating (MSG) module for depth-wise feature weighting. On the MS-COCO benchmark, YOLO-DS consistently outperforms YOLOv8 across five model scales (N, S, M, L, X), achieving AP gains of 1.1% to 1.7% with only a minimal increase in inference latency.

Code: https://github.com/Lcrucial1f/MPS-CLIP", "summary": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models like CLIP have significantly advanced Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR). However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods.

However, EEG-to-video reconstruction remains challenging due to: 1) Single Modality: existing studies solely align EEG signals with the text modality, which ignores other modalities and are prone to suffer from overfitting problems; 2) Data Scarcity: current methods often have difficulty training to converge with limited EEG-video data. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel framework MindCine to achieve high-fidelity video reconstructions on limited data. We employ a multimodal joint learning strategy to incorporate beyond-text modalities in the training stage and leverage a pre-trained large EEG model to relieve the data scarcity issue for decoding semantic information, while a Seq2Seq model with causal attention is specifically designed for decoding perceptual information.

Remarkable progresses have been achieved while the existing methods typically treat it as a direct regression or iterative refinement problem and often struggling to capture complex geometric transformations or generalize across different domains. In this work, we propose HomoFM, a new framework that introduces the flow matching technique from generative modeling into the homography estimation task for the first time. Unlike the existing methods, we formulate homography estimation problem as a velocity field learning problem. By modeling a continuous and point-wise velocity field that transforms noisy distributions into registered coordinates, the proposed network recovers high-precision transformations through a conditional flow trajectory. Furthermore, to address the challenge of domain shifts issue, e.g., the cases of multimodal matching or varying illumination scenarios, we integrate a gradient reversal layer (GRL) into the feature extraction backbone. This domain adaptation strategy explicitly constrains the encoder to learn domain-invariant representations, significantly enhancing the network's robustness.

However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair.

However, a major challenge in this projection is the many-to-one conflict, where multiple 3D points are mapped onto the same pixel in the range image, requiring a selection strategy. Existing approaches typically retain the point with the smallest depth (closest to the LiDAR), disregarding semantic relevance and object structure, which leads to the loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we extend the depth-based selection rule by incorporating contextual information from both instance centers and class labels, introducing two mechanisms: \\textit{Centerness-Aware Projection (CAP)} and \\textit{Class-Weighted-Aware Projection (CWAP)}. In CAP, point depths are adjusted according to their distance from the instance center, thereby prioritizing central instance points over noisy boundary and background points. In CWAP, object classes are prioritized through user-defined weights, offering flexibility in the projection strategy. Our evaluations on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that CAP preserves more instance points during projection, achieving up to a 3.1\\% mIoU improvement compared to the baseline.

To address this limitation, we decompose human swipe gestures into multiple quantifiable dimensions and propose an automated pipeline SwipeGen to synthesize human-like swipe interactions through GUI exploration.

Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension).

The system integrates three components -- slice classification, inner ear localization, and sequence-specific segmentation -- into a single workflow that computes per-ear endolymphatic-to-vestibular volume ratios (ELR) directly from whole MRI volumes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n  Trained with only 3 to 6 annotated slices per patient, OREHAS generalized effectively to full 3D volumes, achieving Dice scores of 0.90 for SPACE-MRC and 0.75 for REAL-IR. In an external validation cohort with complete manual annotations, OREHAS closely matched expert ground truth (VSI = 74.3%) and substantially outperformed the clinical syngo.via software (VSI = 42.5%), which tended to overestimate endolymphatic volumes. Across 19 test patients, vestibular measurements from OREHAS were consistent with syngo.via, while endolymphatic volumes were systematically smaller and more physiologically realistic.\n  These results show that reliable and reproducible EH quantification can be achieved from standard MRI using limited supervision. By combining efficient deep-learning-based segmentation with a clinically aligned volumetric workflow, OREHAS reduces operator dependence, ensures methodological consistency.

However, direct eye tracking is often unavailable due to hardware limitations or privacy concerns. To address this, we present a novel gaze prediction framework that combines Head-Mounted Display (HMD) motion signals with visual saliency cues derived from video frames. Our method employs UniSal, a lightweight saliency encoder, to extract visual features, which are then fused with HMD motion data and processed through a time-series prediction module.

Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Radon\u53d8\u6362\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u88c1\u526a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u5370\u540c\u6b65\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u503c\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Radon\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5931\u771f\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u548c\u590d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u88c1\u526a\u540e\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access. Building on these principles, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes algorithms with intrinsic knowledge of their optimal streaming and memory use; the DSL performs compile-time and run-time pipeline analyses to automatically select window sizes, fuse stages, tee and zip streams, and schedule passes for limited-RAM machines, yielding near-linear I/O scans and predictable memory footprints. The approach integrates with existing tooling for segmentation and morphology but reframes pre/post-processing as pipelines that privilege sequential read/write patterns, delivering substantial throughput gains for extremely large images without requiring full-volume residency in memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548cDSL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684I/O\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff08\u59821.4 PB\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6570\u636e\u6216150 TB\u4eba\u4f53\u5668\u5b98\u56fe\u8c31\uff09\u4e2dI/O\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u626b\u63a0\u6267\u884c\u3001\u7a97\u53e3\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5757\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u548cDSL\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684I/O\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff08DSL\uff09\u548c\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684I/O\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u3002"}}

Standard practice aligns all specimens via Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) prior to splitting data into training and test sets, potentially introducing statistical dependence and contaminating downstream predictive models. Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust \"diagonal\" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space. The importance of spatial autocorrelation among landmarks is further demonstrated using linear and convolutional regression models, highlighting performance degradation when landmark relationships are ignored.

Active learning (AL) alleviates this burden by prioritizing informative samples for annotation, typically through a diversity-based cold-start phase followed by uncertainty-driven selection. We propose a novel cold-start sampling strategy that combines foundation-model embeddings with clustering, including automatic selection of the number of clusters and proportional sampling across clusters, to construct a diverse and representative initial training. This is followed by an uncertainty-based AL framework that integrates spatial diversity to guide sample selection. The proposed method is intuitive and interpretable, enabling visualization of the feature-space distribution of candidate samples. We evaluate our approach on three datasets spanning X-ray and MRI modalities. On the CheXmask dataset, the cold-start strategy outperforms random selection, improving Dice from 0.918 to 0.929 and reducing the Hausdorff distance from 32.41 to 27.66 mm. In the AL setting, combined entropy and diversity selection improves Dice from 0.919 to 0.939 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 30.10 to 19.16 mm. On the Montgomery dataset, cold-start gains are substantial, with Dice improving from 0.928 to 0.950 and Hausdorff distance decreasing from 14.22 to 9.38 mm. On the SynthStrip dataset, cold-start selection slightly affects Dice but reduces the Hausdorff distance from 9.43 to 8.69 mm, while active learning improves Dice from 0.816 to 0.826 and reduces the Hausdorff distance from 7.76 to 6.38 mm.

Unlike unified models that face expensive training costs and understanding-generation trade-offs, GenAgent decouples these capabilities through an agentic framework: understanding is handled by the multimodal model itself, while generation is achieved by treating image generation models as invokable tools. Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration. GenAgent significantly boosts base generator(FLUX.1-dev) performance on GenEval++ (+23.6\\%) and WISE (+14\\%). Beyond performance gains, our framework demonstrates three key properties: 1) cross-tool generalization to generators with varying capabilities, 2) test-time scaling with consistent improvements across interaction rounds, and 3) task-adaptive reasoning that automatically adjusts to different tasks.

Although the existing learned compression methods have achieved promising results for natural images from earth, there remain two critical issues that hinder their effectiveness for Martian image compression: 1) They overlook the highly-limited computational resources on Mars; 2) They do not utilize the strong \\textit{inter-image} similarities across Martian images to advance image compression performance. Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \\textit{intra-} and \\textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance. To leverage \\textit{inter-image} similarities, we propose a reference-guided entropy module and a ref-decoder that utilize useful information from reference images, reducing redundant operations at the encoder and achieving superior compression performance. To exploit \\textit{intra-image} similarities, the ref-decoder adopts a deep, multi-scale architecture with enlarged receptive field size to model long-range spatial dependencies. Additionally, we develop a latent feature recycling mechanism to further alleviate the extreme computational constraints on Mars.

In particular, FemoroAcetabular Impingement (FAI) screening relies on angles traditionally measured on X-rays. However, assessing the height and span of the impingement area requires also a 3D view through an MRI scan. The two modalities inform the surgeon on different aspects of the condition. In this work, we conduct a matched-cohort validation study (89 patients, paired MRI/X-ray) using standard heatmap regression architectures to assess cross-modality clinical equivalence. Seen that landmark detection has been proven effective on X-rays, we show that MRI also achieves equivalent localisation and diagnostic accuracy for cam-type impingement. Our method demonstrates clinical feasibility for FAI assessment in coronal views of 3D MRI volumes, opening the possibility for volumetric analysis through placing further landmarks.

However, real-world medical datasets frequently exhibit severe class imbalance, where positive samples substantially outnumber negative samples, leading to biased models with low recall rates for minority classes. This imbalance not only compromises diagnostic accuracy but also poses clinical misdiagnosis risks. To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space.

However, the transmission speed of the satellite downlink has become a major bottleneck in certain applications, such as disaster monitoring and emergency mapping, which demand a fast response ability. We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making. To accommodate the resource constraints of satellite platforms, the proposed method adopts a lightweight, non-deep learning framework integrated with a few-shot learning strategy. Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations. Furthermore, we developed a rank constraint-based graph clustering algorithm to determine the anchor labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7AI\u536b\u661f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u536b\u661f\u5728\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u6d4b\u7ed8\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u4e0b\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u975e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u79e9\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u536b\u661f\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u4e0b\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u901f\u5ea6\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u536b\u661f\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Furthermore, a Fine-grained Feature Retention (FFR) strategy is adopted to incorporate spatially rich shallow features during fusion to preserve fine-grained details, crucial for small object detection in UAV imagery. Extensive experiments on VisDrone and CODrone benchmarks demonstrate that our EFSI-DETR achieves the state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency, yielding improvement of \\textbf{1.6}\\% and \\textbf{5.8}\\% in AP and AP$_{s}$ on VisDrone, while obtaining \\textbf{188} FPS inference speed on a single RTX 4090 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "EFSI-DETR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u7387-\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6709\u9650\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5377\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "EFSI-DETR\u5305\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u7387-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DyFusNet\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u4e2d\u5668\uff08ESFC\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u7559\u7b56\u7565\uff08FFR\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728VisDrone\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAP\u548cAPs\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.6%\u548c5.8%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230188 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "EFSI-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u7387-\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u5728VisDrone\u548cCODrone\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

In segmentation, existing pipelines are typically tuned to large, homogeneous regions, but their performance drops when objects are small, sparse, or locally irregular. In this work, we propose a scale-aware SSL adaptation that integrates small-window cropping into the augmentation pipeline, zooming in on fine-scale structures during pretraining. We evaluate this approach across two domains with markedly different data modalities: seismic imaging, where the goal is to segment sparse faults, and neuroimaging, where the task is to delineate small cellular structures. In both settings, our method yields consistent improvements over standard and state-of-the-art baselines under label constraints, improving accuracy by up to 13% for fault segmentation and 5% for cell delineation. In contrast, large-scale features such as seismic facies or tissue regions see little benefit, underscoring that the value of SSL depends critically on the scale of the target objects.

Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency.

Previous 3D talking head generation methods have relied on domain-specific heuristics such as warping-based facial motion representation priors to animate talking motions, yet still produce inaccurate 3D avatar reconstructions, thus undermining the realism of generated animations. We introduce Splat-Portrait, a Gaussian-splatting-based method that addresses the challenges of 3D head reconstruction and lip motion synthesis. Our approach automatically learns to disentangle a single portrait image into a static 3D reconstruction represented as static Gaussian Splatting, and a predicted whole-image 2D background. It then generates natural lip motion conditioned on input audio, without any motion driven priors. Training is driven purely by 2D reconstruction and score-distillation losses, without 3D supervision nor landmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Splat-Portrait exhibits superior performance on talking head generation and novel view synthesis, achieving better visual quality compared to previous works.

An Attraction-Centric Evaluation of Global Visual Knowledge", "comment": "Work in progress", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced visually compelling results, yet it remains unclear whether these models encode geographically equitable visual knowledge. In this work, we investigate the geo-equity and geographically grounded visual knowledge of text-to-video models through an attraction-centric evaluation. We introduce Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP), a systematic framework for assessing how faithfully models synthesize tourist attractions from diverse regions, and construct GEOATTRACTION-500, a benchmark of 500 globally distributed attractions spanning varied regions and popularity levels. GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578bSora 2\u5728\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u5730\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u5907\u5168\u7403\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u5730\u7406\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ca\u5730\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Geo-Attraction Landmark Probing (GAP)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u7403\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86GEOATTRACTION-500\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Sora 2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u57df\u3001\u53d1\u5c55\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5730\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f31\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u666f\u70b9\u77e5\u540d\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Sora 2\uff09\u5728\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5730\u7406\u504f\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
