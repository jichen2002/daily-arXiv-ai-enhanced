We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\u03c7$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $\u03b4_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\\varepsilon_n,\u03b4_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.", "AI": {"conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6d17\u724c\u6307\u6570$\u03c7$\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d17\u724c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u7684$(\\varepsilon_n,\u03b4_n)$-DP\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7FFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86Balle\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6bef\u754c\uff08\u6bef\u6563\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5c40\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7eaf\u5c40\u90e8DP\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u5927\u591a\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u53c2\u6570$\\varepsilon_0$\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u8c03\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e0a\u754c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bbd\u677e\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u8868\u5f81\u6d17\u724c\u5982\u4f55\u653e\u5927\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6bef\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u91cf\u53c2\u6570$\u03c7$\uff08\u6d17\u724c\u6307\u6570\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6d17\u724c\u6307\u6570\u548c\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d17\u724c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\u7684DP\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bef\u6563\u5ea6\u7684FFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\\.

It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $\u0398(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7$k$-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e$\u0398(k)$\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7269\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u8239\u5382\uff09\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b\u7684\u96f6\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728$k$-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5747\u5300\u5c3a\u5bf8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651$k$-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86$\u0398(k)$\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6392\u5217\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d85\u51fa$k$\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e$k$\u503c\u9ad8\u8fbe\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e$k$\u503c\u9ad8\u8fbe\u5168\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9$k$-\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e$\u0398(k)$\u7f51\u683c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u5145\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d85\u51fa$k$\u7684\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

The framework integrates multi-layer Walker Delta constellations, a parametric mobility model for user distributions across Canadian land regions, adaptive K-Means clustering for beamforming and user association, and Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning. Simulation results with 500 users show that FTA-NTN achieves over 9.88 Gbps of aggregate throughput with an average fairness of 0.42, corresponding to an optimal configuration of 9 planes with 15 satellites per plane in LEO and 7 planes with 3 satellites per plane in MEO. These values align with 3GPP NTN evaluation scenarios and representative system assumptions, confirming their relevance for realistic deployments.

Preprint of an accepted paper at IEEE BigData 2025 (main track). Source code for the introduced methods and framework available at https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-toolkit", "summary": "LLM-based agents are rapidly being adopted across diverse domains. Since they interact with users without supervision, they must be tested extensively. Current testing approaches focus on acceptance-level evaluation from the user's perspective. While intuitive, these tests require manual evaluation, are difficult to automate, do not facilitate root cause analysis, and incur expensive test environments. In this paper, we present methods to enable structural testing of LLM-based agents. Our approach utilizes traces (based on OpenTelemetry) to capture agent trajectories, employs mocking to enforce reproducible LLM behavior, and adds assertions to automate test verification. This enables testing agent components and interactions at a deeper technical level within automated workflows. We demonstrate how structural testing enables the adaptation of software engineering best practices to agents, including the test automation pyramid, regression testing, test-driven development, and multi-language testing.

This study introduces an empirical learning framework that derives these trade-offs directly from naturalistic trajectory data. A unified objective space represents each AV timestep through composite scores of safety, efficiency, and interaction. Pareto dominance is applied to identify non-dominated states, forming an empirical frontier that defines the attainable region of balanced performance.\n  The proposed framework was demonstrated using the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) datasets from Foggy Bottom and I-395. Results showed that only 0.23\\% of AV driving instances were Pareto-optimal, underscoring the rarity of simultaneous optimization across objectives. Pareto-optimal states showed notably higher mean scores for safety, efficiency, and interaction compared to non-optimal cases, with interaction showing the greatest potential for improvement.\n  This minimally invasive and modular framework, which requires only kinematic and positional data, can be directly applied beyond the scope of this study to derive and visualize multi-objective learning surfaces", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5206\u6570\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u652f\u914d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b9e\u8bc1\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u67090.23%\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u6570\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u652f\u914d\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u6781\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples.

Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684BPM\u65b0\u6d6a\u6f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684A-BPMS\u67b6\u6784\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0cBPM\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u7ecf\u5386\u4ece\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5230\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6d6a\u6f6e\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e2025\u5e74AI for BPM\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u4e0a\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u6f14\u8bb2\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6d41\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u4f1a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86A-BPMS\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u4eba\u5de5\u9a71\u52a8\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS)\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

These false alarms demand substantial manual inspection, creating severe inefficiencies in industrial code review. While recent work has demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) for false alarm reduction on open-source benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world enterprise settings remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of diverse LLM-based false alarm reduction techniques in an industrial context at Tencent, one of the largest IT companies in China. Using data from Tencent's enterprise-customized SAT on its large-scale Advertising and Marketing Services software, we construct a dataset of 433 alarms (328 false positives, 105 true positives) covering three common bug types. Through interviewing developers and analyzing the data, our results highlight the prevalence of false positives, which wastes substantial manual effort (e.g., 10-20 minutes of manual inspection per alarm). Meanwhile, our results show the huge potential of LLMs for reducing false alarms in industrial settings (e.g., hybrid techniques of LLM and static analysis eliminate 94-98% of false positives with high recall). Furthermore, LLM-based techniques are cost-effective, with per-alarm costs as low as 2.1-109.5 seconds and $0.0011-$0.12, representing orders-of-magnitude savings compared to manual review.

Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning.

Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits.

However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased \u03b1-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming.

We identify resource contention at the RAN and the edge server as the root cause, compounded by SLO-unaware schedulers. Existing SLO-aware approaches require RAN--edge coordination, making them impractical for deployment and prone to poor performance due to coordination delays, limited heterogeneous application support, and ignoring edge resource contention. This paper introduces SMEC, a practical, SLO-aware resource management framework that facilitates deadline-aware scheduling through fully decoupled operations at the RAN and edge servers. Our key insight is that standard 5G protocols and application behaviors naturally provide information exploitable for SLO-aware management without extensive infrastructure or application changes. Evaluation on our 5G MEC testbed shows that SMEC achieves 90-96% SLO satisfaction versus under 6% for existing approaches, while reducing tail latency by up to 122$\\times$.

Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort.\n  We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination.

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details.

However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods.

However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%).

Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86RIFT\uff08\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u7684Jeopardy!\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u572810,000\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8df3\u8dc3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe72%\uff0c50%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u987a\u5e8f\u8fdd\u53cd\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u975e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations.

Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task.

While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process. This rich set of statistics is later used to synthesize a signal that is added to the initial rendering, boosting its perceived quality. We focus on phase information, demonstrating the importance of its alignment across space and frequencies. We calibrate and compare our method with state-of-the-art strategies, showing a significant reduction in the content that must be accurately rendered at a relatively small extra cost for synthesizing the additional signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7cbe\u786e\u6e32\u67d3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b0\u578b\u663e\u793a\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6e32\u67d3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4eba\u773c\u5728\u5468\u8fb9\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51f9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u5408\u6210\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u5408\u6210\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity. These findings demonstrate the potential of QA to enable fast and robust topology control for next-generation UAV communication networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u94fe\u8def\u8d28\u91cf\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u4ea4\u6362\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5019\u9009\u62d3\u6251\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ecf\u5178\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u4e00\u9759\u6001\u6700\u4f18\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u572830\u79d2\u52a8\u6001\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u53476.6%\uff1b\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u503c5.15%\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u6837\u602728.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPython\u5316\u7684PIMPL\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u516c\u5171API\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684Python\u5e93\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Python\u5e93\u5728\u957f\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u96be\u4ee5\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91caC++\u7684PIMPL\u60ef\u7528\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPython\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u59d4\u6258\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u95f4\u63a5\u3001\u95e8\u9762\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u540e\u7aef\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728Python\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Pythonic PIMPL\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9694\u79bb\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u5165\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u516c\u5171API\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdPython\u5316\u7684PIMPL\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u5171API\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization", "summary": "Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification.

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001RGB\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u590d\u67423D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u901a\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u6709\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u516b\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff08RGB vs. RGB-D\uff09\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b140\u4e07\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982MultiMAE\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff1a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752825%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RGB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6539\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76APR\u4ee3\u7406\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u548cBRT\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528BRT\u4ee3\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684BRT\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\u5305\u542bBRT\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfAPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u751f\u6210BRT\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540ccogeneration\u7b56\u7565\u5728120\u4e2aGoogle\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u4eba\u7c7bbug\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8003\u8651\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u66f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3002", "result": "Cogeneration\u7b56\u7565\u4f7fAPR\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u81f3\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528BRT\u4ee3\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684bug\u751f\u6210BRT\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Cogeneration\u7b56\u7565\u5141\u8bb8APR\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4fee\u590d\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528BRT\u4ee3\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684BRT\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u5355\u72ec\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u52aa\u529b\u3002"}}

This work has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of IEEE SYSCON 2026", "summary": "Robots sometimes have to work together with a mixture of partially-aligned or conflicting goals. Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u534f\u5546\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee3\u7406\u5e38\u5728\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u65b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u4f53\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u534f\u5546\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u90bb\u4ee3\u7406\u8ffd\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u96c6\u4f53\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u5bdf\u534f\u5546\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u534a\u4fe1\u4efb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production.

We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality.

This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training.

Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild.

However, existing mutation testing techniques fall short in capturing many types of common faults in dynamically typed languages like Python. In this paper, we introduce a novel set of seven mutation operators that are inspired by prevalent anti-patterns in Python programs, designed to complement the existing general-purpose operators and broaden the spectrum of simulated faults. We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model. PyTation also incurs few equivalent mutants, aided by dynamic analysis heuristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "PyTation \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9 Python \u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u72ec\u7279\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7b49\u6548\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982 Python\uff09\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8bb8\u591a\u5e38\u89c1\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e03\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9 Python \u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u53cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "PyTation \u5728 13 \u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90 Python \u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "PyTation \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction.

These tasks include code generation, summarization, understanding, repair, testing, and optimization. This trend is growing faster with large language models and autonomous agents. A key challenge is how to design reward signals that make sense for software. In many RL problems, the reward is a clear number. In software, this is often not possible. The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics. Many reward designs have been proposed for code-related tasks. However, the work is scattered across areas and papers. There is no single survey that brings these approaches together and shows the full landscape of reward design for RL in software.

To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $\u03bb$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality.

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels.

Ghaleb", "Daniel Alencar da Costa", "Ying Zou"], "title": "The Promise and Reality of Continuous Integration Caching: An Empirical Study of Travis CI Builds", "comment": null, "summary": "Continuous Integration (CI) provides early feedback by automatically building software, but long build durations can hinder developer productivity. CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features.

Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \\model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text.

However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches.

This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "NuiWorld\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u7684\u6241\u5e73\u5411\u91cf\u96c6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "NuiWorld\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u8349\u56fe\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "NuiWorld\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u573a\u666f\u5757\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV.

Specifically, our study evaluates five latest and representative LLM-based methods and two traditional tools using: 1) an in-house benchmark of 222 known real-world vulnerabilities (C/C++ and Java) to assess detection capability, and 2) 24 active open-source projects, where we manually inspected 385 warnings to assess their practical usability and underlying root causes of failures. Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes.

In this paper, we study the energy efficiency of these systems. As AI becomes seamlessly available in these tools and, in many cases, is active by default, we are entering a new era with significant implications for energy consumption patterns throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). We focus on advanced Machine Learning (ML) capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our proposed approach combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Prompt Engineering Techniques (PETs) to enhance both the quality and energy efficiency of LLM-based code generation. We present a comprehensive framework that measures real-time energy consumption and inference time across diverse model architectures ranging from 125M to 7B parameters, including GPT-2, CodeLlama, Qwen 2.5, and DeepSeek Coder.

However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks.

While this accelerates software development and supports learning, it also raises new risks for academic integrity, authorship attribution, and responsible AI use. This paper investigates the problem of distinguishing human-written from machine-generated code by comparing two complementary approaches: feature-based detectors built from lightweight, interpretable stylometric and structural properties of code, and embedding-based detectors leveraging pretrained code encoders. Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6743\u8861\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u8f7b\u677e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u3001\u4f5c\u8005\u5f52\u5c5e\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u548c\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5305\u542b60\u4e07\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08ROC-AUC 0.995\uff0cPR-AUC 0.995\uff0cF1 0.971\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f7f\u7528CodeBERT\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff08ROC-AUC 0.994\uff0cPR-AUC 0.994\uff0cF1 0.965\uff09\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7f29\u8fdb\u548c\u7a7a\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u8457\u533a\u5206\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u5d4c\u5165\u6355\u83b7\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u7f16\u5199\u548c\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u6355\u83b7\u4e0a\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u6e90\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \\emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment.

Code is available at https://github.com/Luffy03/GF-Screen", "summary": "Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen.

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT).

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of code review dynamics in agent-generated PRs. Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u6863\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660eAI\u52a0\u901f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u4ea7\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5ba1\u9605\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u9645\u54cd\u5e94AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AIDev\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9eGitHub\u4ed3\u5e93\u76843,177\u4e2aAI\u751f\u6210\u7684PR\u4e2d\u768419,450\u6761\u5185\u8054\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e8612\u4e2a\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793aLLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u5728\u8bc4\u8bba\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0878.63%\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\uff0c0.78\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728PR\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e3b\u9898\uff0878% Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c0.76\u5e73\u5747Jaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s).

Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpikeScore\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08GHD\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5355\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpikeScore\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5206\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u975e\u5e7b\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSpikeScore\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikeScore\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows.

A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLyapunov\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\u9879\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6RL\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Lyapunov\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u5c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u76d1\u7763\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLyapunov\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6RL\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\u4ece84.6%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523099.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Lyapunov\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u5c42\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5230\u8fbe\u7387\uff0c\u4ece84.6%\u63d0\u5347\u81f399.0%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5931\u8d25\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method.

Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9SINS/DVL\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684SINS/DVL\u677e\u8026\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u901f\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f66\u8f86\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684DVL\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u7eb3\u5165\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u5f71\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff1b2. \u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u9879\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u957f\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u53d1\u6563\u3002\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfIMU+DVL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c3D\u4f4d\u7f6eRMSE\u6539\u5584\u4e8678.3%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5206\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8671.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SINS/DVL\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c3D\u4f4d\u7f6eRMSE\u6539\u5584\u4e8678.3%\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5206\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8671.8%\u3002"}}

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors.

The final version appears in ACM CHASE 2026", "summary": "As GenAI models are adopted to support software engineers and their development teams, understanding effective human-AI collaboration (HAIC) is increasingly important. Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u8ddd\u662f\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u800c\u975e\u60c5\u611f\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7bSEI\u7279\u8d28\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GenAI\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ca\u5176\u5f00\u53d1\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff08HAIC\uff09\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\uff08SEI\uff09\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c0810\u540d\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53caAI\u961f\u53cb\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\uff08SEI\uff09\u671f\u671b\u548cAI\u80fd\u529b\u8bbe\u60f3\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u76ee\u524d\u5c06AI\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u667a\u529b\u961f\u53cb\u800c\u975e\u793e\u4ea4\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u7684SEI\u5c5e\u6027\u671f\u671b\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u961f\u53cb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u611f\u5dee\u8ddd\u662fAI\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u534f\u5546\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6216\u7ef4\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7f3a\u4e4fSEI\u7279\u8d28\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u7269\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7bSEI\u5c5e\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0eAI\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u975e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u611f\u667a\u80fd\uff08SEI\uff09\u7279\u8d28\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u534f\u4f5c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution.

These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative.

To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an \"AI-assisted, Expert-verified\" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285\\% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed.

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure.

Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges.

We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains.

The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge.

Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle.

It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM.

In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines.

However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects.

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings.

To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution.

Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework.

Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion.

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets.

While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead.

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code.

Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components.

PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis.

Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration.

Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs.

This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination.

In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity.

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c12\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ee3\u7406\u6027AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u6027AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u6784\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u51fa12\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u578b\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u578b\u3001\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5982\u4f55\u7ea0\u6b63ReAct\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c12\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "HARMONI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5927\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6301\u7eed\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "HARMONI\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u8bc6\u522b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u53ca\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u77ed\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u66f4\u65b0\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u6863\u6848\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u517b\u8001\u9662\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cHARMONI\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HARMONI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u7528\u6237\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment.

However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance.

Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit.

Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75).

Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions.

We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates.

Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion.

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7InstaRadar\u589e\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210RCDPT\u5230BEVDepth\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u76ee3D\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728BEV\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u96f7\u8fbe\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aInstaRadar\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u548c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RCDPT\u96c6\u6210\u5230BEVDepth\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "InstaRadar\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cRCDPT\u96c6\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebfBEVDepth\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6BEV\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7a0d\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u96f7\u8fbe\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e5f\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u6269\u5c55InstaRadar\u81f3\u7c7b\u4f3c\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5e26\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aBEV\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling.

Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u5e73\u7b49\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u7eb3\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u8bb0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u975e\u8f6c\u79fb\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u80bf\u7624\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4e00\u81f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8111\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u975e\u8f6c\u79fb\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors.

Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead.

To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth.

However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cor2Vox\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8111MRI\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f31\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u5f15\u5bfc3D\u5f62\u72b6\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u6865\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e33,000\u591a\u4e2aUK Biobank\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3001\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u8111\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "Cor2Vox\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u76ae\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8111MRI\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored.\n  Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.\n  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64).

Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%.

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST.

We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes.

While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation.

Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints.

Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM).

This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities.

The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities.

We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities.

We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates.

Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs.

However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization.

Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling.

To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception.

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation.

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding.

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.", "AI": {"tldr": "HexFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u66f2\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\uff09\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HexFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7eaf\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff08HexFormer\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\uff08HexFormer-Hybrid\uff09\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHexFormer\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u53cc\u66f2ViT\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u9884\u70ed\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f83\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6307\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u805a\u5408\uff09\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global.

These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area.
