We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification. FCP grounds graded applicability from language using an LLM with k-sample median aggregation and supports meeting-in-the-middle search using residuum-based backward requirements.

We therefore aim to develop Insight Agents (IA), a conversational multi-agent Data Insight system, to provide E-commerce sellers with personalized data and business insights through automated information retrieval. Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

We introduce light field display point rendering (LFDPR), which meets these challenges by improving eye-based point rendering [Gavane and Watson 2023] with texture-based splatting, which avoids oversampling of triangles mapped to only a few texels; and with LFD-biased sampling, which adjusts horizontal and vertical triangle sampling to match the sampling of the LFD itself. To improve image quality, we introduce multiview mipmapping, which reduces texture aliasing even though compute shaders do not support hardware mipmapping.

Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively.

However, existing human-in-the-loop RL (HiL-RL) frameworks often suffer from low sample efficiency, requiring substantial human interventions to achieve convergence and thereby leading to high labor costs. To address this, we propose a sample-efficient real-world human-in-the-loop RL framework named \\method, which requires fewer human intervention by actively selecting informative samples. Specifically, stable reduction of policy entropy enables improved trade-off between exploration and exploitation with higher sample efficiency. We first build influence functions of different samples on the policy entropy, which is efficiently estimated by the covariance of action probabilities and soft advantages of policies. Then we select samples with moderate values of influence functions, where shortcut samples that induce sharp entropy drops and noisy samples with negligible effect are pruned. Extensive experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that \\method achieves a 42.1\\% higher success rate while requiring 10.1\\% fewer human interventions compared to the state-of-the-art HiL-RL method, validating its effectiveness.

While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

While most existing methods rely on rasterization to render Gaussians, recent research has started investigating ray tracing approaches to overcome the fundamental limitations inherent in rasterization. However, current Gaussian ray tracing methods suffer from inefficiencies such as bloated acceleration structures and redundant node traversals, which greatly degrade ray tracing performance.\n  In this work, we present GRTX, a set of software and hardware optimizations that enable efficient ray tracing for 3D Gaussian-based rendering. First, we introduce a novel approach for constructing streamlined acceleration structures for Gaussian primitives. Our key insight is that anisotropic Gaussians can be treated as unit spheres through ray space transformations, which substantially reduces BVH size and traversal overhead. Second, we propose dedicated hardware support for traversal checkpointing within ray tracing units. This eliminates redundant node visits during multi-round tracing by resuming traversal from checkpointed nodes rather than restarting from the root node in each subsequent round.

To address these issues, we introduce the Just-in-Time Informed Trees (JIT*) algorithm, an enhancement over Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), designed to improve path planning through two core modules: the Just-in-Time module and the Motion Performance module. The Just-in-Time module includes \"Just-in-Time Edge,\" which dynamically refines edge connectivity, and \"Just-in-Time Sample,\" which adjusts sampling density in bottleneck areas to enable faster initial path discovery. The Motion Performance module balances manipulability and trajectory cost through dynamic switching, optimizing motion control while reducing the risk of singularities. Comparative analysis shows that JIT* consistently outperforms traditional sampling-based planners across $\\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{16}$ dimensions.

As LLMs increasingly serve as evaluators in code-based RL, their ability to detect reward hacking remains understudied. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE.

Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates.

However, traditional change detection methods based on remote sensing imagery have obvious limitations in high-level and intelligent analysis, and thus are difficult to meet the requirements of current urban planning and management. In face of the growing demand for complex multi-modal data analysis in urban park development monitoring, these methods often fail to provide flexible analysis capabilities for diverse application scenarios. This study proposes a multi-modal LLM agent framework, which aims to make full use of the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLM to meet the challenges in urban park development monitoring. In this framework, a general horizontal and vertical data alignment mechanism is designed to ensure the consistency and effective tracking of multi-modal data. At the same time, a specific toolkit is constructed to alleviate the hallucination issues of LLM due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge.

A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent with structured action decomposition and QoE-aware reward shaping resolves the resulting high-dimensional control problem.

Project page at https://remac-async.github.io/", "summary": "Real-time execution is essential for cyber-physical systems such as robots. These systems operate in dynamic real-world environments where even small delays can undermine responsiveness and compromise performance. Asynchronous inference has recently emerged as a system-level paradigm for real-time robot manipulation, enabling the next action chunk to be predicted while the current one is being executed. While this approach achieves real-time responsiveness, naive integration often results in execution failure. Previous methods attributed this failure to inter-chunk discontinuity and developed test-time algorithms to smooth chunk boundaries. In contrast, we identify another critical yet overlooked factor: intra-chunk inconsistency, where the robot's executed action chunk partially misaligns with its current perception. To address this, we propose REMAC, which learns corrective adjustments on the pretrained policy through masked action chunking, enabling the policy to remain resilient under mismatches between intended actions and actual execution during asynchronous inference. In addition, we introduce a prefix-preserved sampling procedure to reinforce inter-chunk continuity. Overall, our method delivers more reliable policies without incurring additional latency.

When high request rates exhaust the KV cache budget, existing LLM inference systems often suffer severe head-of-line (HOL) blocking.

SuperInfer introduces RotaSched, the first proactive, SLO-aware rotary scheduler that rotates requests to maintain responsiveness on Superchips, and DuplexKV, an optimized rotation engine that enables full-duplex transfer over NVLink-C2C. Evaluations on GH200 using various models and datasets show that SuperInfer improves TTFT SLO attainment rates by up to 74.7% while maintaining comparable TBT and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating that SLO-aware scheduling and memory co-design unlocks the full potential of Superchips for responsive LLM serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperInfer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u578b\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSuperchips\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u8bf7\u6c42\u7387\u4e0b\u56e0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u8017\u5c3d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u961f\u5934\u963b\u585e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347TTFT\u548cTBT SLO\u7684\u8fbe\u6807\u7387\u3002", "method": "SuperInfer\u5f15\u5165\u4e86RotaSched\uff08\u9996\u4e2a\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001SLO\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff09\u548cDuplexKV\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f15\u64ce\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301NVLink-C2C\u5168\u53cc\u5de5\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728GH200\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cSuperInfer\u5c06TTFT SLO\u8fbe\u6807\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe74.7%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684TBT\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperInfer\u901a\u8fc7SLO-aware\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u4e86Superchips\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior research shows that the adoption and use of AI-powered tools differ between core and peripheral developers. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic unfolds in the emerging era of autonomous coding agents. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of 9,427 agentic PRs, examining how core and peripheral developers use, review, modify, and verify agent-generated contributions prior to acceptance. Through a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis, we make four key contributions. First, a subset of peripheral developers use agents more often, delegating tasks evenly across bug fixing, feature addition, documentation, and testing. In contrast, core developers focus more on documentation and testing, yet their agentic PRs are frequently merged into the main/master branch. Second, core developers engage slightly more in review discussions than peripheral developers, and both groups focus on evolvability issues. Third, agentic PRs are less likely to be modified, but when they are, both groups commonly perform refactoring. Finally, peripheral developers are more likely to merge without running CI checks, whereas core developers more consistently require passing verification before acceptance.

Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.\n  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + \u03b5$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = \u03a9(n k^{-1} \u03b5^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + \u03b5$ cannot be reduced below $\\lg n+\\lg(\u03b5^{-1})-\\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.\n  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error.

We introduce $\\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution. Across four medical reasoning benchmarks, $\\method$ achieves substantial gains over existing methods, improving MedQA accuracy by 23.5% and MedXpertQA by 32.0% relative to the base generator in particular.

However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity.

However, many real-world scalar field mapping applications rely on sensor-equipped mobile robots to collect field measurements, where imperfect localization introduces state uncertainty. Such discrepancies between the estimated and true measurement locations degrade GP mean and covariance estimates. To address this challenge, we propose a method for updating the GP models when improved estimates become available. Leveraging the differentiability of the kernel function, a second-order correction algorithm is developed using the precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of the GP mean and covariance functions for real-time refinement based on measurement location discrepancy data. Simulation results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u65f6\u5047\u8bbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7cbe\u786e\u5df2\u77e5\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u6821\u6b63\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability. The study shows that structured representations and multi-task classification based on high-dimensional metrics can significantly improve contention pattern recognition and offer a reliable technical approach for performance management in complex computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7ade\u4e89\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8026\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ade\u4e89\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ade\u4e89\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u53d6\u8de8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u673a\u5236\u6355\u6349\u6307\u6807\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8d44\u6e90\u94fe\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u7ade\u4e89\u7c7b\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u533a\u5206\u591a\u79cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5bf9\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6307\u6807\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although such PRs promise productivity gains, their post-merge code quality remains underexplored, as prior work has largely relied on benchmarks and controlled tasks rather than large-scale post-merge analyses. To address this gap, we analyze 1,210 merged agent-generated bug-fix PRs from Python repositories in the AIDev dataset. Using SonarQube, we perform a differential analysis between base and merged commits to identify code quality issues newly introduced by PR changes. We examine issue frequency, density, severity, and rule-level prevalence across five agents. Our results show that apparent differences in raw issue counts across agents largely disappear after normalizing by code churn, indicating that higher issue counts are primarily driven by larger PRs. Across all agents, code smells dominate, particularly at critical and major severities, while bugs are less frequent but often severe.

The required edge-connectivity $k$ is a chosen, constant parameter. Unlike standard dynamic graph problems, such as dynamic minimum-cut, which focus solely on reporting the value of the minimum cut, our approach actively modifies the graph $G$ to maintain the edge-connectivity invariant $\u03bb(G) \\ge k$. We address two fundamental maintenance tasks: redundancy elimination, which identifies and removes an existing edge rendered redundant for $k$-edge-connectivity by new edge insertion, and connectivity restoration, which computes and inserts a minimal set of augmenting edges to restore graph's $k$-edge-connectivity following an old edge deletion. To preclude trivial reversals, we strictly enforce that the eliminated edge is distinct from the inserted edge and that restoration excludes the already deleted edge. Our solution of the first problem integrates Nagamochi-Ibaraki sparse certificates [Nagamochi and Ibaraki 1992] with Link-Cut Trees [Sleator and Tarjan 1983] to remove redundant edges in $O(k \\log n)$ amortized time. For restoration, we propose a localized augmentation strategy that exploits the residual graph structure to bridge the minimum cut.

Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.\n  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities.

Due to near-infinite degrees of freedom, complex dynamics, and heterogeneous patterns, existing vision-based affordance prediction methods often suffer from boundary overflow and fragmented functional regions. To address these issues, we propose TRACER, a Texture-Robust Affordance Chain-of-thought with dEformable-object Refinement framework, which establishes a cross-hierarchical mapping from hierarchical semantic reasoning to appearance-robust and physically consistent functional region refinement. Specifically, a Tree-structured Affordance Chain-of-Thought (TA-CoT) is formulated to decompose high-level task intentions into hierarchical sub-task semantics, providing consistent guidance across various execution stages. To ensure spatial integrity, a Spatial-Constrained Boundary Refinement (SCBR) mechanism is introduced to suppress prediction spillover, guiding the perceptual response to converge toward authentic interaction manifolds. Furthermore, an Interactive Convergence Refinement Flow (ICRF) is developed to aggregate discrete pixels corrupted by appearance noise, significantly enhancing the spatial continuity and physical plausibility of the identified functional regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the Fine-AGDDO15 dataset and a real-world robotic platform demonstrate that TRACER significantly improves affordance grounding precision across diverse textures and patterns inherent to deformable objects. More importantly, it enhances the success rate of long-horizon tasks, effectively bridging the gap between high-level semantic reasoning and low-level physical execution.

We investigate the problem of maintaining spanners in the fully dynamic setting with an adaptive adversary. Despite a long line of research, this problem is still poorly understood: no algorithm achieving a sublogarithmic stretch, a sublinear in $n$ update time, and a strongly subquadratic in $n$ spanner size is currently known.\n  One of our main results is a deterministic algorithm, that, for any $512 \\leq k \\leq (\\log n)^{1/49}$ and $1/k\\leq \u03b4\\leq 1/400$, maintains a spanner $H$ of a fully dynamic graph with stretch $poly(k)\\cdot 2^{O(1/\u03b4^6)}$ and size $|E(H)|\\leq O(n^{1+O(1/k)})$, with worst-case update time $n^{O(\u03b4)}$ and recourse $n^{O(1/k)}$. Our algorithm relies on a new technical tool that we develop, called low-diameter router decomposition. We design a deterministic algorithm that maintains a decomposition of a fully dynamic graph into edge-disjoint clusters with bounded vertex overlap, where each cluster $C$ is a bounded-diameter router, meaning that any reasonable multicommodity demand over the vertices of $C$ can be routed along short paths and with low congestion. A similar graph decomposition notion was introduced by [Haeupler et al., STOC 2022] and strengthened by [Haeupler et al., FOCS 2024]. However, in contrast to these and other prior works, the decomposition that our algorithm maintains is proper, ensuring that the routing paths between the pairs of vertices of each cluster $C$ are contained inside $C$, rather than in the entire graph $G$. We show additional applications of our router decomposition, including dynamic algorithms for fault-tolerant spanners and low-congestion spanners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u56fe\uff08spanner\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u62c9\u4f38\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b8c\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u56fe\uff08spanner\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5b50\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u65e0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e9a\u5bf9\u6570\u62c9\u4f38\u3001\u4e9a\u7ebf\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5f3a\u4e9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5b50\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u5b8c\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8fb9\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u7c07\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u7684\u9876\u70b9\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u76f4\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u4e3apoly(k)\u22c52^O(1/\u03b4^6)\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3aO(n^(1+O(1/k)))\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bn^O(\u03b4)\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548cn^O(1/k)\u7684\u8865\u6551\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u679c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u62c9\u4f38\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u56fe\uff08spanner\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f4e\u76f4\u5f84\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, these models fall short in real-world scenarios, lacking multi-turn conversational ability, on-device efficiency, and precise understanding of ECG measurements such as the PQRST intervals. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Agent, the first LLM-based tool-calling agent for multi-turn ECG dialogue.

To address this, we introduce TouchGuide, a novel cross-policy visuo-tactile fusion paradigm that fuses modalities within a low-dimensional action space. Specifically, TouchGuide operates in two stages to guide a pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching visuomotor policy at inference time. First, the policy produces a coarse, visually-plausible action using only visual inputs during early sampling. Second, a task-specific Contact Physical Model (CPM) provides tactile guidance to steer and refine the action, ensuring it aligns with realistic physical contact conditions. Trained through contrastive learning on limited expert demonstrations, the CPM provides a tactile-informed feasibility score to steer the sampling process toward refined actions that satisfy physical contact constraints. Furthermore, to facilitate TouchGuide training with high-quality and cost-effective data, we introduce TacUMI, a data collection system. TacUMI achieves a favorable trade-off between precision and affordability; by leveraging rigid fingertips, it obtains direct tactile feedback, thereby enabling the collection of reliable tactile data.

These workloads often combine multiple parallel runtimes within the same application or across co-located jobs, creating scheduling demands that place significant stress on traditional OS schedulers. When oversubscribed (there are more ready threads than cores), OS schedulers rely on periodic preemptions to multiplex cores, often introducing interference that may degrade performance. In this paper, we present: (1) The User-space Scheduling Framework (USF), a novel seamless process scheduling framework completely implemented in user-space. USF enables users to implement their own process scheduling algorithms without requiring special permissions. We evaluate USF with its default cooperative policy, (2) SCHED_COOP, designed to reduce interference by switching threads only upon blocking. This approach mitigates well-known issues such as Lock-Holder Preemption (LHP), Lock-Waiter Preemption (LWP), and scalability collapse. We implement USF and SCHED_COOP by extending the GNU C library with the nOS-V runtime, enabling seamless coordination across multiple runtimes (e.g., OpenMP) without requiring invasive application changes.

Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs--commonly referred to as Code Language Models CLMs--have demonstrated remarkable capability. This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities. In this study, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by systematically evaluating how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect ILMs and CLMs in code generation tasks.

Training-free pruning solutions (e.g., EOS-attention based methods) can reduce index vector size by approximately 60% without model adaptation, but often underperform random selection in high-compression scenarios (> 80%). Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression.

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing. The Judge verifies the relevance and consistency of retrieved content, triggering iterative retrieval when evidence is insufficient or invoking the Refresher upon detecting logical conflicts. The Refresher then enforces memory consistency by performing targeted updates or removing outdated entries. Extensive experiments on challenging long-context benchmarks show that AMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while reducing token consumption by approximately 80% compared to full-context methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining retrieval precision and long-term memory consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u7c92\u5ea6\u50f5\u5316\u3001\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u79ef\u7d2f\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u3001\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "AMA\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Constructor\u548cRetriever\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\uff0cJudge\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cRefresher\u6267\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u5220\u9664\u8fc7\u65f6\u6761\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAMA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea680%\u7684token\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "AMA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86token\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

This coarse granularity incurs extra kernel launches, forces device-wide synchronizations at kernel boundaries, and leaves substantial slack when the slowest tile or kernel stretches the communication tail. We present AutoOverlap, a compiler and runtime that enables automatic fine-grained overlap inside a single fused kernel. AutoOverlap introduces a communication chunk abstraction that decouples communication granularity from kernel structure and backend mechanisms, allowing chunk-level plans to be ported from existing distributed compilers, written directly by users, or instantiated from reusable templates. Given a local Triton kernel and a chunk schedule, AutoOverlap performs transformations to align computation with chunk availability.

The final version will appear in the ACM Digital Library as part of the MSR'26 conference proceedings", "summary": "Logs are essential for understanding Continuous Integration (CI) behavior, particularly for diagnosing build failures and performance regressions. Yet their growing volume and verbosity make both manual inspection and automated analysis increasingly costly, time-consuming, and environmentally costly. While prior work has explored log compression, anomaly detection, and LLM-based log analysis, most efforts target structured system logs rather than the unstructured, noisy, and verbose logs typical of CI workflows.\n  We present LogSieve, a lightweight, RCA-aware and semantics-preserving log reduction technique that filters low-information lines while retaining content relevant to downstream reasoning. Evaluated on CI logs from 20 open-source Android projects using GitHub Actions, LogSieve achieves an average 42% reduction in lines and 40% reduction in tokens with minimal semantic loss. This pre-inference reduction lowers computational cost and can proportionally reduce energy use (and associated emissions) by decreasing the volume of data processed during LLM inference.\n  Compared with structure-first baselines (LogZip and random-line removal), LogSieve preserves much higher semantic and categorical fidelity (Cosine = 0.93, GPTScore = 0.93, 80% exact-match accuracy). Embedding-based classifiers automate relevance detection with near-human accuracy (97%), enabling scalable and sustainable integration of semantics-aware filtering into CI workflows. LogSieve thus bridges log management and LLM reasoning, offering a practical path toward greener and more interpretable CI automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LogSieve\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9CI\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u7eff\u8272CI\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "CI\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u5f97\u6602\u8d35\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u800c\u975eCI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5178\u578b\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u5608\u6742\u548c\u5197\u957f\u65e5\u5fd7\u3002", "method": "LogSieve\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e5\u5fd7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90Android\u9879\u76ee\u7684GitHub Actions CI\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cLogSieve\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c1142%\u7684\u884c\u6570\u548c40%\u7684token\u6570\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLogSieve\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08Cosine=0.93\uff0cGPTScore=0.93\uff0c80%\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LogSieve\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\uff08CI\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models. Across multiple benchmarks, our best configuration reduces computational cost by up to 65% while preserving an average of 95% task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9LLaDA-V\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLaDA-V\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8303\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLaDA-V\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5230\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe65%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u5747\u4fdd\u755995%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548LLaDA-V\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process.

This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

However, due to their predominant reliance on visual modalities, they fundamentally lack the physical intuition required for contact-rich tasks that require precise force regulation and physical reasoning. Existing attempts to incorporate vision-based tactile sensing into VLA models typically treat tactile inputs as auxiliary visual textures, thereby overlooking the underlying correlation between surface deformation and interaction dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a paradigm shift from tactile-vision alignment to tactile-force alignment. Here, we introduce TaF-VLA, a framework that explicitly grounds high-dimensional tactile observations in physical interaction forces. To facilitate this, we develop an automated tactile-force data acquisition device and curate the TaF-Dataset, comprising over 10 million synchronized tactile observations, 6-axis force/torque, and matrix force map. To align sequential tactile observations with interaction forces, the central component of our approach is the Tactile-Force Adapter (TaF-Adapter), a tactile sensor encoder that extracts discretized latent information for encoding tactile observations. This mechanism ensures that the learned representations capture history-dependent, noise-insensitive physical dynamics rather than static visual textures. Finally, we integrate this force-aligned encoder into a VLA backbone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that TaF-VLA policy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tactile-vision-aligned and vision-only baselines on contact-rich tasks, verifying its ability to achieve robust, force-aware manipulation through cross-modal physical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "TaF-VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f4\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TaF-VLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86TaF-Dataset\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662fTactile-Force Adapter\uff08TaF-Adapter\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u89e6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "TaF-VLA\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e6\u89c9-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "TaF-VLA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9-\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, sophisticated software supply chain security threats often stem from cascaded vulnerability and security weakness chains that span dependent components. Moreover, although the adoption of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) has been accelerating, downstream vulnerability findings vary substantially across SBOM generators and analysis tools. We propose a novel approach to SBOM-driven security analysis methods and tools. We model vulnerability relationships over dependency structure rather than treating scanner outputs as independent records. We represent enriched SBOMs as heterogeneous graphs with nodes being the SBOM components and dependencies, the known software vulnerabilities, and the known software security weaknesses. We then train a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to predict whether a component is associated with at least one known vulnerability. Since documented multi-vulnerability chains are scarce, we model cascade discovery as a link prediction problem over CVE pairs using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. This way, we produce ranked candidate links that can be composed into multi-step paths.

Hwu"], "title": "Demonstration-Free Robotic Control via LLM Agents", "comment": null, "summary": "Robotic manipulation has increasingly adopted vision-language-action (VLA) models, which achieve strong performance but typically require task-specific demonstrations and fine-tuning, and often generalize poorly under domain shift. We investigate whether general-purpose large language model (LLM) agent frameworks, originally developed for software engineering, can serve as an alternative control paradigm for embodied manipulation. We introduce FAEA (Frontier Agent as Embodied Agent), which applies an LLM agent framework directly to embodied manipulation without modification. Using the same iterative reasoning that enables software agents to debug code, FAEA enables embodied agents to reason through manipulation strategies. We evaluate an unmodified frontier agent, Claude Agent SDK, across the LIBERO, ManiSkill3, and MetaWorld benchmarks. With privileged environment state access, FAEA achieves success rates of 84.9%, 85.7%, and 96%, respectively. This level of task success approaches that of VLA models trained with less than 100 demonstrations per task, without requiring demonstrations or fine-tuning. With one round of human feedback as an optional optimization, performance increases to 88.2% on LIBERO. This demonstration-free capability has immediate practical value: FAEA can autonomously explore novel scenarios in simulation and generate successful trajectories for training data augmentation in embodied learning. Our results indicate that general-purpose agents are sufficient for a class of manipulation tasks dominated by deliberative, task-level planning. This opens a path for robotics systems to leverage actively maintained agent infrastructure and benefit directly from ongoing advances in frontier models.

Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "AF\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u548cp2p\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u96fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u96fe\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684Agentic AI\uff08AAI\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u56e0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578bAgentic Fog\uff08AF\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u96fe\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u534f\u8c03\u7684p2p\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b56\u7565\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u96fe\u534f\u8c03\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u6f5c\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793aAF\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AF\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u6545\u969c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8d2a\u5a6a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this study, we present the first analysis of agentic refactoring pull requests in Java, comparing them to developer refactorings across 86 projects per group. Using RefactoringMiner and DesigniteJava 3.0, we identify refactoring types and detect code smells before and after refactoring commits. Our results show that agent refactorings are dominated by annotation changes (the 5 most common refactoring types done by agents are annotation related), in contrast to the diverse structural improvements typical of developers.

Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing.

Existing methods either shorten CoTs at the semantic level, which is often conservative, or prune tokens aggressively, which can miss task-critical cues and degrade accuracy. Moreover, combining the two is non-trivial due to sequential dependency, task-agnostic pruning, and distribution mismatch. We propose \\textbf{CtrlCoT}, a dual-granularity CoT compression framework that harmonizes semantic abstraction and token-level pruning through three components: Hierarchical Reasoning Abstraction produces CoTs at multiple semantic granularities; Logic-Preserving Distillation trains a logic-aware pruner to retain indispensable reasoning cues (e.g., numbers and operators) across pruning ratios; and Distribution-Alignment Generation aligns compressed traces with fluent inference-time reasoning styles to avoid fragmentation. On MATH-500 with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, CtrlCoT uses 30.7\\% fewer tokens while achieving 7.6 percentage points higher than the strongest baseline, demonstrating more efficient and reliable reasoning.

While recent studies have examined how AI agents support software development tasks (e.g., code generation, issue resolution, and PR automation), their role in documentation tasks remains underexplored-even though documentation is widely consumed and shapes how developers understand and use software.\n  Using the AIDev, we analyze 1,997 documentation-related pull requests (PRs) authored by AI agents and human developers, where documentation PRs are those that create or modify project documentation artifacts. We find that AI agents submit substantially more documentation-related PRs than humans in the studied repositories. We further observe that agent-authored documentation edits are typically integrated with little follow-up modification from humans, raising concerns about review practices and the reliability of agent-generated documentation.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps.

While previous studies on human-AI cooperation have primarily focused on dyadic interactions, little is known about how integrating AI agents affects the emergence and maintenance of cooperative norms in small groups. This study addresses this gap through an online experiment using a repeated four-player Public Goods Game (PGG). Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230AI\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4eba\u673a\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u56db\u73a9\u5bb6\u516c\u5171\u7269\u54c1\u6e38\u620f\uff08PGG\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ec4\u7531\u4e09\u540d\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216AI\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u4e09\u79cd\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u4f5c\u6c34\u5e73\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u975e\u4f19\u4f34\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u7b49\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u5728\u96c6\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002"}}

We propose STORM (Slot-based Task-aware Object-centric Representation for robotic Manipulation), a lightweight object-centric adaptation module that augments frozen visual foundation models with a small set of semantic-aware slots for robotic manipulation. Rather than retraining large backbones, STORM employs a multi-phase training strategy: object-centric slots are first stabilized through visual--semantic pretraining using language embeddings, then jointly adapted with a downstream manipulation policy.

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning.

Although numerous analog field trials address these goals, comparing their results remains challenging because of differences in robot platforms and experimental setups. These missions typically assess performance using selected, scenario-specific engineering metrics that fail to establish a clear link between field performance and science-driven objectives. In this paper, we address this gap by deriving a structured framework of KPI from three realistic multi-robot lunar scenarios reflecting scientific objectives and operational constraints. Our framework emphasizes scenario-dependent priorities in efficiency, robustness, and precision, and is explicitly designed for practical applicability in field deployments. We validated the framework in a multi-robot field test and found it practical and easy to apply for efficiency- and robustness-related KPI, whereas precision-oriented KPI require reliable ground-truth data that is not always feasible to obtain in outdoor analog environments.

However, recent vulnerabilities in third-party packages have led to serious security breaches, compromising the integrity of applications that depend on them. Objective: This study investigates how npm package developers perceive and handle security in their work. We examined developers' understanding of security risks, the practices and tools they use, the barriers to stronger security measures, and their suggestions for improving the npm ecosystem's security. Method: We conducted an online survey with 75 npm package developers and undertook a mixed-methods approach to analyzing their responses. Results: While developers prioritize security, they perceive their packages as only moderately secure, with concerns about supply chain attacks, dependency vulnerabilities, and malicious code. Only 40% are satisfied with the current npm security tools due to issues such as alert fatigue. Automated methods such as two-factor authentication and npm audit are favored over code reviews. Many drop dependencies due to abandonment or vulnerabilities, and typically respond to vulnerabilities in their packages by quickly releasing patches. Key barriers include time constraints and high false-positive rates. To improve npm security, developers seek better detection tools, clearer documentation, stronger account protections, and more education initiatives. Conclusion: Our findings will benefit npm package contributors and maintainers by highlighting prevalent security challenges and promoting discussions on best practices to strengthen security and trustworthiness within the npm landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "npm\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u91cd\u89c6\u5b89\u5168\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "npm\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5305\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u67e5\u5bf975\u540dnpm\u5305\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u867d\u7136\u91cd\u89c6\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5305\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u62c5\u5fc3\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u6076\u610f\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u53ea\u670940%\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dnpm\u5b89\u5168\u5de5\u5177\u6ee1\u610f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u8b66\u62a5\u75b2\u52b3\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u53cc\u56e0\u7d20\u8ba4\u8bc1\u548cnpm\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u88ab\u5f03\u7528\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\u800c\u653e\u5f03\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5e03\u8865\u4e01\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6539\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u6587\u6863\u3001\u8d26\u6237\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u4e3anpm\u5305\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3anpm\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks.

This paper presents a scalable alternative: high-accuracy whole-body touch localization via vibro-acoustic sensing. By equipping a robotic hand with seven low-cost piezoelectric microphones and leveraging an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, we decode the vibrational signatures generated during physical interaction. Extensive evaluation across stationary and dynamic tasks reveals a localization error of under 5 mm in static conditions. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the distinct influence of material properties: stiff materials (e.g., metal) excel in impulse response localization due to sharp, high-bandwidth responses, whereas textured materials (e.g., wood) provide superior friction-based features for trajectory tracking.

Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes.

However, most existing multi-robot collaboration methods rely on extensive task-specific training, which limits their adaptability to new or diverse scenarios. Recent research leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enable more flexible collaboration without specialized training. Yet, current LLM-empowered approaches remain inefficient: when confronted with identical or similar tasks, they must replan from scratch because they omit task-level similarities. To address this limitation, we propose MeCo, a similarity-aware multi-robot collaboration framework that applies the principle of ``cache and reuse'' (a.k.a., memoization) to reduce redundant computation. Unlike simple task repetition, identifying and reusing solutions for similar but not identical tasks is far more challenging, particularly in multi-robot settings. To this end, MeCo introduces a new similarity testing method that retrieves previously solved tasks with high relevance, enabling effective plan reuse without re-invoking LLMs. Furthermore, we present MeCoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate performance on similar-task collaboration scenarios.

To facilitate their adoption by language designers, the comprehensibility of the language used to define other languages is an important aspect to evaluate. Moreover, considering that language workbenches are relatively new tools, user acceptance emerges as a crucial factor to be accounted for during their assessment. Current literature often neglects user-centred aspects like comprehensibility and acceptance in the assessment of this breed of tools. This paper addresses this gap through a family of experiments assessing Neverlang, a modular language workbench. The study adopts a tailored version of the Method Evaluation Model (MEM) to evaluate the comprehensibility of Neverlang's meta-language and programs, as well as user acceptance in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use. It also investigates the relationships among these dimensions. The experiments were conducted in three iterations involving participants from academia. The results reveal that users demonstrate sufficient comprehension of Neverlang's meta-language, particularly concerning its syntax, express a favourable perception of its usefulness, and indicate their intention to use it. However, the results also indicate that Neverlang's ease of use remains a challenge. Additionally, variations in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, whether low or high, influence the users' intention to use the tool. Surprisingly, no significant correlation is found between comprehensibility and user acceptance. Notably, higher comprehensibility of the meta-language does not necessarily translate into greater acceptance, underscoring the complex interplay between comprehension and adoption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0Neverlang\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u8a00\u5de5\u4f5c\u53f0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7248\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08MEM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff08\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3001\u6709\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9Neverlang\u7684\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8ba4\u53ef\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u5e76\u6709\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9Neverlang\u7684\u5143\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u6709\u7528\u5e76\u6709\u610f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u7528\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u5f71\u54cd\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4f46\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities.

Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data.

Existing methods for locomotion and whole-body control work well for position-based control with environment-specific heuristics (e.g., reward shaping, curriculum design, and manual initialization), but are less effective for torque-based control, where sufficiently exploring the action space and obtaining informative gradient signals for training is significantly more difficult. We introduce Growing Policy Optimization (GPO), a training framework that applies a time-varying action transformation to restrict the effective action space in the early stage, thereby encouraging more effective data collection and policy learning, and then progressively expands it to enhance exploration and achieve higher expected return.

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

This paper presents a computational method for estimating joint positions from measured tendon displacements and tensions. An efficient kinematic modeling framework for anthropomorphic hands is first introduced based on the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Using a simplified tendon model, a system of nonlinear equations relating tendon states to joint positions is derived and solved via a nonlinear optimization approach. The estimated joint angles are then employed for closed-loop control through a Jacobian-based proportional-integral (PI) controller augmented with a feedforward term, enabling gesture tracking without direct joint sensing. The effectiveness and limitations of the proposed estimation and control framework are demonstrated in the MuJoCo simulation environment using the Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand, featuring five degrees of freedom for each long finger and six degrees of freedom for the thumb.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u808c\u8171\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u5f20\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8282\u4f20\u611f\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eDenavit-Hartenberg\u7ea6\u5b9a\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u808c\u8171\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Jacobian-based PI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u524d\u9988\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Anatomically Correct Biomechatronic Hand\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8282\u4f20\u611f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u624b\u52bf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\\%, 84\\%, and 97. 12\\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively.

However, large codebases can make this reporting challenging. This paper employs an empirical approach to understand developers' experience with Google Play Store's Data Safety Section (DSS) form.\n  We first survey 41 Android developers to understand how they categorize privacy-related data into DSS categories and how confident they feel when completing the DSS form. To gain a broader and more detailed view of the challenges developers encounter during the process, we complement the survey with an analysis of 172 online developer discussions, capturing the perspectives of 642 additional developers. Together, these two data sources represent insights from 683 developers.\n  Our findings reveal that developers often manually classify the privacy-related data their apps collect into the data categories defined by Google-or, in some cases, omit classification entirely-and rely heavily on existing online resources when completing the form. Moreover, developers are generally confident in recognizing the data their apps collect, yet they lack confidence in translating this knowledge into DSS-compliant disclosures. Key challenges include issues in identifying privacy-relevant data to complete the form, limited understanding of the form, and concerns about app rejection due to discrepancies with Google's privacy requirements.\n  These results underscore the need for clearer guidance and more accessible tooling to support developers in meeting privacy-aware reporting obligations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u5b8c\u6210Google Play\u7684Data Safety Section\u8868\u5355\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5206\u7c7b\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728Google Play\u5546\u5e97\u7684Data Safety Section\uff08DSS\uff09\u8868\u5355\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8c03\u67e5\u4e8641\u540dAndroid\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5230DSS\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b8c\u6210DSS\u8868\u5355\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5206\u6790\u4e86172\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u4e86642\u540d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u7701\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u5b8c\u6210\u8868\u5355\uff1b\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aDSS\u5408\u89c4\u62ab\u9732\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5bf9\u8868\u5355\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u53ca\u62c5\u5fc3\u5e94\u7528\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\u4e0d\u7b26\u800c\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u62a5\u544a\u4e49\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts.

Unlike conventional automation that relies on labor-intensive 2D labeling, our framework leverages reusable warm-up trajectories to extract implicit spatial information, thereby achieving calibration-aware, depth-resolved perception without the need for external fiducials or manual depth annotation. By explicitly characterizing residuals from observation and calibration models, the system establishes a task-space error budget from recorded warm-ups. The uncertainty budget yields a lateral closed-loop accuracy of approx. 49 micrometers at 95% confidence (worst-case testing subset) and a depth accuracy of <= 291 micrometers at 95% confidence bound during large in-plane moves.

By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses.

However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "C-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22SAM\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u7eaf\u526a\u679dSAM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5e94\u7528SAM\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6270\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cC-SAM\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u6700\u9ad842%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u672a\u526a\u679d\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "C-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9510\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u63a9\u7801\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Through systematic analysis of representative neuro-symbolic workloads, we identify probabilistic logical reasoning as the inefficiency bottleneck, characterized by irregular control flow, low arithmetic intensity, uncoalesced memory accesses, and poor hardware utilization on CPUs and GPUs.\n  This paper presents REASON, an integrated acceleration framework for probabilistic logical reasoning in neuro-symbolic AI. REASON introduces a unified directed acyclic graph representation that captures common structure across symbolic and probabilistic models, coupled with adaptive pruning and regularization. At the architecture level, REASON features a reconfigurable, tree-based processing fabric optimized for irregular traversal, symbolic deduction, and probabilistic aggregation. At the system level, REASON is tightly integrated with GPU streaming multiprocessors through a programmable interface and multi-level pipeline that efficiently orchestrates compositional execution. Evaluated across six neuro-symbolic workloads, REASON achieves 12-50x speedup and 310-681x energy efficiency over desktop and edge GPUs under TSMC 28 nm node.

An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.\n  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.\n  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability.

Unlike general-purpose engines such as ONNX Runtime, today's LLM inference systems offer little operator-level visibility, leaving developers blind to where time and resources go. Even basic questions -- is this workload memory-bound or compute-bound? -- often remain unanswered. To close this gap, we develop a fine-grained, non-intrusive profiling framework for modern LLM inference engines, exemplified by llama.cpp but applicable to similar runtime architectures. Built on extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology, our system dynamically attaches probes to runtime functions across multiple layers -- without modifying or recompiling the source. It transforms collected traces into rich visualizations of operators, graphs, timelines, and hardware counter trends, exposing how dense inference, Mixture-of-Experts routing, and operator offloading behave in practice. With less than 4% runtime overhead and high profiling fidelity, our framework makes LLM inference both transparent and diagnosable, turning performance profiling into a practical tool for optimization, scheduling, and resource-aware deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7eBPF\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u5411\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684Berkeley Packet Filter\uff08eBPF\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9644\u52a0\u63a2\u9488\u5230\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u591a\u5c42\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u7f16\u8bd1\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e4%\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c55\u793a\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eeBPF\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6210\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

Our system utilizes two key innovations: Sequential Research Plan Refinement via Reflection and a Candidates Crossover algorithm. The sequential refinement process is demonstrated as an efficient method that allows the agent to maintain a centralized Global Research Context, enabling it to look back at current progress, reason about the research plan, and intelligently make changes at runtime. This dynamic adaptation contrasts with parallel approaches, which often suffer from siloed knowledge. The Candidates Crossover algorithm further enhances search efficiency by deploying multiple LLM candidates with varied parameters to explore a larger search space, with their findings synthesized to curate a comprehensive final research response. The process concludes with One Shot Report Generation, ensuring the final document is informed by a unified narrative and high fact density. Powered by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, our Deep Researcher was evaluated on the DeepResearch Bench, a globally recognized benchmark of 100 doctoral level research tasks. Our architecture achieved an overall score of 46.21, demonstrating superior performance by surpassing leading deep research agents such as Claude Researcher, Nvidia AIQ Research Assistant, Perplexity Research, Kimi Researcher and Grok Deeper Search present on the DeepResearch Bench actively running leaderboard.

However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation.

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights.

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpatialGenEval \u662f\u8bc4\u4f30 T2I \u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d T2I \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u56e0\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u77ed\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u7a00\u758f\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b 1,230 \u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u548c 15,400 \u4e2a\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 25 \u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u548c 10 \u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u4e86 21 \u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb T2I \u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08Stable Diffusion-XL +4.2%\uff0cUniworld-V1 +5.7%\uff0cOmniGen2 +4.4%\uff09\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "SpatialGenEval \u548c SpatialT2I \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 T2I \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process.

To address these issues, we propose RepSFNet (Reparameterized Single Fusion Network), a lightweight architecture designed for accurate and real-time crowd estimation. RepSFNet leverages a RepLK-ViT backbone with large reparameterized kernels for efficient multi-scale feature extraction. It further integrates a Feature Fusion module combining Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Context-Aware Network (CAN) to achieve robust, density-adaptive context modeling. A Concatenate Fusion module is employed to preserve spatial resolution and generate high-quality density maps. By avoiding attention mechanisms and multi-branch designs, RepSFNet significantly reduces parameters and computational complexity. The training objective combines Mean Squared Error and Optimal Transport loss to improve both count accuracy and spatial distribution alignment. Experiments conducted on ShanghaiTech, NWPU, and UCF-QNRF datasets demonstrate that RepSFNet achieves competitive accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 34 percent compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time and low-power edge computing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "RepSFNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u5728\u53d8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "RepSFNet\u91c7\u7528RepLK-ViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5927\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ASPP\u548cCAN\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Concatenate Fusion\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728ShanghaiTech\u3001NWPU\u548cUCF-QNRF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRepSFNet\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8634%\u3002", "conclusion": "RepSFNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines.

Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data.

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability.

The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks.

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity.

However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision.

Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations.

Motivated by this insight, we propose to \"contaminate\" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images.

Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification.

The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''.

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6ROAD\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001ROAD\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u578b\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8def\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u591a\u53d8\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5730\u533a\u3002"}}

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation.

By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation.

Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR.

These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features.

Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u4ee4\u724c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u3001AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08AIGC\uff09\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c55\u671b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u4ee4\u724c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeFix\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u56fe\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5FreeFix\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c2D-3D\u4ea4\u9519\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFreeFix\u5728\u591a\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeFix\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c2D-3D\u4ea4\u9519\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
