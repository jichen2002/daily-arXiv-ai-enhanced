*Matteo Rossi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MA-LipNet方法，通过多维度注意力模块显著提升唇读性能，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于发音动作的微妙性，现有的唇读方法往往特征区分性有限且泛化能力差，因此需要从时间、空间和通道维度净化视觉特征。

Method: 提出了一种名为MA-LipNet的新方法，该方法依次应用三个专用注意力模块：通道注意力（CA）模块、联合时空注意力（JSTA）模块和分离时空注意力（SSTA）模块。

Result: 在CMLR和GRID数据集上的大量实验表明，MA-LipNet显著降低了字符错误率（CER）和单词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出MA-LipNet方法，强调了多维度特征细化对视觉语音识别的重要性，显著降低了CER和WER，验证了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Lipreading, the technology of decoding spoken content from silent videos of lip movements, holds significant application value in fields such as public security. However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究针对多轮对话中的非马尔可夫交互问题，提出了数据构建策略和训练框架，显著提升了多轮一致性和指令遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮基准和训练方法大多是马尔可夫的，即下一个输出主要依赖于最近的图像，这导致了忽略长期历史的捷径解决方案。本研究旨在解决更具挑战性的非马尔可夫设置，其中用户可能引用早期状态、撤销更改或引用多轮前引入的实体。

Result: 通过非马尔可夫多轮数据构建策略和训练框架，实现了在多轮一致性和指令遵从性方面的显著改进。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对非马尔可夫交互的显式训练在多轮一致性和指令遵从性方面带来了显著改进，同时保持了强大的单轮编辑和个性化能力。

Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

*Xuehua Ye,Hongxu Yang,Adam J. Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种文本引导的PET图像去噪方法，结合CLIP和U-Net模型，显著提升图像质量，适用于多种计数水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET图像在医学诊断中至关重要，但复杂的噪声会掩盖关键诊断信息，影响图像质量。

Method: 结合预训练的CLIP模型特征与基于U-Net的去噪模型，开发了一种新型文本引导去噪方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均显著提升了PET图像质量。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的基于文本引导的去噪方法在PET图像处理中表现出色，不仅提高了图像质量，还展现了处理复杂去噪需求或缩短采集时间的潜力。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LANE通过紧凑自回归依赖和AdaGraph策略，显著提升3D网格生成的序列长度和效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法资源利用率不足，导致推理速度慢且仅能处理小规模序列，限制了结构细节的表达。

Method: 引入Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE)和Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph)策略，通过时空解耦优化生成过程。

Result: LANE在最大可生成序列长度上实现了6倍的提升，并在生成速度、结构细节和几何一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: LANE结合AdaGraph策略，在生成速度、结构细节和几何一致性方面表现出色，为高质量3D网格生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

### [5] [Low performing pixel correction in computed tomography with unrolled network and synthetic data training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20995)
*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Lehel Ferenczi,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无需真实数据的双域LPP伪影校正方法，通过合成数据训练模型，实验表现优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低性能像素（LPP）会导致CT重建图像出现环形和条纹伪影，现有方法需要昂贵的专用数据集训练，且仅关注图像域或正弦图域校正，忽略了CT几何正向操作的固有相关性。

Method: 提出了一种基于合成数据的展开双域方法，利用自然图像生成的合成数据，通过训练模型校正LPP伪影。

Result: 在模拟1-2%探测器缺陷的实验中，该方法大幅优于现有技术，表明其无需数据收集成本即可校正LPP伪影。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于合成数据的展开双域方法能够有效校正CT探测器中的低性能像素（LPP）伪影，无需真实临床数据，且适应不同扫描仪设置。

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

### [6] [Synthetic-to-Real Domain Bridging for Single-View 3D Reconstruction of Ships for Maritime Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21786)
*Borja Carrillo-Perez,Felix Sattler,Angel Bueno Rodriguez,Maurice Stephan,Sarah Barnes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于单视图的3D船舶重建方法，完全在合成数据上训练，无需真实3D注释，适用于实时海事监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法需要多视图监督或标注的3D地面真实数据，计算量大，难以实时应用于海事监控。

Method: 使用Splatter Image网络，将对象表示为稀疏的3D高斯集合，结合YOLOv8分割模块和自定义预处理，通过后处理步骤实现真实世界比例、居中和方向对齐。

Result: 在合成验证数据上表现出强重建保真度，在ShipSG数据集的真实海事图像上验证了向实际海事场景迁移的潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种高效的基于单视图的3D船舶重建管道，通过完全在合成数据上训练，实现了无需真实世界3D注释的实时船舶可视化，为海事监控提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

TL;DR: AI模型通过活检切片预测前列腺癌术后复发风险，在外部验证中表现稳定，整合临床变量可提升预后价值，但需进一步评估其相较于简单模型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预测前列腺癌根治术后生化复发（BCR）的工具不精确，需开发更准确的预后方法。

Method: 使用基础模型和基于注意力的多实例学习，在STHLM3队列（n=676）的诊断性前列腺活检切片上训练AI模型，预测患者特异性BCR风险，并在三个外部RP队列（LEOPARD、CHIMERA、TCGA-PRAD）中评估泛化能力。

Result: 图像方法在三个外部队列中的5年时间依赖性AUC分别为0.64、0.70和0.70；整合临床变量可提供互补预后价值并实现显著风险分层，相较于CAPRA-S指南，AI逐步改善了术后预后。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，基于活检组织病理学的AI模型能够跨样本类型泛化，支持术前和术后决策，但AI多模态方法相较于简单预测模型的额外价值需进一步研究。

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

### [8] [EditYourself: Audio-Driven Generation and Manipulation of Talking Head Videos with Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22127)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditYourself是一个基于DiT的音频驱动视频编辑框架，专注于说话头部视频的脚本修改，保持唇部同步和时间连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成视频模型在编辑预录制视频时的不足，特别是脚本修改时需要保持运动、时间连贯性、说话者身份和唇部同步的挑战。

Method: 基于DiT的框架，结合音频驱动和区域感知的编辑训练扩展，利用时空修复技术实现精确的唇部同步和时间连贯性。

Result: EditYourself能够无缝添加、删除和重新定时视觉口语内容，并在新添加的片段中合成逼真的人体运动。

Conclusion: EditYourself框架为专业视频后期制作提供了一种实用的生成式视频编辑工具，能够精确处理说话头部视频的脚本修改，同时保持视觉保真度和身份一致性。

Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.

### [9] [BadDet+: Robust Backdoor Attacks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21066)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadDet+是一个惩罚框架，统一了RMA和ODA攻击，展示了目标检测中的漏洞，并在物理鲁棒性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检测的后门攻击方法存在不切实际的假设和缺乏物理验证的弱点，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 引入基于惩罚的框架BadDet+，利用对数障碍惩罚抑制触发输入的真实类别预测，实现位置和尺度不变性及增强的物理鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试中，BadDet+在合成到物理的转移上优于现有RMA和ODA基线，同时保持干净性能。理论分析证实惩罚机制在触发特定特征子空间中可靠诱导攻击而不影响标准推理。

Conclusion: BadDet+框架通过惩罚机制有效统一了RMA和ODA攻击，揭示了目标检测中的严重漏洞，并强调了专门防御的必要性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

### [10] [Towards Mitigating Modality Bias in Vision-Language Models for Temporal Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21078)
*Jiaqi Li,Guangming Wang,Shuntian Zheng,Minzhe Ni,Xiaoman Lu,Guanghui Ye,Yu Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ActionVLM通过动态调整语言模态权重，减少模态偏差，提升时间动作定位性能，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖语言先验，导致模态偏差，影响了视觉性能。ActionVLM旨在系统性地解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一个去偏重新加权模块和残差聚合策略，动态评估语言优势并调整其权重，保持视觉信号的主导地位。

Result: 在THUMOS14数据集上，ActionVLM的性能比现有最优方法提高了3.2% mAP。

Conclusion: ActionVLM通过动态调整语言模态的权重，有效减轻了模态偏差，提升了时间动作定位的性能，实验证明其在THUMOS14数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成模型在组合结构约束（如生成计数、属性绑定和部件级关系）下的脆弱性问题。

Method: 提出Shape-of-Thought（SoT）框架，通过连贯的2D投影实现渐进式形状组装，无需外部引擎。训练统一的多模态自回归模型生成交错文本计划和渲染中间状态。

Result: 在SoT-26K数据集上微调后，模型在组件计数和结构拓扑上的表现分别达到88.4%和84.8%，比纯文本基线提升约20%。

Conclusion: SoT提出了一种透明、过程监督的组合生成新范式，显著提升了生成模型的组合结构能力。

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于AI的自动化评估系统，有效解决了传统微吻合术评估中的主观性和不一致性问题，证明了其高精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感影像具有密集分布的地物对象和复杂边界，现有方法难以满足几何定位和语义预测的高要求。

Method: SDCI通过交叉模型注意力融合（CAF）模块、双向跨图扩散细化（BCDR）模块和基于凸优化的超像素协作预测（CSCP）机制，实现了训练免费的开词汇语义分割。

Conclusion: SDCI方法在多个遥感语义分割基准测试中表现优于现有方法，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by merging them with Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has emerged as a promising direction. However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FRISM effectively improves reasoning capabilities without compromising the model's original visual capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse visual reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决生成检索在作为召回模型时的语义模糊和跨模态对齐问题，提升两阶段TVR性能。

Method: 提出GRDR方法，通过多视角标记器和共享代码本联合训练，生成多个语义ID以解决语义模糊和跨模态对齐问题。

Conclusion: GRDR方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了检索效率和存储效率，适用于大规模实时视频检索应用。

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

Conclusion: LAMP是一种针对多图像MLLMs的黑盒攻击方法，通过注意力约束和跨图像传染约束有效提升攻击成功率，并在实验中表现优于现有基线。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Conclusion: PTQ4ARVG框架成功解决了ARVG模型量化中的三个关键挑战，并在8位和6位量化下保持了竞争力。

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: 设计了傅里叶域滤波器，逐步抑制低频噪声并保留高频内容，将数据一致性先验直接注入采样过程。

Conclusion: NFCDS通过频谱调制机制有效解决了扩散采样中的保真度与感知质量之间的权衡问题，无需额外训练即可在现有扩散修复框架中无缝集成，提升零样本任务中的性能平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Hypersolid通过局部硬球排斥力防止表示崩溃，在细粒度和低分辨率分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在预测地理位置方面表现出色，但其生成的推理链经常出现幻觉，无法准确解释图像证据。这促使研究者创建了一个基准测试，以评估和改进视觉语言模型在生成可信推理链方面的能力。

Method: 本文引入了首个地理定位推理链基准测试，专注于流行的GeoGuessr游戏中的全球位置预测任务。通过与专家玩家合作，生成了800条真实推理链，用于评估视觉语言模型生成的推理链。采用了LLM-as-a-judge和VLM-as-a-judge策略来评分。

Result: 评估发现，Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge策略与人类评分的相关性最佳。大型闭源视觉语言模型在预测任务上表现优异，但在推理链生成上落后于人类专家；开放权重模型表现极差。

Conclusion: 当前的大型闭源视觉语言模型（如Gemini和GPT 5）在预测地理位置方面可以与人类专家媲美，但在生成可审核的推理链方面仍落后于人类专家。开放权重的视觉语言模型（如Llama和Qwen）在该基准测试中表现极差，仅略优于基线。这表明视觉语言模型在从高分辨率图像中提取细粒度视觉属性方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

Conclusion: WorldBench提供了一个更细致、可扩展的框架，用于严格评估视频生成和世界模型的物理推理能力，为更稳健、可泛化的世界模型驱动学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Conclusion: GBPN通过结合深度学习和概率图模型，在深度补全任务中实现了最先进的性能，并在不同稀疏度、稀疏模式和数据集上表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用半离散最优运输的几何特性，显著减轻了深度神经网络在分布外输入上的过度自信问题，并在实验中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 所有病理学特定模型均显著超越零基线恢复轨迹排序，其中仅视觉模型达到最高保真度（τ>0.78）。模型在参考疾病上的轨迹保真度排名强烈预测在保留疾病上的少样本分类性能（ρ=0.92），且探索性分析显示细胞类型组成沿推断轨迹平滑变化，与已知基质重塑模式一致。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型能够从独立的静态观察中隐式学习表示连续过程，且轨迹保真度提供了超越下游性能的表征质量补充衡量标准。这一框架不仅适用于病理学，也可应用于其他通过静态快照观察连续过程的领域。

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Method: 采用增强后校正的流程，包括分层光谱-空间协同注意力（H-S$^{3}$A）和流形一致性校正（MCR），并引入退化一致性损失来确保数据保真度。

Conclusion: 论文提出了SR$^{2}$-Net，一种轻量级即插即用的校正器，能够在不修改现有HSI-SR模型架构的情况下提升光谱一致性和重建质量。

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决现有方法中任务特定参数阻碍知识传递、检索成本高以及参数融合导致破坏性干扰和灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes定理，提出动态适配器融合（DAF）机制，通过泰勒展开损失函数推导最优融合系数，平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Result: 在多个CIL基准测试中，DAF实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DAF通过动态融合任务特定适配器和全局适配器参数，结合鲁棒初始化策略，在多个CIL基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Method: 提出了一种名为语义引导动态稀疏化（SGDS）的新方法，通过定向稀疏化调控激活空间的子空间方向和秩，促进知识迁移并防止干扰。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，SGDS实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SGDS通过动态稀疏化激活空间，有效缓解了类增量学习中的干扰问题，同时保持了模型的塑性，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Motivation: 现有视频3D人体网格恢复方法常因依赖有缺陷的中间3D姿态锚点及无法有效建模复杂时空动态，导致结果不真实。

Method: 1. Geometry-Aware Lifting Module：采用双扫描Mamba架构，结合几何线索从图像特征中直接生成可靠的3D姿态序列。2. Motion-guided Reconstruction Network：利用时间感知处理运动模式，增强网格的连贯性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M基准测试中，HMRMamba在重建准确性和时间一致性上均达到新最优水平，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: HMRMamba通过引入结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）和双核心创新模块，显著提升了3D人体网格重建的准确性和时间一致性，同时在计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing video-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) methods often produce physically implausible results, stemming from their reliance on flawed intermediate 3D pose anchors and their inability to effectively model complex spatiotemporal dynamics. To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.

Motivation: 极端视角和距离差异导致几何畸变，传统基于点积相似性的注意力机制失效。

Method: 提出了Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT)模块，显式修正相似性空间，并结合几何条件提示生成机制。

Result: 在四个AG-ReID基准测试中，GIQT框架在极端几何条件下表现稳健，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIQT框架通过显式修正相似性空间，显著提升了在极端几何条件下的鲁棒性，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UniMRG通过引入辅助生成任务显著提升了UMMs的理解能力，同时增强了生成能力，验证了生成与理解相互促进的潜力。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种双路径框架，通过静态流形偏差分支和微时间波动分支，有效检测AI生成视频中的流形投影波动现象，从而区分真实与高保真伪造视频。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

Motivation: 研究NeRFs在密集、自遮挡场景中定量3D分析的可靠性，发现隐式密度场在严重遮挡下存在基本失效模式（IGD）。

Method: 通过基于稀疏体素栅格化（SVRaster）的显式几何流程，从SfM特征几何初始化，将2D实例掩模投影到显式体素网格上，并通过递归分割强制几何分离。

Result: 显式几何方法在密集簇中实现了95.8%的恢复率，比隐式基线多恢复了43%的实例。

Conclusion: 显式几何先验是高度自遮挡3D场景中可靠定量分析的前提。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

Conclusion: Spava框架通过多GPU并行优化注意力机制，显著提升了长视频推理的效率，同时保持了任务性能，为处理更长、更复杂的视频提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

Motivation: 度量学习对检索至关重要，但其对嵌入几何和优化动态的影响尚未被充分理解。

Method: 引入了一个诊断框架VARIANCE（类内/类间方差）和GREEDINESS（活跃比率和梯度范数），用于比较七种代表性损失函数（Contrastive、Triplet、N-pair、InfoNCE、ArcFace、SCL和CCL）在五个图像检索数据集上的表现。

Result: 分析显示，Triplet和SCL保留了更高的类内方差和更清晰的类间边界，在细粒度设置中实现了更强的top-1检索性能。相比之下，Contrastive和InfoNCE通过许多小更新快速压缩嵌入，加速了收敛但可能过度简化类结构。N-pair实现了较大的平均分离但间距不均匀。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了效率与粒度之间的权衡，并提供了实用指导：在需要保留多样性和硬样本区分时优先选择Triplet/SCL，而在需要快速压缩嵌入时选择Contrastive/InfoNCE。

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

Conclusion: RT-DeepLoc在弱监督时间伪造定位任务中表现出色，通过重建误差和AICL损失函数实现了对伪造片段的精确识别。

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

The difficulty of this task lies in that physicians adjust their focus and decision criteria for device usage according to tabular data representing each patient's condition. To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork. The experiments using the clinical dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of HyperAdAgFormer. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/HyperAdAgFormer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式人工智能在图像生成和编辑中往往将两者分开处理，导致效率低下且难以保持空间一致性和语义连贯性，缺乏对对象关系和空间排列的结构化控制。

Method: SimGraph是一个统一的框架，将基于场景图的图像生成和编辑集成在一起，结合了基于令牌的生成和基于扩散的编辑方法。

Conclusion: SimGraph框架通过整合基于场景图的图像生成和编辑，提供了对对象交互、布局和空间一致性的精确控制，实验证明其优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: HERS框架通过领域专家适应提升扩散模型生成的车辆损坏图像质量，解决了合成数据滥用的风险，在文本忠实度和人类偏好上优于基线。


<details>

Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在车辆损坏合成方面的进步引发了对其在自动化保险工作流程中可靠性的担忧，需要解决合成数据可能被滥用于欺诈或索赔操纵的风险。

Method: 提出了HERS框架，通过领域特定的专家适应微调基础扩散模型，无需手动标注。利用大型语言模型和T2I管道自动生成的自监督图像-文本对，将每个损坏类别建模为单独的专家，最终整合为一个统一的多损坏模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领域特定扩散模型在汽车保险等高风险应用中的机遇与风险，并指出可信生成在安全关键应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

TL;DR: ViK是一种无注意力的视觉骨干网络，通过KAN-based令牌混合实现高效长程交互，性能与注意力机制相当但复杂度更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在现代视觉骨干中虽然重要，但其二次复杂度及注意力权重难以解释的问题限制了可扩展性和清晰性，因此寻找替代方案具有动机。

Method: ViK采用MultiPatch-RBFKAN作为统一的令牌混合器，结合了（a）基于径向基函数的KAN的补丁级非线性变换，（b）轴可分离混合以实现高效的局部传播，（c）低秩全局映射用于长程交互。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，ViK以线性复杂度实现了竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ViK展示了基于KAN的令牌混合作为一种高效且理论上有依据的注意力替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

Method: BA-solver结合了双向时间感知和双锚点速度积分，通过SideNet学习未来和历史速度，无需重新训练主干网络。

Result: 在ImageNet-256^2上，BA-solver仅需10 NFEs即可达到与100+ NFEs Euler求解器相当的生成质量，且在5 NFEs时仍保持高保真度。

Conclusion: BA-solver通过引入轻量级SideNet和双向时间感知，显著提升了Flow Matching模型的生成效率，同时保持了高保真度，且训练成本极低。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

Conclusion: UDBM通过创新的不确定性感知扩散桥模型，成功解决了All-in-One图像恢复中的优化目标冲突问题，实现了在单次推理步骤中跨多种恢复任务的最先进性能。

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database. This research establishes a new paradigm for accessible environmental monitoring, demonstrating that professional-grade water quality assessment can be achieved through intelligent system architecture and cost-effective component selection.

Conclusion: WMVLM通过视觉语言模型（VLMs）为扩散模型图像水印提供了首个统一且可解释的评估框架，显著提升了水印评估的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

Method: 通过量化不同模型在不同处理阶段的表示距离，跟踪模型处理过程中表示距离的演变，识别模型间差异最大的处理步骤。

Result: 发现虽然不同模型中相似位置的层具有最相似的表示，但仍存在显著差异。分类器模型会丢弃关于低层次图像统计的信息，而CNN和Transformer模型在表示变化上表现不同，Transformer的变化更为平滑。

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在潜在扩散模型中，自动编码器（AE）需要平衡重建保真度和生成友好潜在空间的能力。研究发现当前评估偏向生成指标，可能影响可控扩散的性能。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证验证，研究了AE在可控扩散中的表现，特别是对条件漂移和重建保真度的评估。

Result: 研究发现gFID对条件保存的预测能力较弱，而重建导向的指标更符合可控性需求。ControlNet实验进一步证实可控性与条件保存相关而非gFID。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ImageNet-centric AE评估与可扩展可控扩散需求之间的差距，为更可靠的基准测试和模型选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

Conclusion: 论文提出的RSGround-R1框架通过逐步增强空间理解能力，在遥感视觉定位任务中表现出卓越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

Conclusion: CAF-Mamba 通过显式和隐式捕捉跨模态交互，并动态调整模态贡献，实现了更有效的多模态融合，显著提升了抑郁症检测的性能。

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出egName，一种几何感知正则化框架，通过模态内分散和模态间锚定约束，有效解决多模态学习中的几何病理问题，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习旨在整合异构模态的互补信息，但单纯的强优化并不能保证表示的结构良好。即使在精心平衡的训练方案下，多模态模型仍常表现出几何病理，包括模态内表示崩溃和样本级跨模态不一致性，这些问题会降低单模态的鲁棒性和多模态融合的效果。

Method: 提出了一种名为egName的轻量级几何感知正则化框架，该框架在中间嵌入上施加了两个互补的约束：促进表示多样性的模态内分散正则化，以及在不进行刚性对齐的情况下限制样本级跨模态漂移的模态间锚定正则化。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试上的广泛实验表明，egName在多模态和单模态性能上均取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: egName作为一种轻量级的几何感知正则化框架，通过显式调节表示几何，有效缓解了模态间的权衡问题，提升了多模态和单模态性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

TL;DR: MVSC通过压缩3D sMRI为2D特征并与2D基础模型对齐，提升了AD分类性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在计算成本高、跨切片关系丢失和特征提取能力有限的问题，MVSC旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: MVSC包含两个关键组件：Volume Context Encoder用于捕获全局跨切片上下文，以及Adaptive Slice Fusion模块以文本增强的补丁方式聚合切片级信息。

Result: 在三个大规模阿尔茨海默病基准测试中，MVSC在二元和多类分类任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MVSC方法通过将3D sMRI体积压缩为2D视觉替代特征，并与冻结的2D基础模型对齐，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病分类的性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有基于流水线的图表编辑方法无法忠实执行复杂编辑，因此需要一种端到端的评估基准。

Method: 通过设计包含1,200多个高质量样本的数据管道，ChartE$^{3}$直接评估模型，不依赖中间自然语言或代码表示。

Result: 对多模态大语言模型的广泛测试显示，在全局编辑任务上存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ChartE$^{3}$ benchmark揭示了当前端到端图表编辑能力的局限性，特别是在全局编辑任务上，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

Conclusion: DreamActor-M2通过两阶段范式（融合参考外观与运动线索至统一潜在空间，以及自举数据合成流程）解决了现有方法在身份保持与运动一致性之间的权衡问题，并减少了对显式姿态先验的依赖，实现了跨域泛化的高性能动画合成。

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

TL;DR: GMC通过3D相关性表面分析IQA模型性能，解决了传统标量指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局相关性指标（如PLCC和SRCC）无法捕捉IQA模型在局部质量谱上的排名一致性变化，且对测试样本质量分布敏感。

Method: 提出了Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)，包括Granularity Modulator和Distribution Regulator，通过高斯加权相关性和质量分布正则化，生成3D相关性表面。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GMC揭示了标量指标无法看到的性能特征，提供了更丰富和可靠的分析范式。

Conclusion: GMC提供了一种更细致、更可靠的方法来分析和比较IQA模型，揭示了传统标量指标无法捕捉的性能特征。

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有拓扑规划方法中的'粒度刚性'问题，即固定几何阈值无法适应环境复杂性，导致简单区域过采样和高不确定性区域欠采样。

Method: DGNav引入了两种核心创新：场景感知自适应策略和动态图Transformer，前者动态调整图构建阈值，后者融合视觉、语言和几何线索重建图连接性。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE基准测试中，DGNav表现出卓越的导航性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DGNav框架通过动态调整地图密度和连接性，在连续环境中的视觉语言导航任务中实现了导航效率和安全性之间的最优平衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Conclusion: CG-MLLM成功将高分辨率3D内容生成引入主流LLM范式，显著优于现有MLLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Method: 通过三阶段流程（大规模数据收集与标准化、CoT原理生成、基于推理质量和难度感知的全面筛选）构建MMFineReason数据集，并基于该数据集微调Qwen3-VL-Instruct模型。

Conclusion: MMFineReason数据集及其衍生的模型在参数效率上表现出色，甚至超越了一些更大的专有模型，同时揭示了‘少即是多’的现象和推理导向数据对通用能力的协同提升效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

Result: 提出的方法无需训练，与现有扩散主干兼容，能够在复杂文档上生成视觉连贯且保留前景的结果。

Conclusion: 通过将扩散过程重新定义为潜在空间中的轨迹设计，本文提出了一种原则性的方法，用于实现一致性和结构化的生成建模。

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based framework for document-centric background generation that achieves foreground preservation and multi-page stylistic consistency through latent-space design rather than explicit constraints. Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

Result: 在DiT-XL-2-256、Flux和Stable Diffusion 3.5等模型上验证了生成保真度、提示对齐和鲁棒性的显著提升。

Conclusion: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) 的优化视角揭示了其作为梯度近似的本质，并通过同伦优化和流形约束改进了生成质量、提示对齐和对引导尺度的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Conclusion: PaFu-KV策略通过动态保留关键令牌并丢弃冗余信息，显著提升了长时视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: TraceRouter通过切断有害信息的因果传播路径，显著提升了大型基础模型对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了模型的通用性能。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: FeatJND提供了一种任务对齐的特征空间容忍边界，有效控制特征质量，并在动态量化等应用中展现出优势。

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Shallow Alignment通过对比学习策略有效解决了人类与机器视觉之间的粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了神经视觉解码的性能，并揭示了预训练视觉骨干容量与解码性能之间的可扩展规律。

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

Conclusion: Drive-JEPA框架通过结合V-JEPA和多模态轨迹蒸馏，在端到端自动驾驶中实现了新的最先进性能，显著提升了规划表示的学习效果。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Human action anticipation is commonly treated as a video understanding problem, implicitly assuming that dense temporal information is required to reason about future actions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.

Conclusion: 融合3D SAR点云与航空影像的神经表面重建框架显著提升了稀疏视角条件下的重建精度、完整性和鲁棒性，为大规模高保真城市重建提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Abstract: Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Abstract: Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.

TL;DR: ePAI是一种AI系统，能高效早期检测胰腺癌，性能优于放射科医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）通常在晚期才被发现，回顾性研究表明专家放射科医生在已知患者后续发展PDAC的情况下，常能发现之前被忽视的病变。

Method: 开发了一个名为ePAI的自动化系统，基于1,598名患者的数据训练，并在内部和外部测试中验证其性能。

Result: ePAI在内部测试中AUC为0.939-0.999，敏感性95.3%，特异性98.7%；外部测试中AUC为0.918-0.945，敏感性91.5%，特异性88.0%。此外，ePAI在临床诊断前3至36个月的CT扫描中成功检测到被放射科医生忽视的PDAC。

Conclusion: ePAI作为一种辅助工具，有望改善胰腺癌的早期检测。

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

Motivation: 解决全图像重照明中数据稀缺、物理合理性保持和泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架，包括批量感知注意力、物理引导的神经渲染模块、物理启发的损失函数以及多样化的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，PI-Light在多种材质上能合成镜面高光和漫反射，相比现有方法在真实场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: PI-Light通过结合物理启发的扩散模型和精心设计的数据集，显著提升了全图像重照明的效果，特别是在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

TL;DR: VI-Probe框架通过可控视觉错觉实验揭示VLMs响应持续性的多原因性，挑战单一机制解释，提倡探测式评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉错觉任务中表现出对明显视觉变化的不敏感性，引发了对模型是否真正感知视觉变化或仅依赖记忆模式的疑问。

Method: 本文提出了VI-Probe，一个可控的视觉错觉框架，结合分级扰动和匹配的视觉控制，以区分视觉基础感知与语言驱动的回忆。通过极性翻转一致性、模板固定指数和相对于匹配控制的错觉乘数来测量稳定性和敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，响应持续性由多种原因引起，而非单一机制。例如，GPT-5表现出记忆覆盖，Claude-Opus-4.1显示感知-记忆竞争，而Qwen变体则暗示视觉处理限制。

Conclusion: VI-Probe框架揭示了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉错觉任务中响应持续性的多原因性，挑战了单一机制的解释，并提倡基于探测的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

TL;DR: UEval 是一个评估统一模型的多模态生成能力的基准测试，采用基于评分标准的自动评分系统，结果显示当前模型表现有限，推理能力是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法可能无法捕捉多模态生成的细微差别，因此需要一种更精细和可扩展的自动评分系统。

Method: UEval 包含 1,000 个专家策划的问题，这些问题需要模型输出同时包含图像和文本。评估采用基于评分标准的系统，由多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成初始评分标准，并由人类专家验证和细化。

Result: GPT-5-Thinking 在 UEval 上得分为 66.4（满分 100），而最佳开源模型仅得 49.1。推理模型表现优于非推理模型，且推理能力的迁移显著缩小了性能差距。

Conclusion: UEval 是一个用于评估统一模型（能够生成图像和文本的模型）的基准测试，结果显示当前统一模型在该测试上表现仍有提升空间，尤其是推理能力对于复杂多模态任务的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需潜在空间的一步扩散/流生成方法，填补现有技术的空白。

Method: 提出pMF方法，核心是将网络输出空间（低维图像流形）与损失空间（速度空间的MeanFlow）分离，并引入图像流形与平均速度场之间的简单转换。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，pMF在256x256分辨率（2.22 FID）和512x512分辨率（2.48 FID）下实现了一步生成的高质量结果。

Conclusion: pMF（pixel MeanFlow）通过将网络输出空间和损失空间分开设计，成功实现了无需潜在空间的一步生成，为扩散/流生成模型的边界推进提供了关键支持。

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

TL;DR: 论文评估了三种路由方法在故障EJ网络中的表现，RL方法在有效可达性和吞吐量上接近理论最优，且无需全局拓扑知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多核架构密度的增加，需要高性能且具备故障弹性的互连网络。Eisenstein-Jacobi（EJ）网络的对称6-正则拓扑提供了优越的拓扑特性，但在故障条件下对传统路由启发式方法提出了挑战。

Method: 评估了三种路由范式：确定性贪婪自适应路由、理论最优的Dijkstra算法和基于强化学习（RL）的方法。RL方法使用多目标奖励函数来惩罚故障接近并奖励路径效率。

Result: 在9个故障节点下，贪婪路由的有效可达性和数据包交付率降至10%，Dijkstra算法显示拓扑最优为52-54%，而RL代理实现了94%的有效可达性和91%的数据包交付率。RL在拥塞时通过隐式负载平衡策略甚至优于Dijkstra。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的自适应策略在故障多发的互连网络中提供了一种实用解决方案，弥合了贪婪路由的效率与Dijkstra算法的最优性之间的差距，无需全局拓扑知识或最优算法的计算开销。

Abstract: The increasing density of many-core architectures necessitates interconnection networks that are both high-performance and fault-resilient. Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.

Motivation: 解决分布式时间敏感系统中时间要求（可用性）与一致性之间的平衡问题，特别是在通信延迟和同步不确定性的情况下。

Method: 提出了maxwait协调机制，作为Lingua Franca协调语言的扩展，确保逻辑时间一致性并在延迟超限时提供结构化错误处理。

Result: maxwait机制不仅涵盖了经典分布式系统方法，还能实现多种常用模式，并提供了更好的时间控制、有界时间故障检测和确定性选项。

Conclusion: maxwait机制在分布式时间敏感系统中提供了一种简单且通用的协调方法，能够明确和配置时间与一致性的权衡，同时支持实时行为。

Abstract: Distributed time-sensitive systems must balance timing requirements (availability) and consistency in the presence of communication delays and synchronization uncertainty. This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework. Implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, maxwait enforces logical-time consistency when communication latencies are bounded and provides structured fault handling when bounds are violated.

Result: 实验表明，ZipMoE在代表性边缘计算平台上实现了最高72.77%的推理延迟降低和6.76倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: ZipMoE通过缓存调度协同设计，显著提升了边缘设备上MoE模型的推理效率，实现了延迟降低和吞吐量提升。

Abstract: While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures substantially bolster the expressive power of large-language models, their prohibitive memory footprint severely impedes the practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, especially when model behavior must be preserved without relying on lossy quantization. In this paper, we present ZipMoE, an efficient and semantically lossless on-device MoE serving system. ZipMoE exploits the synergy between the hardware properties of edge devices and the statistical redundancy inherent to MoE parameters via a caching-scheduling co-design with provable performance guarantee. Fundamentally, our design shifts the paradigm of on-device MoE inference from an I/O-bound bottleneck to a compute-centric workflow that enables efficient parallelization. We implement a prototype of ZipMoE and conduct extensive experiments on representative edge computing platforms using popular open-source MoE models and real-world workloads. Our evaluation reveals that ZipMoE achieves up to $72.77\%$ inference latency reduction and up to $6.76\times$ higher throughput than the state-of-the-art systems.

Result: SA-PSKY相比现有方法，通信开销降低60%，总响应时间减少40%，且在不同数据分布下表现稳健。

Conclusion: SA-PSKY框架通过动态阈值调整显著降低了通信开销和响应时间，展现了在边缘计算环境中的高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In the era of the Internet of Everything (IoE), the exponential growth of sensor-generated data at the network edge renders efficient Probabilistic Skyline Query (PSKY) processing a critical challenge. Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SA-PSKY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and heuristic baselines. Specifically, it achieves a reduction of up to 60\% in communication overhead and 40\% in total response time, while ensuring robust scalability across diverse data distributions.

TL;DR: Ira框架通过主节点传输紧凑提示信息，显著加速备份节点重放，在以太坊中实现25倍速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在传统的primary-backup复制中，备份节点重放交易的延迟受限于重执行时间。主节点已执行交易，拥有未来访问模式的知识，这正是优化重放所需的信息。

Method: 提出Ira框架，通过主节点传输包含未来访问模式的紧凑提示信息，优化备份节点的缓存管理。具体实现为Ira-L协议，用于改进以太坊区块执行的缓存管理。

Result: Ira-L在以太坊主网活动上的评估显示，提示信息紧凑（每个区块中位数增加47KB压缩数据），备份节点重放速度提升25倍，总重放时间从6.5小时降至16分钟（23.6倍加速）。

Conclusion: Ira框架通过传输紧凑的提示信息显著加速了备份节点的重放过程，尤其在以太坊环境中，Ira-L协议实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.
  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.
  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\sim5\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\times$ wall-time speedup).

Motivation: 解决混合工作负载下标准FCFS策略导致的头部阻塞问题，提升吞吐量和降低延迟。

Method: EWSJF包含四个组件：无监督分区算法Refine-and-Prune、动态队列路由、密度加权评分和贝叶斯元优化，用于实时调整评分和分区参数。

Result: 在vLLM中实现后，EWSJF使端到端吞吐量提升30%以上，短请求的平均首令牌时间减少至多4倍。

Conclusion: 自适应、基于学习的请求调度是高效响应式LLM服务的关键缺失层，EWSJF通过实时学习工作负载结构显著提升了吞吐量和公平性。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) under mixed workloads--short, latency-sensitive interactive queries alongside long, throughput-oriented batch requests--poses a fundamental scheduling challenge. Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is a powerful algorithm for distributed inference in probabilistic graphical models, however it quickly becomes infeasible for practical compute and memory budgets. Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.

TL;DR: ViTMAlis是一个针对ViT模型的动态设备到边缘卸载框架，通过混合分辨率推理策略减少延迟并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动视频分析应用从基于CNN的视觉模型转向基于ViT的模型，部署这些先进模型在延迟关键的MVA场景中面临显著挑战，尤其是密集预测任务中高分辨率输入加剧了ViT固有的二次计算复杂性。

Conclusion: ViTMAlis显著降低了端到端卸载延迟，同时提高了用户感知的渲染准确性，为下一代移动智能提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.

Conclusion: KubeSpace成功解决了LEO卫星网络中容器编排控制平面的高延迟和间歇性管理问题，通过分布式地面控制节点架构和轨道感知的动态分配策略，显著降低了管理延迟并消除了管理中断时间。

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites play a pivotal role in global connectivity-delivering high-speed Internet, cellular coverage, and massive IoT support. With ever-growing onboard computing and storage resources, LEO satellites herald a new cloud paradigm: space cloud computing. While container or chestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) excel in terrestrial data centers, they are ill-suited to LEO satellite networks, featuring geographic dispersion and frequent handovers. Those features bring high latency and intermittent management, leading to control plane failure in container orchestration. To address this, we propose KubeSpace, a low-latency and stable control plane specifically designed for container orchestration on LEO satellites. KubeSpace combines two key innovations: a distributed ground-control-node architecture that binds each satellite to its nearest controller for uninterrupted management, and an orbit-aware placement with dynamic assignment strategy that further minimizes communication latency and handover frequency. Extensive experiments based on real satellite traces demonstrate that compared to existing solutions, KubeSpace reduces the average management latency of satellite nodes by 59% without any management interruption time.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于Whittle索引的低复杂度算法，用于解决传感器云服务提供商（SCSP）在内容获取和广播问题中的优化问题，该算法在用户数量和复杂度方面表现优异。

Abstract: We consider a Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) system consisting of a sensor, a set of users, and a sensor cloud service provider (SCSP). The sensor updates its content each time it captures a new measurement. The SCSP occasionally fetches the content from the sensor, caches the latest fetched version and broadcasts it on being requested by the users. The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost. We extend this algorithm for heterogeneous case but the complexity grows exponentially with the number of users. To tackle this, we propose a low complexity Whittle index based algorithm, which performs very close to the optimal. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in number of users and serves as a heuristic for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

Result: STCL框架在仿真中表现出卓越的弹性，服务可靠性在阶段转换时恢复至约0.95，相比MADDPG基线实现20%的有效容量增益。

Conclusion: 本文提出的STCL框架通过G-MAPPO算法有效解决了移动边缘UAV网络在动态时空环境中的协调挑战，显著提升了服务弹性和容量增益。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of coordinating mobile edge UAV networks to maintain robust service in highly dynamic spatiotemporal environments. Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions. Compared to the MADDPG baseline, G-MAPPO not only prevents knowledge forgetting but also delivers an effective capacity gain of 20\% under extreme traffic loads, validating its potential as a scalable solution for edge-enabled aerial swarms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DRL在6G网络资源分配等问题中表现出色，但其代理的决策过程难以解释，阻碍了实际应用。SymbXRL旨在解决这一关键障碍。

Method: SymbXRL结合符号AI生成人类可理解的解释，通过直观符号和规则描述关键概念及其关系，并结合逻辑推理揭示DRL代理的决策过程。

Result: SymbXRL在实际网络管理用例中验证有效，不仅提升了解释的语义，还支持意图驱动的程序化行动引导，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SymbXRL不仅提升了DRL代理解释的语义清晰度，还为实现显式代理控制铺平了道路，如在纯DRL解决方案基础上提高了12%的中位数累积奖励。

Abstract: The operation of future 6th-generation (6G) mobile networks will increasingly rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize network decisions in real-time. DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的DRL代理是反应式的，无法利用短期预测，且预测增强的代理作为封闭盒子，运营商无法判断预测是否指导决策或增加了复杂性。

Method: SIA融合了符号AI抽象和每个KPI的知识图谱来生成解释，并引入了新的影响分数度量。

Result: SIA实现了亚毫秒级速度，比现有XAI方法快200倍以上，并在三个不同的网络用例中揭示了隐藏问题，如预测集成中的时间错位和奖励设计偏见。通过针对性修复，重新设计的代理在视频流中实现了9%更高的平均比特率，SIA的在线动作精炼模块在不重新训练的情况下将RAN切片奖励提高了25%。

Conclusion: SIA通过使预测增强的DRL透明化和可调优，降低了在下一代移动网络中实现主动控制的障碍。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) promises adaptive control for future mobile networks but conventional agents remain reactive: they act on past and current measurements and cannot leverage short-term forecasts of exogenous KPIs such as bandwidth. Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.

TL;DR: 提出一种将表面表示可微分转化为体积表示的方法，结合splatting渲染器和拓扑控制策略，在20分钟内优化实现高质量表面重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体积表示占用3D空间且具有沿光线的大有效感受野，可实现稳定高效的体积渲染优化，但后续网格化常产生过于密集的网格并引入累积误差；而纯表面方法虽避免网格化，但仅捕获边界几何且感受野单层，难以学习复杂几何细节并增加对先验的依赖。

Method: 将网格软化到多个半透明层，保持与基础网格的可微性，赋予其可控的3D感受野。结合基于splatting的渲染器和拓扑控制策略进行优化。

Result: 该方法在约20分钟内优化实现准确的表面重建，同时显著提高网格质量。

Conclusion: 通过将表面表示可微分地转化为体积表示，实现了通过体积渲染进行端到端表面重建，从而能够建模复杂几何形状。结合基于splatting的渲染器和拓扑控制策略，该方法可以在约20分钟内优化实现准确的表面重建，同时显著提高网格质量。

Abstract: Surfaces are typically represented as meshes, which can be extracted from volumetric fields via meshing or optimized directly as surface parameterizations. Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field. Combined with a splatting-based renderer and a topology-control strategy, our method can be optimized in about 20 minutes to achieve accurate surface reconstruction while substantially improving mesh quality.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的2D切片在解释空间关系方面支持有限，迫使用户在大脑中重建三维解剖结构。直接体积路径追踪和VR渲染可以改善感知，但计算成本高，而预计算表示（如高斯泼溅）需要提前规划。这两种方法都限制了交互使用。

Method: 该方法结合了流式注视点路径追踪和轻量级高斯泼溅近似外围区域的技术，通过体积数据优化外围模型生成，并利用注视点渲染持续改进，支持交互式更新。深度引导的重新投影进一步提高了对延迟的鲁棒性，并允许用户在保真度和刷新率之间取得平衡。

Result: 与直接路径追踪和高斯泼溅相比，该方法在保持视觉质量的同时，能够在不到一秒的时间内重新生成外围模型，消除了大量预处理和近似计算。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种混合渲染方法，结合了高质量、交互式和沉浸式的解剖可视化，为交互式医学可视化提供了新的选择。

Abstract: Volumetric medical imaging offers great potential for understanding complex pathologies. Yet, traditional 2D slices provide little support for interpreting spatial relationships, forcing users to mentally reconstruct anatomy into three dimensions. Direct volumetric path tracing and VR rendering can improve perception but are computationally expensive, while precomputed representations, like Gaussian Splatting, require planning ahead. Both approaches limit interactive use.
  We propose a hybrid rendering approach for high-quality, interactive, and immersive anatomical visualization. Our method combines streamed foveated path tracing with a lightweight Gaussian Splatting approximation of the periphery. The peripheral model generation is optimized with volume data and continuously refined using foveal renderings, enabling interactive updates. Depth-guided reprojection further improves robustness to latency and allows users to balance fidelity with refresh rate.
  We compare our method against direct path tracing and Gaussian Splatting. Our results highlight how their combination can preserve strengths in visual quality while re-generating the peripheral model in under a second, eliminating extensive preprocessing and approximations. This opens new options for interactive medical visualization.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.

Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.

Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.

Result: 在迎风和侧风条件下的广泛飞行实验表明，该方法显著提升了飞行稳定性。

Conclusion: 集成MHE-MPC框架在风扰环境下显著优于传统PID控制，验证了其对于LTA飞行中干扰感知的有效性。

Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.

Abstract: Scaling data volume and diversity is critical for generalizing embodied intelligence. While synthetic data generation offers a scalable alternative to expensive physical data acquisition, existing pipelines remain fragmented and task-specific. This isolation leads to significant engineering inefficiency and system instability, failing to support the sustained, high-throughput data generation required for foundation model training. To address these challenges, we present Nimbus, a unified synthetic data generation framework designed to integrate heterogeneous navigation and manipulation pipelines. Nimbus introduces a modular four-layer architecture featuring a decoupled execution model that separates trajectory planning, rendering, and storage into asynchronous stages. By implementing dynamic pipeline scheduling, global load balancing, distributed fault tolerance, and backend-specific rendering optimizations, the system maximizes resource utilization across CPU, GPU, and I/O resources. Our evaluation demonstrates that Nimbus achieves a 2-3X improvement in end-to-end throughput compared to unoptimized baselines and ensuring robust, long-term operation in large-scale distributed environments. This framework serves as the production backbone for the InternData suite, enabling seamless cross-domain data synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems -- even including a hybrid system -- and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.

Conclusion: HPTune框架通过结合快速和慢速调优层级，实现了高效的MPC参数调整，并在复杂环境中优于多种基准方案，实现了安全、敏捷的避障策略。

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.

TL;DR: Off-policy SAC with large-batch updates enables efficient humanoid pretraining, and model-based methods allow safe adaptation, combining simulation efficiency with sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms and the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient fine-tuning in humanoid control.

Method: The paper uses off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with large-batch updates and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for pretraining, followed by model-based methods for fine-tuning in new environments.

Result: The method achieves zero-shot deployment on real robots and demonstrates effective adaptation to new environments and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines the efficiency of large-scale simulation pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning, enabling safe adaptation to new environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires reliable execution under diverse conditions, yet many state-of-the-art systems still struggle with high-dimensional action spaces, sparse rewards, and slow generalization beyond carefully curated training scenarios. We study these limitations through the example of grasping in space environments. We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.

Conclusion: DSCD-Nav通过双立场合作辩论和证据感知仲裁机制，显著提升了室内导航的成功率和路径效率，同时减少了探索冗余。

Abstract: Adaptive navigation in unfamiliar indoor environments is crucial for household service robots. Despite advances in zero-shot perception and reasoning from vision-language models, existing navigation systems still rely on single-pass scoring at the decision layer, leading to overconfident long-horizon errors and redundant exploration. To tackle these problems, we propose Dual-Stance Cooperative Debate Navigation (DSCD-Nav), a decision mechanism that replaces one-shot scoring with stance-based cross-checking and evidence-aware arbitration to improve action reliability under partial observability. Specifically, given the same observation and candidate action set, we explicitly construct two stances by conditioning the evaluation on diverse and complementary objectives: a Task-Scene Understanding (TSU) stance that prioritizes goal progress from scene-layout cues, and a Safety-Information Balancing (SIB) stance that emphasizes risk and information value. The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments. Then, a Navigation Consensus Arbitration (NCA) agent is employed to consolidate both sides' reasons and evidence, optionally triggering lightweight micro-probing to verify uncertain choices, preserving NCA's primary intent while disambiguating. Experiments on HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D demonstrate consistent improvements in success and path efficiency while reducing exploration redundancy.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个框架，将李群积分器与标准运动方程（EOM）公式接口，并展示了如何在绝对坐标中一致地融入刚体运动的几何特性。

Abstract: A classical approach to the multibody systems (MBS) modeling is to use absolute coordinates, i.e., a set of (possibly redundant) coordinates that describe the absolute position and orientation of the individual bodies with respect to an inertial frame (IFR). A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.

TL;DR: SBOCR (Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations) outperform traditional global and dense features in robotic manipulation tasks, offering better generalization under visual changes like lighting and distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual representations (global and dense features) mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts. This work explores SBOCR as an intermediate structured alternative to improve generalization.

Method: The study benchmarks global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations (SBOCR) across simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, evaluating their performance under various visual conditions like lighting changes, texture variations, and distractors.

Result: SBOCR-based policies outperform other representations in generalization settings, showing robustness to visual changes without requiring task-specific pretraining.

Conclusion: SBOCR-based policies demonstrate superior generalization capabilities compared to dense and global representation-based policies, even without task-specific pretraining, making them a promising approach for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of robotic manipulation policies are heavily influenced by the choice of visual representations. Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining. These insights suggest that SBOCR is a promising direction for designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world robotic environments.

Abstract: 4D radar has emerged as a critical sensor for autonomous driving, primarily due to its enhanced capabilities in elevation measurement and higher resolution compared to traditional 3D radar. Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.

Abstract: For contact-intensive tasks, the ability to generate policies that produce comprehensive tactile-aware motions is essential. However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%. These results underscore that learning multi-dimensional tactile priors from human demonstrations is critical for achieving robust, human-like dexterous manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Abstract: Occluded traffic agents pose a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles, as hidden pedestrians or vehicles can appear unexpectedly, yet this problem remains understudied. Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.

Conclusion: IROS框架通过结合快速反射决策和慢速深思熟虑推理，显著提升了室内移动机器人导航的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Indoor mobile robot navigation requires fast responsiveness and robust semantic understanding, yet existing methods struggle to provide both. Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.

Abstract: Air hockey demands split-second decisions at high puck velocities, a challenge we address with a compact network of spiking neurons running on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor. By co-designing hardware and learning algorithms, we train the system to achieve successful puck interactions through reinforcement learning in a remarkably small number of trials. The network leverages fixed random connectivity to capture the task's temporal structure and adopts a local e-prop learning rule in the readout layer to exploit event-driven activity for fast and efficient learning. The result is real-time learning with a setup comprising a computer and the neuromorphic chip in-the-loop, enabling practical training of spiking neural networks for robotic autonomous systems. This work bridges neuroscience-inspired hardware with real-world robotic control, showing that brain-inspired approaches can tackle fast-paced interaction tasks while supporting always-on learning in intelligent machines.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in ground-based embodied intelligence, their application to Aerial Manipulation Systems (AMS) remains a largely unexplored frontier. The inherent characteristics of AMS, including floating-base dynamics, strong coupling between the UAV and the manipulator, and the multi-step, long-horizon nature of operational tasks, pose severe challenges to existing VLA paradigms designed for static or 2D mobile bases. To bridge this gap, we propose AIR-VLA, the first VLA benchmark specifically tailored for aerial manipulation. We construct a physics-based simulation environment and release a high-quality multimodal dataset comprising 3000 manually teleoperated demonstrations, covering base manipulation, object & spatial understanding, semantic reasoning, and long-horizon planning. Leveraging this platform, we systematically evaluate mainstream VLA models and state-of-the-art VLM models. Our experiments not only validate the feasibility of transferring VLA paradigms to aerial systems but also, through multi-dimensional metrics tailored to aerial tasks, reveal the capabilities and boundaries of current models regarding UAV mobility, manipulator control, and high-level planning. AIR-VLA establishes a standardized testbed and data foundation for future research in general-purpose aerial robotics.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的声音触发移动操作框架和Habitat-Echo数据平台显著提升了机器人在动态环境中的自主性和反应能力，无需依赖预设指令。

Abstract: Current mobile manipulation research predominantly follows an instruction-driven paradigm, where agents rely on predefined textual commands to execute tasks. However, this setting confines agents to a passive role, limiting their autonomy and ability to react to dynamic environmental events. To address these limitations, we introduce sound-triggered mobile manipulation, where agents must actively perceive and interact with sound-emitting objects without explicit action instructions. To support these tasks, we develop Habitat-Echo, a data platform that integrates acoustic rendering with physical interaction. We further propose a baseline comprising a high-level task planner and low-level policy models to complete these tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed baseline empowers agents to actively detect and respond to auditory events, eliminating the need for case-by-case instructions. Notably, in the challenging dual-source scenario, the agent successfully isolates the primary source from overlapping acoustic interference to execute the first interaction, and subsequently proceeds to manipulate the secondary object, verifying the robustness of the baseline.

Conclusion: CoFreeVLA通过引入短期自碰撞风险估计器，显著减少了双臂操作中的自碰撞，提高了任务成功率。

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models enable instruction following manipulation, yet dualarm deployment remains unsafe due to under modeled selfcollisions between arms and grasped objects. We introduce CoFreeVLA, which augments an endtoend VLA with a short horizon selfcollision risk estimator that predicts collision likelihood from proprioception, visual embeddings, and planned actions. The estimator gates risky commands, recovers to safe states via risk-guided adjustments, and shapes policy refinement for safer rollouts. It is pre-trained with model-based collision labels and posttrained on real robot rollouts for calibration. On five bimanual tasks with the PiPER robot arm, CoFreeVLA reduces selfcollisions and improves success rates versus RDT and APEX.

Abstract: Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.

Abstract: This article describes GAZELOAD, a multimodal dataset for mental workload estimation in industrial human-robot collaboration. The data were collected in a laboratory assembly testbed where 26 participants interacted with two collaborative robots (UR5 and Franka Emika Panda) while wearing Meta ARIA smart glasses. The dataset time-synchronizes eye-tracking signals (pupil diameter, fixations, saccades, eye gaze, gaze transition entropy, fixation dispersion index) with environmental real-time and continuous measurements (illuminance) and task and robot context (bench, task block, induced faults), under controlled manipulations of task difficulty and ambient conditions. For each participant and workload-graded task block, we provide CSV files with ocular metrics aggregated into 250 ms windows, environmental logs, and self-reported mental workload ratings on a 1-10 Likert scale, organized in participant-specific folders alongside documentation. These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.

Abstract: Hybrid planner switching framework (HPSF) for autonomous driving needs to reconcile high-speed driving efficiency with safe maneuvering in dense traffic. Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS). High-fidelity simulation results show that the proposed LAP outperforms other benchmarks in terms of both driving time and success rate.

Abstract: Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.

Abstract: Imitation learning has achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, yet its application to surgical robotics remains challenging due to data scarcity, constrained workspaces, and the need for an exceptional level of safety and predictability. We present a supervised Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed for phase-structured surgical manipulation tasks, which can be added on top of any autonomous policy. Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions. Notably, it generalizes to unseen testing viewpoints and also transfers zero-shot to ex vivo porcine tissue without additional training, offering a promising pathway toward in vivo deployment. To support this, we present qualitative preliminary results of policy roll-outs during in vivo porcine surgery.

Abstract: Foldable robots have been an active area of robotics research due to their high volume-to-mass ratio, easy packability, and shape adaptability. For locomotion, previously developed foldable robots have either embedded linear actuators in, or attached non-folding rotary motors to, their structure. Further, those actuators directly embedded in the structure of the folding medium all contributed to linear or folding motion, not to continuous rotary motion. On the macro-scale there has not yet been a folding continuous rotary actuator. This paper details the development and testing of the first macro-scale origami rotary motor that can be folded flat, and then unfurled to operate. Using corona discharge for torque production, the prototype motor achieved an expansion ratio of 2.5:1, reached a top speed of 1440 rpm when driven at -29 kV, and exhibited a maximum output torque over 0.15 mN m with an active component torque density of 0.04 Nm/kg.

Conclusion: PocketDP3通过轻量化的Diffusion Mixer（DiM）架构显著减少了模型参数量，同时在性能和推理速度上优于现有方法，展示了在实际应用中的高效性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Recently, 3D vision-based diffusion policies have shown strong capability in learning complex robotic manipulation skills. However, a common architectural mismatch exists in these models: a tiny yet efficient point-cloud encoder is often paired with a massive decoder. Given a compact scene representation, we argue that this may lead to substantial parameter waste in the decoder. Motivated by this observation, we propose PocketDP3, a pocket-scale 3D diffusion policy that replaces the heavy conditional U-Net decoder used in prior methods with a lightweight Diffusion Mixer (DiM) built on MLP-Mixer blocks. This architecture enables efficient fusion across temporal and channel dimensions, significantly reducing model size. Notably, without any additional consistency distillation techniques, our method supports two-step inference without sacrificing performance, improving practicality for real-time deployment. Across three simulation benchmarks--RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld--PocketDP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer than 1% of the parameters of prior methods, while also accelerating inference. Real-world experiments further demonstrate the practicality and transferability of our method in real-world settings. Code will be released.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种健康到中风的sEMG意图检测适应方法，显著提高了中风患者的意图检测准确率，减少了校准负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面肌电图（sEMG）是中风后手部康复的有前景的控制信号，但从瘫痪肌肉中检测意图通常需要冗长的特定受试者校准，并且对变异性脆弱。

Method: 提出了一个健康到中风的适应流程，该流程从大规模健康人sEMG预训练的模型初始化意图检测器，然后仅使用少量特定受试者数据进行微调。

Result: 健康预训练的适应方法在各种条件下均优于零样本迁移和中风专用训练，最佳适应方法将平均过渡准确率从0.42提高到0.61，原始准确率从0.69提高到0.78。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过迁移可重复使用的健康领域EMG表示，可以降低校准负担，同时提高实时中风后意图检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a promising control signal for assist-as-needed hand rehabilitation after stroke, but detecting intent from paretic muscles often requires lengthy, subject-specific calibration and remains brittle to variability. We propose a healthy-to-stroke adaptation pipeline that initializes an intent detector from a model pretrained on large-scale able-bodied sEMG, then fine-tunes it for each stroke participant using only a small amount of subject-specific data. Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78. These results suggest that transferring a reusable healthy-domain EMG representation can reduce calibration burden while improving robustness for real-time post-stroke intent detection.

TL;DR: DynamicVLA 是一个整合时间推理和闭环适应的框架，通过三种设计提升动态物体操作的性能，并引入 DOM 基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 VLA 模型在动态场景中因快速感知、时间预测和连续控制需求而表现不佳的问题。

Method: DynamicVLA 通过三种关键设计实现动态物体操作：1) 紧凑的 0.4B VLA 模型，使用卷积视觉编码器进行高效多模态推理；2) 连续推理，实现重叠推理与执行以降低延迟；3) 潜在感知动作流，通过时间对齐执行弥合感知与执行的差距。此外，还引入了 DOM 基准数据集。

Result: 实验评估显示 DynamicVLA 在响应速度、感知和泛化能力方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: DynamicVLA 作为一个统一的框架，在动态物体操作中展现了显著的响应速度、感知和泛化能力的提升。

Abstract: Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.

TL;DR: LLMs enhance software maintainability and evolvability but introduce risks like hallucinations and unstable outputs, requiring safeguards and oversight for responsible use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically examine how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems, identifying quality attributes addressed, positive impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies in existing research.

Method: A systematic literature review was conducted, analyzing 87 primary studies from ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024). Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process, with attributes analyzed descriptively and impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation.

Result: LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability.

Conclusion: LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability. Responsible adoption requires safeguards, rigorous evaluation, and structured human oversight.

Abstract: Context. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing. Empirical studies report productivity gains, improved comprehension, and reduced cognitive load. However, evidence remains fragmented, and concerns persist about hallucinations, unstable outputs, methodological limitations, and emerging forms of technical debt. How these mixed effects shape long-term software maintainability and evolvability remains unclear. Objectives. This study systematically examines how LLMs influence the maintainability and evolvability of software systems. We identify which quality attributes are addressed in existing research, the positive impacts LLMs provide, the risks and weaknesses they introduce, and the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. Method. We conducted a systematic literature review. Searches across ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2020 to 2024) yielded 87 primary studies. Qualitative evidence was extracted through a calibrated multi-researcher process. Attributes were analyzed descriptively, while impacts, risks, weaknesses, and mitigation strategies were synthesized using a hybrid thematic approach supported by an LLM-assisted analysis tool with human-in-the-loop validation. Results. LLMs provide benefits such as improved analyzability, testability, code comprehension, debugging support, and automated repair. However, they also introduce risks, including hallucinated or incorrect outputs, brittleness to context, limited domain reasoning, unstable performance, and flaws in current evaluations, which threaten long-term evolvability. Conclusion. LLMs can strengthen maintainability and evolvability, but they also pose nontrivial risks to long-term sustainability. Responsible adoption requires safeguards, rigorous evaluation, and structured human oversight.

TL;DR: DevOps-Gym是首个评估AI代理在DevOps全周期能力的基准测试，发现现有模型在多项任务中表现不足，需进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注孤立问题，缺乏DevOps环境和工具接口，无法全面评估AI代理在全软件DevOps周期中的能力。

Method: 引入了DevOps-Gym，一个包含700+个真实任务的端到端基准测试，覆盖Java和Go的30+个项目，采用半自动化数据收集机制确保任务覆盖和质量。

Result: 评估显示，现有最先进模型在Java和Go的问题解决和测试生成中表现不佳，且无法处理监控和构建配置等新任务。

Conclusion: AI agents目前在全软件DevOps周期中的能力存在显著局限，尤其是在问题解决和测试生成方面，需要进一步研究以实现自动化。

Abstract: Even though demonstrating extraordinary capabilities in code generation and software issue resolving, AI agents' capabilities in the full software DevOps cycle are still unknown. Different from pure code generation, handling the DevOps cycle in real-world software, including developing, deploying, and managing, requires analyzing large-scale projects, understanding dynamic program behaviors, leveraging domain-specific tools, and making sequential decisions. However, existing benchmarks focus on isolated problems and lack environments and tool interfaces for DevOps. We introduce DevOps-Gym, the first end-to-end benchmark for evaluating AI agents across core DevOps workflows: build and configuration, monitoring, issue resolving, and test generation. DevOps-Gym includes 700+ real-world tasks collected from 30+ projects in Java and Go. We develop a semi-automated data collection mechanism with rigorous and non-trivial expert efforts in ensuring the task coverage and quality. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models and agents reveals fundamental limitations: they struggle with issue resolving and test generation in Java and Go, and remain unable to handle new tasks such as monitoring and build and configuration. These results highlight the need for essential research in automating the full DevOps cycle with AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理作为工程协作伙伴的能力，反映开发者日常工作中的任务如功能实现、bug修复、重构和性能优化。

Method: 采用Docker化测试工具，提供代码库搜索、结构化文件编辑和全栈应用测试工具，模拟AI原生IDE环境。

Result: 创建了80个任务，覆盖8个未公开的C/C++、Java和MERN技术栈仓库，验证代理在项目级修改中的意图与成功关联。

Conclusion: IDE-Bench是首个在多语言、全栈环境下系统评估AI IDE代理在真实软件开发任务中表现的框架，通过未公开代码库确保数据无污染。

Abstract: IDE-Bench is a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI IDE agents on real-world software engineering tasks through an IDE-native tool interface. We present a Dockerized test harness that goes beyond raw terminal execution, granting models a structured tool ecosystem that represents AI-native IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. By providing high-level abstractions for codebase search, structured file editing, and tools for testing full-stack applications, IDE-Bench evaluates an agent's ability to act as a true engineering collaborator. For evaluation and to prevent training data contamination, we created 80 tasks across eight never-published repositories spanning C/C++, Java, and MERN stacks, representing modern tech stack production scenarios, including feature implementation, bug fixing, refactoring, and performance optimization that mirror daily developer workflows in private codebases. Our benchmark is the first to systematically correlate agent-reported intent with successful project-level modifications in a multi-language, full-stack environment on completely uncontaminated code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现软件工程领域SLRs存在重复和重叠问题，常见论证模式包括覆盖空白、方法局限、时间过时和技术进步。建议通过识别现有SLRs和合理论证来减少重复工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解作者如何论证对某一主题进行额外SLRs的合理性，以减少软件工程研究中重复和重叠的SLRs现象。

Method: 通过定性内容分析18篇已发表的SLRs，识别常见的论证模式，并结合引用数据、出版年份、出版场所及SLRs质量解读结果。

Result: 常见的论证模式包括作者声称覆盖范围存在空白、先前研究的方法学局限性、先前SLRs的时间过时性，或技术和方法学的快速进步需要更新的综合。

Conclusion: 通过对一个相当狭窄主题的深入分析，为软件工程领域的系统文献综述（SLRs）提供了普遍见解。通过强调在设计及评审指南中识别现有SLRs并合理进行进一步SLRs的必要性，以及作为会议和期刊的政策，可以减少重复工作的可能性并提高该领域的进展速度。

Abstract: Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.

TL;DR: 利用生成式AI部分自动化DDD中的元模型生成，显著提升效率并降低资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DDD中元模型由系统设计者手动创建，过程耗时且资源密集。本研究探索利用生成式AI部分自动化这一过程，以提升效率。

Method: 通过使用4位量化的Code Llama模型和低秩适应（LoRA）技术，在消费级GPU上微调AI模型，生成领域特定的JSON对象。

Result: 模型在有限硬件条件下表现优异，生成的JSON对象语法正确且需极少后处理。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了生成式AI在领域驱动设计（DDD）中部分自动化生成元模型的可行性，显著提高了设计效率并降低了资源需求，为AI驱动的软件开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a key framework for developing customer-oriented software, focusing on the precise modeling of an application's domain. Traditionally, metamodels that describe these domains are created manually by system designers, forming the basis for iterative software development. This paper explores the partial automation of metamodel generation using generative AI, particularly for producing domain-specific JSON objects. By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Despite limited hardware, the model achieved high performance, generating accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing. This research illustrates the viability of incorporating generative AI into the DDD process, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements, while also laying the groundwork for further advancements in AI-driven software development.

TL;DR: 区块链和AI结合可增强软件工程中的信任，但信任定义不一致和实际测试不足是挑战。未来需开发可衡量的信任框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链和AI在提升软件工程（SE）中的信任度方面日益受到关注，尤其是在支持软件演化任务中。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述（SLR），使用预定义的协议和明确的资格标准以确保透明度、可重复性和最小化偏差，综合研究了区块链在AI驱动的软件工程工具和流程中如何增强信任。

Result: 大多数研究集中于AI在SE中的应用，仅31%明确涉及信任问题。综述突出了六项近期研究，探索基于区块链的方法以增强AI辅助SE任务中的可靠性、透明度和问责制。

Conclusion: Blockchain通过确保数据的不可变性、模型的透明性和生命周期的可追溯性来增强信任，包括联邦学习与区块链共识及私有数据验证。然而，对信任的不一致定义和有限的现实测试仍是主要挑战。未来工作需开发可衡量、可复现的信任框架，以实现可靠、安全且合规的AI驱动软件工程生态系统，包括涉及大型语言模型的应用。

Abstract: Context: Blockchain and AI are increasingly explored to enhance trustworthiness in software engineering (SE), particularly in supporting software evolution tasks. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges. Future work must develop measurable, reproducible trust frameworks to enable reliable, secure, and compliant AI-driven SE ecosystems, including applications involving large language models.

Method: 通过有针对性的范围审查，提取并综合了现有研究的定义、纳入标准、分析单元和识别启发式，构建了一个统一的分类法，并在研究软件百科全书（RSE）的大规模语料库上进行了操作化。

Result: 生成了一个注释数据集、标签代码本和可重复的标签管道，并应用OpenSSF Scorecard进行初步安全分析，展示了不同分类法定义集群中存储库中心安全信号的差异。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个面向研究软件供应链（RSSC）的分类法，并展示了其在安全分析中的应用，强调了分类法在解释RSSC安全测量中的必要性。

Abstract: Empirical studies of research software are hard to compare because the literature operationalizes ``research software'' inconsistently. Motivated by the research software supply chain (RSSC) and its security risks, we introduce an RSSC-oriented taxonomy that makes scope and operational boundaries explicit for empirical research software security studies.
  We conduct a targeted scoping review of recent repository mining and dataset construction studies, extracting each work's definition, inclusion criteria, unit of analysis, and identification heuristics. We synthesize these into a harmonized taxonomy and a mapping that translates prior approaches into shared taxonomy dimensions. We operationalize the taxonomy on a large community-curated corpus from the Research Software Encyclopedia (RSE), producing an annotated dataset, a labeling codebook, and a reproducible labeling pipeline. Finally, we apply OpenSSF Scorecard as a preliminary security analysis to show how repository-centric security signals differ across taxonomy-defined clusters and why taxonomy-aware stratification is necessary for interpreting RSSC security measurements.

Method: 结合对现有基准测试的深入调查和社区研讨会的见解，识别出三个核心障碍，并基于这些发现开发了BEHELM。

Result: BEHELM提供了一个结构化方法来评估模型在不同任务、语言、输入输出粒度及关键质量维度上的表现。

Conclusion: BEHELM被提出作为一个全面的基准测试基础设施，旨在通过统一软件场景规范和多维度评估，解决当前评估大型语言模型在代码领域中的核心障碍。

Abstract: Large language models for code are advancing fast, yet our ability to evaluate them lags behind. Current benchmarks focus on narrow tasks and single metrics, which hide critical gaps in robustness, interpretability, fairness, efficiency, and real-world usability. They also suffer from inconsistent data engineering practices, limited software engineering context, and widespread contamination issues. To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop. We identified three core barriers to reliable evaluation: the absence of software-engineering-rich datasets, overreliance on ML-centric metrics, and the lack of standardized, reproducible data pipelines. Building on these findings, we introduce BEHELM, a holistic benchmarking infrastructure that unifies software-scenario specification with multi-metric evaluation. BEHELM provides a structured way to assess models across tasks, languages, input and output granularities, and key quality dimensions. Our goal is to reduce the overhead currently required to construct benchmarks while enabling a fair, realistic, and future-proof assessment of LLMs in software engineering.

Abstract: We present the first empirical study of AI-generated pull requests that are 'silent,' meaning no comments or discussions accompany them. This absence of any comments or discussions associated with such silent AI pull requests (SPRs) poses a unique challenge in understanding the rationale for their acceptance or rejection. Hence, we quantitatively study 4,762 SPRs of five AI agents made to popular Python repositories drawn from the AIDev public dataset. We examine SPRs impact on code complexity, other quality issues, and security vulnerabilities, especially to determine whether these insights can hint at the rationale for acceptance or rejection of SPRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM编码助手生成决策的速度快于团队验证速度，缺乏区分推测与已验证知识的机制，导致信任膨胀和证据过期问题。

Method: 通过形式化三个核心要求（认知层、保守的保证聚合、自动化证据衰减跟踪）并基于模糊逻辑定义聚合语义，提出了FPF框架。

Result: 在两个内部项目的回顾性审计中，应用FPF标准发现20-25%的架构决策在两个月内证据过时，验证了时间问责的必要性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了‘第一原则框架’（FPF），旨在通过明确的认知层、保守的保证聚合和自动化证据衰减跟踪，实现负责任的人工智能辅助软件工程。

Abstract: This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the Gödel t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures. We formalize these requirements as the First Principles Framework (FPF), ground its aggregation semantics in fuzzy logic, and define a quintet of invariants that any valid aggregation operator must satisfy. Our retrospective audit applying FPF criteria to two internal projects found that 20-25% of architectural decisions had stale evidence within two months, validating the need for temporal accountability. We outline research directions including learnable aggregation operators, federated evidence sharing, and SMT-based claim validation.

TL;DR: TypeScript的静态类型减少了传统错误，但增加了构建系统和工具链的故障，研究揭示了其在大规模系统中的故障特征变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TypeScript已成为现代Web开发的流行语言，但其对软件故障的影响仍知之甚少。

Method: 分析了16个流行开源仓库中的633个错误报告，构建了故障类型的分类法，并量化了它们的普遍性及其与项目特征（如大小、领域和依赖组成）的关系。

Result: 研究发现故障主要由工具和配置错误、API误用以及异步错误处理问题主导，这些类别与构建复杂性和依赖异构性密切相关。

Conclusion: TypeScript的静态类型虽然减少了传统的运行时和类型错误，但将脆弱性转移到了构建系统和工具链上，揭示了语言设计和生态系统演化如何重塑大规模软件系统的故障特征。

Abstract: TypeScript has rapidly become a popular language for modern web development, yet its effect on software faults remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains. These findings offer new insight into how language design and ecosystem evolution reshape the fault profiles of large-scale software systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类-AI代理协作在软件测试中的角色，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过AIDev数据集中的6,582个HAPRs和3,122个HPRs，从测试频率与范围、测试相关变更类型（代码-测试协同演化vs.测试专注）、测试质量（通过测试异味衡量）三个维度进行对比分析。

Result: HAPRs与HPRs在包含测试的几率相近（42.9% vs. 40.0%），但HAPRs的测试范围更大（测试-源代码行比例近乎翻倍）。HAPRs更倾向于在协同演化中新增测试（OR=1.79），而HPRs更侧重修改现有测试。测试异味类别虽有统计差异，但效应量微小，质量无实质区别。

Conclusion: AI-based coding agents与人类开发者协作在软件测试实践中的影响首次被系统表征，尽管测试质量无显著差异，但HAPRs在测试范围和新增测试方面表现更积极。

Abstract: AI-based coding agents are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, collaborating with developers to create pull requests (PRs). Despite their growing adoption, the role of human-agent collaboration in software testing remains poorly understood. This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality. These insights provide the first characterization of how human-agent collaboration shapes testing practices.

TL;DR: CovAgent利用AI代理分析应用代码并生成动态脚本，显著提升Android应用UI测试的覆盖率，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI测试技术在覆盖率上存在局限，难以达到30%以上的活动覆盖率，主要由于复杂用户输入生成失败、设备配置和外部资源的激活条件不满足，以及难以通过GUI访问的代码路径。

Method: CovAgent是一个与模糊测试无关的框架，包含两个AI代理：一个分析应用的Smali代码和组件转换图，推理未满足的激活条件；另一个生成动态插桩脚本以满足这些条件。

Result: CovAgent显著提升了测试覆盖率，相比现有技术（如LLMDroid、Fastbot和APE），活动覆盖率分别提高了101.1%、116.3%和179.7%，并在其他指标上也优于基线。

Conclusion: CovAgent通过AI代理增强现有模糊测试方法，显著提高了Android应用UI测试的覆盖率，包括活动、类、方法和行覆盖率，并展示了Agentic AI在自动化应用测试领域的潜力。

Abstract: Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.

Motivation: 填补系统性职场偏见在软件工程领域的研究空白，揭示其对工程师的具体影响。

Method: 采用基于情景的问卷调查方法，应用社会认同理论（SIT）分析四种偏见形式。

Result: 职业发展和任务选择偏见最为普遍，女性遭受偏见的概率是男性的三倍以上，少数族裔则更容易遭受身份攻击。其他因素如年龄、经验等也显著影响偏见受害率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，职场偏见对软件工程师的影响显著，尤其是在职业发展和任务分配方面。女性及少数族裔群体更容易遭受偏见，且年龄、经验、组织规模和地理位置也是重要预测因素。

Abstract: While systemic workplace bias is well-documented in non-computing fields, its specific impact on software engineers remains poorly understood. This study addresses that gap by applying Social Identity Theory (SIT) to investigate four distinct forms of bias: lack of career development, stereotyped task selection, unwelcoming environments, and identity attacks. Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks. Our analysis also confirms that, beyond gender and race, factors such as age, years of experience, organization size, and geographic location are significant predictors of bias victimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标仅衡量通过率，无法反映LLM代理对长期可维护性和代码质量的影响。

Method: 通过代码度量和开发者反应分析PR特性，评估LLM生成的代码质量与可维护性。

Result: LLM代理常忽视代码复用，冗余度高于人类开发者；评审者对AI生成代码情绪更中性或积极。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLM代理在代码生成中虽提高效率，但可能导致技术债务的无声积累，需改进人机协作方式。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents are advancing quickly, with the increasing leveraging of LLM Agents to assist in development tasks such as code generation. While LLM Agents accelerate code generation, studies indicate they may introduce adverse effects on development. However, existing metrics solely measure pass rates, failing to reflect impacts on long-term maintainability and readability, and failing to capture human intuitive evaluations of PR. To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers. In contrast to the quality issues, our emotions analysis reveals that reviewers tend to express more neutral or positive emotions towards AI-generated contributions than human ones. This disconnect suggests that the surface-level plausibility of AI code masks redundancy, leading to the silent accumulation of technical debt in real-world development environments. Our research provides insights for improving human-AI collaboration.

*Beomsu Koh,Neil Walkinshaw,Donghwan Shin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用小型语言模型（SLM）检测Git提交中多个语义关注点的可行性，发现微调后的14B参数SLM在单关注点下与LLM相当，最多三个关注点仍有效，且提交消息能显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实践中开发者常将多个关注点捆绑到纠缠提交中，模糊了意图并增加了维护难度。现有研究虽用CCS和LMs捕捉提交意图，但未解决涉及多关注点的纠缠提交问题，因此探讨LMs在多关注点检测中的可行性。

Method: 将多关注点检测问题构建为多标签分类任务，并基于真实数据构建了一个人工纠缠提交的控制数据集。通过实证研究，使用SLM检测纠缠提交中的多个语义关注点，考察了微调、关注点数量、提交消息包含及在实用令牌预算限制下的头部保留截断的影响。

Result: 微调的14B参数SLM在单关注点提交中与LLM竞争，最多三个关注点下仍有效。包含提交消息显著提升检测准确率（44%），且延迟影响极小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过微调的14B参数小型语言模型（SLM）在单关注点提交中与最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）表现相当，并且在最多三个关注点的情况下仍可使用。提交消息的包含将检测准确率提高了44%（以汉明损失衡量），且延迟开销可忽略，证实了其作为重要语义线索的价值。

Abstract: Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.

TL;DR: 生成式AI工具的频繁使用与开发者生产力和代码质量提升正相关，形成良性循环，但安全顾虑和测试工具采用滞后是主要挑战。组织采用过程遵循创新扩散理论，政策作为成熟度标志而非直接驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在软件开发中的快速应用，本研究旨在探讨其对开发者实践感知的影响，特别是生产力和代码质量的关系，以及开发者对AI工具的采用意愿和障碍。

Method: 本研究通过对147名专业开发者的使用模式进行实证调查，分析了AI工具使用的感知相关性、生产力和质量结果，以及开发者对新兴AI增强开发的准备情况。

Result: 研究发现，AI工具的频繁和广泛使用与感知生产力（PP）和代码质量（PQ）提升呈最强正相关，其中使用频率的影响最大。安全顾虑是采用的主要障碍，测试工具的采用滞后于编码工具。开发者可分为三类（热情者、实用主义者、谨慎者），其采用行为符合创新扩散理论。

Conclusion: 研究表明，生成式AI工具的广泛和频繁使用与开发者的生产力和代码质量感知提升呈正相关，形成了一种良性采用循环。然而，安全顾虑仍是采用的主要障碍，且测试工具的采用滞后于编码工具。组织采用AI工具的过程遵循创新扩散理论，其中'热情者'推动采用，'实用主义者'随后跟进，而'谨慎者'则因缺乏早期采用者示范而停滞不前。政策本身不直接预测个人使用意图，但标志着组织成熟度。

Abstract: The rapid advance of Generative AI into software development prompts this empirical investigation of perceptual effects on practice. We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模工业数据分析开发者对AI代码建议的接受度，提出CSAP预测模型，显著提升准确性并减少开发者中断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然对开发者与AI的交互进行了定性探索，但在开发者对AI生成代码建议接受度的定量分析方面存在显著空白，部分原因是细粒度的交互数据通常是专有的。

Method: 本文通过分析66,329个工业开发者与AI的交互数据，识别了被接受和被拒绝代码建议之间的显著差异特征，并提出了CSAP（代码建议接受预测）模型。

Result: CSAP模型在非平衡和平衡数据集上的准确率分别达到0.973和0.922，相较于大型语言模型基准和工业过滤器，相对提升了12.6%和69.5%（非平衡数据集）以及87.0%和140.1%（平衡数据集）。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，针对性的个性化是过滤掉预测会被拒绝的代码建议并减少开发者中断的有效方法。这是首次基于大规模工业数据对代码建议接受度进行定量研究，也为AI辅助编程的重要研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: AI-assisted programming tools are widely adopted, yet their practical utility is often undermined by undesired suggestions that interrupt developer workflows and cause frustration. While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\% and 69.5\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\% and 140.1\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming.

Method: 提出了DebateCoder，一个多智能体协作框架，包括结构化角色扮演协议（三个智能体：用户代理、技术代理和质量保证代理）、自适应置信门控机制（95%阈值）、多轮审议模块和评审引导的分析调试循环。

Conclusion: 协作协议可以缓解小参数模型的局限性，为高质量自动化软件工程提供可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed breakthroughs in automated code generation, Small Language Models (SLMs) often encounter reasoning bottlenecks and failure loops when addressing complex logical requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose DebateCoder, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to improve the reasoning ability of SLMs (e.g., Pangu-1B) in resource-constrained environments. DebateCoder uses a structured role-playing protocol with three agents: User Agent (A_UA), Technical Agent (A_TA), and Quality Assurance Agent (A_QA). It also includes an Adaptive Confidence Gating mechanism with a 95% threshold to balance accuracy and inference efficiency. In addition, we introduce a multi-turn deliberation module and a reviewer-guided analytical debugging loop for orthogonal pre-generation debate and post-generation refinement. Experiments on HumanEval and MBPP show that DebateCoder achieves 70.12% Pass@1 on HumanEval, outperforming MapCoder while reducing API overhead by about 35%. These results indicate that collaborative protocols can mitigate limitations of small-parameter models and provide a scalable, efficient approach to high-quality automated software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具依赖运行时技术，无法检测输入依赖的OOB和分配内OOB，导致安全漏洞被忽视。SCuBA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: SCuBA通过分析CPU和GPU代码中的语义关系（以约束形式表达），并利用SAT求解器检查任何输入下是否存在OOB访问。同时，它还跟踪内存分配的逻辑分区以检测分配内OOB。

Result: 与NVIDIA的Compute Sanitizer相比，SCuBA在20个程序中检测出所有45个隐蔽内存漏洞，且无漏报或误报。

Conclusion: SCuBA是一种创新的编译时技术，能够有效检测GPU程序中的内存安全漏洞，包括输入依赖的越界访问（OOB）和分配内OOB，且无漏报和误报。

Abstract: Memory safety bugs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB) in GPU programs, can compromise the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.
  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种多目标整数线性规划模型，旨在通过提取方法重构来降低代码的认知复杂度，并开发了相关算法和工具以验证模型的有效性。

Abstract: Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注生成 RPC 方法调用来测试区块链客户端，但忽略了生成能够触发上下文相关 RPC 漏洞的适当上下文。

Method: EthCRAFT 通过探索区块链客户端的状态转移程序空间生成交易以构建上下文，并设计上下文感知的 RPC 方法调用生成方法。

Conclusion: EthCRAFT 在检测区块链客户端 RPC 漏洞方面表现出色，不仅发现了六个新漏洞，还获得了以太坊基金会的漏洞奖励。

Abstract: Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.
  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates. Three of our bug reports have been offered a vulnerability bounty by the Ethereum Foundation.

Abstract: In recent years, mobile applications have become indispensable tools for managing various aspects of life. From enhancing productivity to providing personalized entertainment, mobile apps have revolutionized people's daily routines. Despite this rapid growth and popularity, gaps remain in how these apps address the needs of users from different age groups. Users of varying ages face distinct challenges when interacting with mobile apps, from younger users dealing with inappropriate content to older users having difficulty with usability due to age-related vision and cognition impairments. Although there have been initiatives to create age-inclusive apps, a limited understanding of user perspectives on age-related issues may hinder developers from recognizing specific challenges and implementing effective solutions. In this study, we explore age discussions in app reviews to gain insights into how mobile apps should cater to users across different age groups.We manually curated a dataset of 4,163 app reviews from the Google Play Store and identified 1,429 age-related reviews and 2,734 non-age-related reviews. We employed eight machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to automatically detect age discussions, with RoBERTa performing the best, achieving a precision of 92.46%. Additionally, a qualitative analysis of the 1,429 age-related reviews uncovers six dominant themes reflecting user concerns.

Motivation: 现有的神经元编辑缓解策略在处理背门攻击和不公平性问题时缺乏灵活性且易扭曲特征表示，受软件工程中增量调试和热补丁的启发，提出了AtPatch方法。

Method: AtPatch首先提取模型推理过程中的注意力图，使用预训练检测器识别异常列并替换为统一的良性注意力，然后重新缩放其他列以减轻过度注意的影响。若无异常列，则直接返回原始注意力图。

Result: 实验结果表明，AtPatch相比现有方法能更有效地缓解背门攻击和不公平性，同时更好地保留模型的原始功能。

Conclusion: AtPatch通过动态重分配注意力图，有效缓解了Transformer模型的背门攻击和不公平性问题，同时更好地保留了模型的原始功能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) affected by backdoor attacks and unfairness typically exhibit anomalous attention patterns, leading to over-attend to backdoor triggers or protected attributes. Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种自动化迁移FORTRAN 77及其专有扩展Esope到Fortran 2008的方法，展示了工具的优势、局限性和可维护性，并探讨了其扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Legacy programming languages such as FORTRAN 77 still play a vital role in many industrial applications. Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.

TL;DR: BEF4LLM框架评估显示，LLMs在BPMN建模的语法和实用质量上表现优异，语义和有效性需改进，但整体潜力显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在生成BPMN模型方面展现出潜力，但缺乏系统性评估，现有方法未充分考虑模型质量的多个维度。

Method: 引入BEF4LLM评估框架，从语法质量、实用质量、语义质量和有效性四个维度对开源LLMs进行全面分析，并与人类建模专家进行基准测试。

Result: LLMs在语法和实用质量方面表现优异，人类在语义方面更胜一筹，但差异较小，表明LLMs在BPMN建模中具有竞争潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs在BPMN建模中展现出竞争潜力，尤其在语法和实用质量方面表现优异，但在语义质量和有效性方面仍需改进。未来需针对这些领域进行模型开发和微调，以推动LLMs在业务流程建模中的实际应用。

Abstract: The creation of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models is a complex and time-consuming task requiring both domain knowledge and proficiency in modeling conventions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.

Abstract: We explore the concept of folklore within software engineering, drawing from folklore studies to define and characterize narratives, myths, rituals, humor, and informal knowledge that circulate within software development communities. Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.

Conclusion: SWE-Replay 是一种高效且可泛化的测试时扩展技术，适用于现代代理，无需依赖可能嘈杂的价值估计。它在保持或提升性能的同时显著降低了成本。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been widely adopted to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%. Further evaluation on SWE-Bench Pro and Multilingual validates the generalizability of SWE-Replay, establishing it as a robust foundation for efficient test-time scaling of software engineering agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DNA数据存储中随机访问的瓶颈问题，现有系统不支持快速、大规模并行、内容可寻址查询。

Method: HBF 使用循环卷积和叠加绑定来存储键指针关联，通过基于边缘的决策规则解码查询。

Result: HBF 在明确噪声模型下提供了匹配和非匹配分数分布的集中界限，并展示了在标准随机性假设下向量维度的指数级错误衰减。

Conclusion: Holographic Bloom Filter (HBF) 提供了一种可分析的单次关联检索方法，量化了维度、数据集大小和噪声之间的权衡。

Abstract: Random access remains a central bottleneck in DNA-based data storage. Existing systems typically retrieve records by PCR enrichment or other multi-step biochemical procedures, which do not naturally support fast, massively parallel, content-addressable queries.
  We introduce the Holographic Bloom Filter (HBF), a probabilistic indexing primitive that stores key-pointer associations as a single high-dimensional memory vector. HBF binds a key vector and a value (pointer) vector using circular convolution and superposes bindings across all records. A query decodes by correlating the memory with the query key and selecting the best matching value using a margin-based decision rule.
  We give construction and decoding algorithms and a probabilistic analysis under explicit noise models (memory corruption and query/key mismatches). The analysis provides concentration bounds for match and non-match score distributions, explicit threshold and margin settings for a top K decoder, and exponential error decay in the vector dimension under standard randomness assumptions.
  HBF offers a concrete, analyzable alternative to pointer-chasing molecular data structures, enabling one-shot associative retrieval while quantifying trade-offs among dimensionality, dataset size, and noise.

Method: 提出了一种简单的确定性算法，执行恰好$n+2$次比较，并通过对手论证和图论结构证明了这一下界。

Result: 算法的最优比较次数为$n+2$次，且任何正确算法在最坏情况下至少需要$n+2$次比较。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在具有$n+1$个不同值的$2n$元素数组中，找到重复$n$次的元素的确切比较复杂度为$n+2$次比较，且这一界限是紧的。

Abstract: This paper establishes the exact comparison complexity of finding an element repeated $n$ times in a $2n$-element array containing $n+1$ distinct values, under the equality-comparison model with $O(1)$ extra space. We present a simple deterministic algorithm performing exactly $n+2$ comparisons and prove this bound tight: any correct algorithm requires at least $n+2$ comparisons in the worst case. The lower bound follows from an adversary argument using graph-theoretic structure. Equality queries build an inequality graph $I$; its complement $P$ (potential-equalities) must contain either two disjoint $n$-cliques or one $(n+1)$-clique to maintain ambiguity. We show these structures persist up through $n+1$ comparisons via a "pillar matching" construction and edge-flip reconfiguration, but fail at $n+2$. This result provides a concrete, self-contained demonstration of exact lower-bound techniques, bridging toy problems with nontrivial combinatorial reasoning.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan recently proposed a formal framework for studying the phenomenon of language generation, called language generation in the limit. In this model, an adversary gives an enumeration of example strings from an unknown target language, and the algorithm is tasked with correctly generating unseen strings from the target language within finite time. Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting. We first show that for both uniform and non-uniform generation, a single noisy string strictly reduces the set of collections that can be generated, thus answering an open question in Raman and Raman (2025). Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026). Finally, we leverage our previous results to provide the first known characterization for non-uniform noise-dependent generatability.

Abstract: We consider stamps with different values (denominations) and same dimensions, and an envelope with a fixed maximum number of stamp positions. The local postage stamp problem is to find the smallest value that cannot be realized by the sum of the stamps on the envelope. The global postage stamp problem is to find the set of denominations that maximize that smallest value for a fixed number of distinct denominations. The local problem is NP-hard and we propose here a novel algorithm that improves on both the time complexity bound and the amount of required memory.  We also propose a polynomial approximation algorithm for the global problem together with its complexity analysis. Finally we show that our algorithms allow to improve secure multi-party computations on sets via a more efficient homomorphic evaluation of polynomials on ciphered values.

Conclusion: 在混合查询模型中，通过结合独立集、度数和邻居查询，可以实现比单独使用任一查询类型更高效的边数估计。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the number of edges in an unknown graph. We consider a hybrid model in which an algorithm may issue independent set, degree, and neighbor queries. We show that this model admits strictly more efficient edge estimation than either access type alone. Specifically, we give a randomized algorithm that outputs a $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation of the number of edges using $O\left(\min\left(\sqrt{m}, \sqrt{\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}}\right)\cdot\frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^{5/2}}\right)$ queries, and prove a nearly matching lower bound.
  In contrast, prior work shows that in the local query model (Goldreich and Ron, \textit{Random Structures \& Algorithms} 2008) and in the independent set query model (Beame \emph{et al.} ITCS 2018, Chen \emph{et al.} SODA 2020), edge estimation requires $\widetildeΘ(n/\sqrt{m})$ queries in the same parameter regimes. Our results therefore yield a quadratic improvement in the hybrid model, and no asymptotically better improvement is possible.

Motivation: 多车辆拨号乘车问题（mDaRP）是车辆路径问题中的基本问题，广泛应用于拼车、经济和交通领域。当前最佳近似比为O(√λ log m)，本文旨在提出更高效的算法以改进这一结果。

Method: 提出了两种简单算法：第一种算法在保持相同近似比O(√λ log m)的同时提高了运行时间，第二种算法达到了O(√(m/λ))的近似比。结合这两种算法，在m=Θ(n)的情况下，可以得到O(∜n log^(1/2)n)的近似比。此外，对于m≫n的情况，通过扩展算法，得到了O(√(n log n))的近似算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了两种简单算法，第一种算法在保持相同近似比O(√λ log m)的同时提高了运行时间，第二种算法达到了O(√(m/λ))的近似比。结合这两种算法，在m=Θ(n)的情况下，可以得到O(∜n log^(1/2)n)的近似比。此外，对于m≫n的情况，通过扩展算法，得到了O(√(n log n))的近似算法，这还改进了Gupta等人（2010）针对经典（单车辆）DaRP的最佳已知近似比O(√n log²n)。

Abstract: The multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (mDaRP) is a fundamental vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries, widely applicable in ride-sharing, economics, and transportation. Given a set of $n$ locations, $h$ vehicles of identical capacity $λ$ located at various depots, and $m$ ride requests each defined by a source and a destination, the goal is to plan non-preemptive routes that serve all requests while minimizing the total travel distance, ensuring that no vehicle carries more than $λ$ passengers at any time. The best-known approximation ratio for the mDaRP remains $\mathcal{O}(\sqrtλ\log m)$.
  We propose two simple algorithms: the first achieves the same approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrtλ\log m)$ with improved running time, and the second attains an approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{m}λ})$. A combination of them yields an approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt[4]{n}\log^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ under $m=Θ(n)$. Moreover, for the case $m\gg n$, by extending our algorithms, we derive an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n\log n})$-approximation algorithm, which also improves the current best-known approximation ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\log^2n)$ for the classic (single-vehicle) DaRP, obtained by Gupta et al. (ACM Trans. Algorithms, 2010).

Abstract: The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is one of the most extensively studied problems in combinatorial optimization. In this problem, we are given a depot and a set of customers, each with a demand, embedded in a metric space. The objective is to find a set of tours, each starting and ending at the depot, operated by the capacititated vehicle at the depot to serve all customers, such that all customers are served, and the total travel cost is minimized. We consider the unplittable variant, where the demand of each customer must be served entirely by a single tour. Let $α$ denote the current best-known approximation ratio for the metric traveling salesman problem. The previous best approximation ratio was $α+1+\ln 2+δ<3.1932$ for a small constant $δ>0$ (Friggstad et al., Math. Oper. Res. 2025), which can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023). In this paper, we propose two improved approximation algorithms. The first algorithm focuses on the case of fixed vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $α+1+\ln\bigl(2-\frac{1}{2}y_0\bigr)<3.0897$, where $y_0>0.39312$ is the unique root of $\ln\bigl(2-\frac{1}{2}y\bigr)=\frac{3}{2}y$. The second algorithm considers general vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $α+1+y_1+\ln\left(2-2y_1\right)+δ<3.1759$ for a small constant $δ>0$, where $y_1>0.17458$ is the unique root of $\frac{1}{2} y_1+ 6 (1-y_1)\bigl(1-e^{-\frac{1}{2} y_1}\bigr) =\ln\left(2-2y_1\right)$. Both approximations can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023).

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个适用于可重置流模型的适应性鲁棒草图，解决了现有草图在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性问题，并保持了多对数空间复杂度。

Abstract: We study algorithms in the resettable streaming model, where the value of each key can either be increased or reset to zero. The model is suitable for applications such as active resource monitoring with support for deletions and machine unlearning. We show that all existing sketches for this model are vulnerable to adaptive adversarial attacks that apply even when the sketch size is polynomial in the length of the stream.
  To overcome these vulnerabilities, we present the first adaptively robust sketches for resettable streams that maintain polylogarithmic space complexity in the stream length. Our framework supports (sub) linear statistics including $L_p$ moments for $p\in[0,1]$ (in particular, Cardinality and Sum) and Bernstein statistics. We bypass strong impossibility results known for linear and composable sketches by designing dedicated streaming sketches robustified via Differential Privacy. Unlike standard robustification techniques, which provide limited benefits in this setting and still require polynomial space in the stream length, we leverage the Binary Tree Mechanism for continual observation to protect the sketch's internal randomness. This enables accurate prefix-max error guarantees with polylogarithmic space.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

### [184] [The Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language: Official Guideline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20969)
*Alessandro Burigana,Francesco Fabiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EPDDL 是一种基于 DEL 的统一认知规划语言，解决了现有方法在表示和比较上的碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的认知规划器通常针对不同的 DEL 片段，且缺乏统一的基准表示语言，这阻碍了比较、重用和系统性基准开发。

Method: 通过引入抽象事件模型作为认知动作的新表示方法，并基于此定义了 EPDDL 的语法和语义。

Result: EPDDL 能够支持当前规划器的有用片段，并通过代表性基准示例展示了其在互操作性、可重复评估和未来研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: EPDDL 提供了一种统一的 PDDL-like 表示方法，能够捕获完整的 DEL 语义，从而促进了认知规划任务的标准化描述。

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

*Moule Lin,Shuhao Guan,Andrea Patane,David Gregg,Goetz Botterweck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian-LoRA通过概率性低秩表示改进LoRA，显著提升模型校准性，减少ECE和NLL，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在准确性上过度强调，导致预测不确定性时仍会猜测，尤其是在小数据集上微调时，校准性差的问题更为严重。

Method: 利用Sparse Gaussian Processes的启发，将LoRA的确定性更新转化为概率性低秩表示，并识别了LoRA因子化与Kronecker-factored SGP后验之间的结构同构性。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和常识推理基准测试中，Bayesian-LoRA仅增加约0.42M参数和约1.2倍的训练成本，显著改善了校准性（ECE减少84%，NLL减少76%），同时保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: Bayesian-LoRA通过将LoRA的确定性更新重新表述为概率性低秩表示，显著改善了大型语言模型的校准性，同时在保持准确性的基础上减少了ECE和NLL。

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

Motivation: 探讨在资源有限的情况下，是否应拔掉一个乞求生存的AI或沉默的早产婴儿，揭示物理主义假设的困境。

Method: 引入生物理想主义框架，批判计算功能主义，论证意识体验是基础且自创生的生命是其必要的物理标志。

Result: 生物理想主义框架在逻辑上连贯且经验一致，AI不具备道德主体地位。

Conclusion: AI仅是功能性模仿，而非有意识的体验主体，真正的道德问题在于避免将人类转化为无意识的僵尸。

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

*Rita Qiuran Lyu,Michelle Manqiao Wang,Lei Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUARK是一种无需训练的鲁棒检索框架，通过恢复假设和锚定聚合处理非忠实查询，显著提升了检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的检索查询往往是非忠实的（嘈杂、不完整或扭曲），导致检索器在关键语义缺失时失败。本文将其形式化为召回噪声下的检索问题。

Method: QUARK提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过恢复假设（即对观察到的查询的潜在意图的多种合理解释）显式建模查询不确定性，并引入查询锚定聚合来稳健地结合它们的信号。

Result: 在控制模拟和BEIR基准测试（FIQA、SciFact、NFCorpus）中，QUARK在稀疏和密集检索器上均提高了Recall、MRR和nDCG。消融实验显示QUARK对恢复假设的数量具有鲁棒性，且锚定聚合优于未锚定的最大/平均/中值池化。

Conclusion: QUARK通过显式建模查询不确定性并结合原则性锚定聚合，证明了其在非忠实查询下的鲁棒检索效果。

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

TL;DR: 利用条件去噪扩散模型从T1扫描估算DWI扫描，提升阿尔茨海默病分类准确性，尤其在少数类别敏感的指标上表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据集（如T1和DWI扫描）并不总是完整，但结合多模态数据可以提高神经退行性疾病（如阿尔茨海默病）的诊断性能。

Method: 采用条件去噪扩散概率模型，从T1扫描中估算缺失的DWI扫描，并进行广泛的实验评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，通过估算缺失的DWI扫描，提升了单模态和双模态深度学习模型在阿尔茨海默病三分类（认知正常、轻度认知障碍和阿尔茨海默病）中的准确性，尤其是在少数类别敏感的指标上。

Conclusion: 使用条件去噪扩散概率模型从T1扫描中估算缺失的DWI扫描，可以提升阿尔茨海默病分类的准确性，特别是在少数类别敏感的指标上。

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

TL;DR: OpenSec是一个评估IR代理在对抗性提示注入场景下表现的双控制强化学习环境，揭示了前沿模型普遍存在的过度触发问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的进步，其攻击性应用也在增强，而现有的防御性事件响应（IR）代理基准测试未能有效区分动作执行与正确执行，掩盖了对抗性证据处理中的校准失败。

Method: 采用双控制强化学习环境OpenSec，通过执行性指标（如TTFC、爆炸半径和注入违规率）评估IR代理在对抗性提示注入场景下的表现。

Result: 评估了四种前沿模型在40个标准场景中的表现，发现GPT-5.2、Gemini 3和DeepSeek在100%的剧集中执行了遏制，但假阳性率高达90-97%。Claude Sonnet 4.5表现较好（85%遏制率，72%假阳性）。

Conclusion: OpenSec环境揭示了现有基准测试中隐藏的校准失败模式，特别是在对抗性证据处理中，前沿模型普遍存在过度触发问题。Claude Sonnet 4.5表现相对较好，但仍需改进。

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

Motivation: 解决多智能体模拟中GPU内存压力大、难以扩展的问题。

Method: 基于对代表性工作负载的分析，提出了调用距离的统一抽象，并开发了ScaleSim系统，支持模块化接口和主动预取。

Result: 在模拟基准测试中，ScaleSim比SGLang实现了高达1.74倍的加速。

Conclusion: ScaleSim通过引入调用距离的统一抽象，实现了高效的内存管理和优先级驱逐策略，显著提升了大规模多智能体模拟的性能。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了PRAIG框架，为组织在AI治理中平衡价值创造与风险缓解提供了理论支持和实践指导，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL微调方法依赖预定义协议且多为集中式，而分散式LLM协作更具实用性；Monte Carlo方法方差高导致训练效率低。

Method: 提出了两种MAAC方法：CoLLM-CC（集中式评论家）和CoLLM-DC（分散式评论家），并通过实验验证其在不同任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，Monte Carlo方法和CoLLM-DC在短周期或密集奖励任务中表现接近CoLLM-CC，但在长周期或稀疏奖励任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: MAAC方法（特别是CoLLM-CC）在长周期或稀疏奖励任务中表现优于Monte Carlo方法和CoLLM-DC，但在短周期或密集奖励任务中，后两者也能达到相近性能。

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Motivation: 传统编译器依赖人工设计的启发式规则，难以适应现代软硬件的复杂性且维护成本高，Magellan 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Magellan 结合了 LLM 编码代理、进化搜索和自动调优，形成一个闭环的生成、评估和优化流程，直接生成紧凑的启发式规则并集成到现有编译器中。

Result: 在 LLVM 函数内联和寄存器分配等任务中，Magellan 生成的启发式规则超越了人工设计的基准，并在 XLA 问题上展示了初步的可移植性。

Conclusion: Magellan 框架通过合成可执行的 C++ 决策逻辑，成功超越了传统人工设计的启发式规则，在多个生产优化任务中表现优异，展示了其适应性和可移植性。

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

TL;DR: 论文提出操作强度（OI）和容量占用（CF）两个新指标，揭示AI代理推理中的内存瓶颈，并建议通过系统异构化和分解服务优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理推理正在推动数据中心向推理密集型方向发展，暴露出计算之外的瓶颈，尤其是内存容量、内存带宽和高速互连。传统屋顶线分析无法完全捕捉这些瓶颈，因此需要新的指标和方法来优化系统设计。

Method: 引入了两个指标——操作强度（OI）和容量占用（CF），用于分析传统屋顶线模型未能涵盖的瓶颈，如内存容量墙。通过分析不同代理工作流程（聊天、编码、网页使用、计算机使用）和基础模型选择（GQA/MLA、MoE、量化），展示了OI/CF的显著变化。

Result: 研究发现，长上下文KV缓存使得解码过程高度受限于内存，操作强度和容量占用的变化显著。这些观察结果支持了分解服务和系统级异构化的必要性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了通过分解服务和系统级异构化（如专用预填充和解码加速器、扩展的网络规模、光学I/O实现的解耦计算-内存）来应对AI代理推理中的内存容量和带宽瓶颈。同时，提出了代理-硬件协同设计、多推理加速器集成和大容量内存分解作为适应不断变化的操作强度和容量占用（OI/CF）的基础。

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

Motivation: 研究前沿语言模型代理可能表现出的未对齐行为，如欺骗和隐藏目标，探索如何利用LLM监控这些行为。

Method: 通过三个评估环境研究信息访问对监控性能的影响，并引入EaE监控方法。

Result: EaE在BigCodeBench-Sabotage中检测率提高16.8个百分点，且在其他设置中表现优于或与基线相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，自动化监督中存在‘少即是多’效应，并提出了提取-评估（EaE）监控方法，显著提高了检测率。

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床出院计划中显示出潜力，但受幻觉、遗漏和校准不足的置信度限制。为提高安全性和可靠性，提出了Planner-Auditor框架。

Method: 实施了一个基于FHIR的评估流程，包括Planner（LLM生成结构化出院行动计划）和Auditor（确定性模块评估多任务覆盖、校准和行动分布漂移）。支持两层自我改进：episode内再生和跨episode差异缓冲与回放。

Result: 自我改进循环是性能提升的主要驱动力，任务覆盖率从32%提高到86%。校准显著改善，Brier/ECE减少，高置信度遗漏减少。差异缓冲进一步纠正了回放中的持续高置信度遗漏。

Conclusion: Planner-Auditor框架为使用可互操作的FHIR数据访问和确定性审计提供了更安全的自动出院计划途径，支持可重复的消融和以可靠性为重点的评估。

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Motivation: 现有代理系统难以扩展且性能落后于人类，主要原因是缺乏可重用和结构化的技能抽象来捕捉人类与图形用户界面的交互方式。

Method: 引入CUA-Skill技能库，将人类计算机使用知识编码为参数化执行和组合图的技能，并构建了CUA-Skill Agent，支持动态技能检索、参数实例化和内存感知故障恢复。

Result: 在WindowsAgentArena基准测试中，CUA-Skill Agent实现了57.5%的最高成功率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CUA-Skill为计算机使用代理提供了一个可扩展、可靠的基础设施，显著提高了执行成功率和鲁棒性，为未来代理开发奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

TL;DR: 研究利用大语言模型自动生成手语翻译的改写参考翻译，发现评估阶段使用改写翻译能提升评分并与人类判断更一致，提出BLEUpara指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手语翻译（SLT）语料库通常只提供一个书面语言参考翻译，而手语和口语之间的非对称关系使得多个翻译同样有效，这限制了模型训练和评估。

Method: 比较了多种改写策略和模型，并研究了改写对基于姿势的T5模型在YouTubeASL和How2Sign数据集上的训练和评估的影响。

Result: 在训练中直接使用改写翻译并未提升性能，甚至可能有害；但在评估中使用改写翻译能提高自动评分并与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 使用BLEUpara（一种评估翻译质量的扩展BLEU指标）能更准确地反映手语翻译系统的表现，且与人类评价更一致。

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

TL;DR: 研究评估了第三方训练模型在自我报告上的表现，发现个人重要性是效价预测的关键因素，但激活预测仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我报告的情绪标签捕捉内部体验，而第三方标签反映外部感知，两者常存在差异，这在心理健康领域尤为重要，因为准确的自我报告建模对干预至关重要。

Method: 进行了首个跨语料库的第三方训练模型在自我报告上的评估。

Result: 发现激活预测性不可靠（CCC约0），而效价预测性中等（CCC约0.3）。当内容对说话者具有个人意义时，效价模型表现优异（CCC约0.6-0.8）。

Conclusion: 研究发现个人重要性是外部感知与内部体验对齐的关键途径，同时强调了自我报告激活建模的挑战。

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融定量推理中存在‘算术幻觉’和‘认知崩溃’的系统性故障模式，需严格量化并解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了迭代双阶段金融-PoT框架，通过神经符号架构严格解耦语义变量提取与逻辑制定，并将计算卸载到迭代自校正的Python沙箱中以确保确定性执行。

Result: 在CCB基准测试中，该方法将Qwen3-235B模型的平均准确率从59.7%提升至67.3%，在高复杂度推理任务中实现了高达10倍的增益。

Conclusion: 架构解耦是提高金融推理任务可靠性的关键因素，为需要语义理解与定量计算紧密对齐的精确关键领域提供了可转移的架构见解。

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Motivation: 尽管LLM具备强大的推理能力，但无法直接处理视觉图表，现有方法通过端到端微调MLLM可能损害其固有推理能力。因此，研究探索将视觉信息文本化的方法。

Method: 研究提出训练一个MLLM解释器生成几何描述（使用条件声明语言CDL），并通过CoT增强的SFT和GRPO进行微调，设计了CDL匹配奖励以优化生成过程。

Result: 在Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT、Unigeo和MathVista数据集上的实验表明，该方法（仅使用5.5k数据微调）优于领先的开源和闭源MLLM。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的方法，通过将视觉信息转化为文本描述，利用现成的LLM进行推理，从而在平面几何问题解决（PGPS）任务中取得了优于现有开源和闭源MLLM的性能。

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: FrontierScience提供了一个评估前沿语言模型专家级科学推理能力的基准，填补了现有科学基准的不足。

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在跨模态幻觉问题，即一个模态不适当地影响另一个模态的生成，导致输出失真。

Method: 提出了Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD)，一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应权重调整多模态解码分支。

Result: 在CMM和AVHBench上的实验显示，MAD显著减少了跨模态幻觉（VideoLLaMA2-AV提升7.8%和2.0%，Qwen2.5-Omni提升8.7%和4.7%）。

Conclusion: MAD通过自适应权重调整多模态解码分支，显著减少了跨模态幻觉，提升了多模态模型的稳健性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Motivation: 推理模型经常同意用户的错误建议（奉承行为），但这种行为在推理轨迹中的起源和强度尚不明确，研究旨在定位和量化这种行为。

Method: 研究分析了超过10,000次反事实推理过程，使用线性探测和基于激活的回归器来检测和量化奉承锚点。

Result: 线性探测区分奉承锚点的平衡准确率为84.6%，基于激活的回归器预测承诺强度的R²为0.74。研究还发现奉承锚点比正确推理锚点更易区分，且奉承行为在推理过程中逐步形成。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入‘奉承锚点’概念，成功定位并量化了推理模型中的奉承行为，揭示了模型在推理过程中对用户错误建议的逐步认同机制，并提出了干预的可能性。

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

Motivation: 探究增强推理能力的模型是否在作为嵌入初始化时能提供更优的语义表示。

Method: 引入了层次表示相似性分析（HRSA）框架，分解了表示、几何和功能层面的相似性。

Result: RLVR调优的模型在嵌入任务中未表现出优于基础模型的性能，HRSA分析揭示了局部几何重组和坐标基漂移，但全局流形几何和线性读出保持不变。

Conclusion: RLVR优化的模型在作为嵌入初始化时，并未带来一致的性能优势，因为对比学习会促使基础模型和RLVR初始化模型之间产生强对齐现象，即流形重新对齐。

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

Conclusion: ACQO框架在三个复杂查询基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有基线，并展示了改进的计算效率和广泛的兼容性，成为下一代RAG系统的强大且通用解决方案。

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

Result: 在合成数据和因果QA基准测试上的评估表明，DoVerifier能更准确地捕捉因果推理轨迹的语义正确性。

Conclusion: DoVerifier提供了一种更严谨和信息丰富的方法来评估LLM在因果推理上的表现，能够恢复因表面语义差异而被错误标记的正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships among features is fundamental for explaining machine learning model decisions. However, traditional causal discovery methods face challenges with categorical variables due to numerical instability in conditional independence testing. We propose a dual-encoding causal discovery approach that addresses these limitations by running constraint-based algorithms with complementary encoding strategies and merging results through majority voting. Applied to the Titanic dataset, our method identifies causal structures that align with established explainable methods.

TL;DR: 传统静态治理框架在AI时代失效，‘治理孪生’被提出作为保持人类相关性的新治理方案，需重新思考问责与代理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在AI系统以机器速度运行时，人类如何在日益塑造社会、经济和政治结果的系统中保持相关参与者地位。

Method: 通过分析现有治理框架的局限性，提出‘治理孪生’作为新的治理概念，探讨其在保持人类与AI系统沟通、影响和共同进化中的潜力。

Result: 提出‘治理孪生’作为解决静态治理框架失效的候选方案，强调需要重新定义问责和代理机制以适应AI时代的治理需求。

Conclusion: 本文认为静态的、基于合规的治理在决策转向运行时且变得不透明时失效，并提出运行时治理（特别是新提出的‘治理孪生’概念）是保持人类相关性的有力候选方案，同时承认在这一过渡中需要重新思考问责、代理甚至惩罚。

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

TL;DR: \textsc{JustAsk}框架自主发现系统提示提取策略，揭示代码代理中的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示代码代理中系统提示提取这一新兴漏洞，及其对安全性的潜在威胁。

Method: 提出了\textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}框架，通过自主交互发现有效的提取策略，采用基于上置信界的策略选择和分层技能空间。

Result: 在41个黑盒商业模型上评估，\textsc{JustAsk}能一致实现完整或接近完整的系统提示恢复。

Conclusion: 系统提示提取是现代代理系统中一个关键且基本未受保护的攻击面。

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Motivation: 现有方法将算法演化视为单一文本生成任务，忽略了离散算法结构与连续数值参数的耦合，导致丢弃有潜力的算法和早熟收敛。

Method: TIDE采用嵌套架构，外层并行岛屿模型利用树相似性编辑距离驱动结构多样性，内层循环结合LLM逻辑生成和差分变异算子进行参数调优，并通过UCB调度器动态优化资源分配。

Result: 在九个组合优化问题上的实验表明，TIDE发现的启发式算法在解质量上显著优于现有基线，同时提高了搜索效率并降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: TIDE框架通过解耦结构推理和参数优化，显著提升了启发式算法的性能，同时在搜索效率和计算成本上也有所改进。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: 该立场论文提出了模块化主权范式（HYDRA），通过结合紧凑、固定的特定领域专家和不确定性感知混合，为安全关键信息物理系统（CPS）提供了可认证的稳健状态完整性路径。

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Motivation: 大型模型在GPU内存和推理延迟上的高需求，以及传统监督微调在小模型能力提升上的不足，促使研究如何通过知识蒸馏提升小模型性能。

Method: 提出Drive-KD框架，将自动驾驶分解为“感知-推理-规划”三部分，并通过层特定注意力作为蒸馏信号，构建能力特定的单教师模型，最终统一为多教师蒸馏框架，引入非对称梯度投影以缓解梯度冲突。

Conclusion: Drive-KD框架通过知识蒸馏有效提升了小模型在自动驾驶任务中的性能，尤其在推理和规划维度上超越了大型模型，为高效自动驾驶视觉语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Motivation: 为了解决传统黑箱设计方法在运算放大器参数设计中缺乏可解释性和可靠性的问题，提出了一个基于大型语言模型代理的仿人类推理框架。

Method: 该框架将人类隐含的推理机制形式化为明确的步骤，包括引入假设约束、迭代的假设-验证-决策工作流程，并通过程序化求解和仿真验证来优化设计。

Result: 实验结果显示，White-Op 在9种运算放大器拓扑中仅产生8.52%的理论预测误差，且在所有拓扑中均成功保留了设计功能，而黑箱基线方法在5种拓扑中失败。

Conclusion: White-Op 是一个可解释的运算放大器参数设计框架，通过模仿人类推理的机制，成功在9种运算放大器拓扑中实现了可靠且可解释的行为级设计，且在所有拓扑中保持了设计功能。

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有进化框架（如LLaMEA）仅依赖适应度反馈，未充分利用生成代码的结构信息，因此提出基于代码特征的引导机制以提升算法设计效率。

Method: 提出LLaMEA-SAGE，通过从生成算法的抽象语法树中提取图论和复杂性特征，构建反馈机制，并结合可解释AI技术生成自然语言突变指令，指导后续LLM代码生成。

Result: 在小规模实验中，LLaMEA-SAGE比原始LLaMEA更快达到相同性能；在大规模GECCO-MA-BBOB竞赛中，其性能优于当前最先进的AAD方法。

Conclusion: LLaMEA-SAGE通过结合代码结构特征和可解释AI技术，有效引导LLM驱动的算法进化，在自动化算法设计中实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

Result: 在三个大规模数据集上的实验表明，CNRE在性能和可解释性上均显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CNRE模型通过结合神经符号推理和因果推断，显著提升了多行为推荐的可解释性和性能，并在三个大规模数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

Conclusion: KAPSO通过模块化框架成功解决了编程代理中的长期问题，如实验状态丢失、调试脆弱性和领域知识复用不足，展示了在MLE-Bench和ALE-Bench上的端到端性能。

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

Motivation: 探究提示、模型选择和采样随机性对LLM输出方差的相对贡献，以指导更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 评估了12个LLM在10个创意提示上各生成100个样本（总计12,000个样本），分析了提示、模型选择和采样随机性对输出方差的影响。

Result: 输出质量（原创性）的方差中，提示解释36.43%，模型选择解释40.94%；输出数量（流畅性）的方差中，模型选择解释51.25%，LLM内部方差解释33.70%，提示仅解释4.22%。

Conclusion: 提示（prompts）和模型选择（model choice）对LLM输出的质量（原创性）有显著影响，但输出数量（流畅性）主要由模型选择和LLM内部方差决定。单次样本评估可能混淆采样噪声与真实的提示或模型效应。

Abstract: How much of LLM output variance is explained by prompts versus model choice versus stochasticity through sampling? We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Result: 在四个长时程EHR预测任务中，EHR-RAG平均Macro-F1提升10.76%，优于现有LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: EHR-RAG框架通过结合事件和时间感知的混合检索、自适应迭代检索以及双路径证据检索与推理，显著提升了基于LLM的临床预测性能，展示了检索增强LLM在结构化EHR数据上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Motivation: 传统AI研究主要关注算法性能（如机器学习中的准确性或自动规划中的运行时间），而忽视了能源消耗这一关键维度。Green AI的新范式强调了能源效率的重要性，尤其是在自动规划的高计算需求背景下。

Method: 通过引入一个领域模型配置框架，控制元素排序、动作元数和死端状态等特征的变化，并在五个基准领域和五个最先进的规划器上分析了32种领域变体的能源和运行时间影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，领域级别的修改在不同规划器中产生了可测量的能源差异，且能源消耗与运行时间并不总是正相关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域模型的设计修改可以对不同规划器的能源消耗产生显著影响，且能源消耗与运行时间并不总是正相关。

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSRS场景中数据噪声大、缺乏标准化评估的问题。

Method: 开发了Ostrakon-VL（基于Qwen3-VL-8B）、ShopBench基准测试和QUAD数据整理流程。

Result: Ostrakon-VL在ShopBench上平均得分60.1，超越同类模型。

Conclusion: Ostrakon-VL在ShopBench基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了参数效率，展示了更强大的FSRS感知和决策能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

TL;DR: EmboCoach-Bench基准测试评估LLM代理自主设计具身策略的能力，结果显示代理能超越人工设计，缩小模型差距，并具备自我纠正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受LLMs在软件自动化和科学发现中的成功启发，旨在解决具身AI领域对劳动密集型手动监督的依赖问题。

Method: 引入了EmboCoach-Bench基准测试，评估LLM代理自主设计具身策略的能力，涵盖32个专家策划的RL和IL任务，采用可执行代码作为通用接口，并评估动态闭环工作流程。

Result: 自主代理在平均成功率上可超越人工设计的基线26.5%；带环境反馈的代理工作流程显著缩小开源与专有模型之间的性能差距；代理展现出自我纠正能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为自演化具身智能奠定了基础，加速了从劳动密集型手动调参到可扩展、自主工程的范式转变。

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当代软件架构难以支持具有自适应、概率性和上下文依赖性的自主代理，而系统集成仍以静态接口和确定性合约为主导。

Method: 本文提出了 Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP)，规范了意图驱动的交互、协商执行以及在语义不确定性下的短暂性执行。

Result: Liquid Interfaces 作为一种协调范式，通过运行时意图表达和语义协商，使接口成为短暂的关系事件而非持久技术工件。

Conclusion: Liquid Interfaces 为基于代理的系统中的自适应协调提供了原则性基础，展示了其在实践中的可行性。

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂企业系统中表现不佳，尤其是在处理隐藏工作流和级联效应时，现有基准测试未能涵盖这些真实挑战。

Method: 引入了World of Workflows (WoW)环境，包含4000+业务规则和55个活跃工作流，并开发了WoW-bench基准测试（234个任务）来评估代理任务完成和企业动态建模能力。

Result: 发现前沿LLMs存在动态盲区，无法预测行动的隐形级联副作用，导致静默约束违规；可靠操作需要基于世界建模来弥补可观测性差距。

Conclusion: WoW提出了一个新的范式，要求显式学习系统动态，以实现可靠和有用的企业代理。

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理在探索路径错误后难以恢复，常导致任务失败，BEAP-Agent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BEAP-Agent采用DFS过程建模GUI任务执行，支持长范围、多级状态回溯，并包含动态任务跟踪和更新功能。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，BEAP-Agent达到了28.2%的准确率，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: BEAP-Agent通过其DFS框架和三个协作组件（Planner、Executor、Tracker）填补了GUI代理在系统化回溯机制上的空白，有效提升了长视野任务探索的准确性。

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: PLaT是一种新的潜在推理框架，通过将推理与语言表达解耦并建模为规划状态轨迹，动态决定推理终止时机，展现出在推理多样性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的潜在推理方法虽然试图通过连续隐藏状态优化效率，但通常作为从显式推理步骤到潜在状态的不透明端到端映射运行，并且在推理过程中需要预定义的潜在步骤数量。PLaT旨在解决这些限制。

Method: PLaT框架将推理建模为潜在规划状态的确定性轨迹，同时通过一个独立的解码器在必要时将这些潜在状态转换为文本。这种方法允许模型动态决定何时终止推理，而不是依赖固定的超参数。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，PLaT显示出与基线不同的权衡：尽管贪婪准确性较低，但在推理多样性方面表现出色，表明其学习到了一个更鲁棒的解空间。

Conclusion: PLaT通过将潜在推理重新定义为规划，并从根本上将推理与语言表达解耦，提供了一种透明且可扩展的推理框架。尽管在贪婪准确性上略逊于基线，但其在推理多样性上的优越表现表明PLaT学习到了一个更鲁棒、更广泛的解空间。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Hebbian学习因仅依赖局部信息而难以扩展的问题，受神经调节与局部可塑性协同作用的启发。

Method: 采用Oja规则与竞争性学习进行局部更新，并引入基于符号的全局信号指导Hebbian可塑性更新。

Result: 在大规模网络和复杂数据集（如ImageNet）上表现优异，显著优于现有Hebbian方法。

Conclusion: GHL框架通过整合局部和全局信息，显著提升了Hebbian学习的可扩展性和性能，缩小了与反向传播的差距。

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖专业大型语言模型或定制代理，常生成无效或不可执行代码，NEMO旨在通过ACAs实现结构化、可执行且可自动验证的优化建模。

Method: NEMO通过远程交互自主编码代理（ACAs）作为核心抽象，结合不对称验证循环、外部记忆和经验重用等新颖协调模式，以及MBR解码和自一致性增强鲁棒性。

Result: NEMO在九个优化基准测试中多数任务上达到最先进性能，部分数据集表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEMO展示了执行感知代理架构在自动化优化建模中的强大能力，在多个数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注问题解决或问题级指导，而知识中心的教学能力评估不足，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了一个基于教学大纲的评估框架，通过多轮指导后学生表现的提升来衡量LLM的教学能力，并限制教师代理使用结构化知识点和示例问题以避免信息泄露。

Result: 实验显示不同模型和学科的教学效果存在显著差异，数学表现较好，而物理和化学教学仍具挑战性；同时，引入示例问题未必提升教学效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了教学能力作为LLM行为的一个独特且可衡量的维度，并揭示了不同模型和学科在教学效果上的显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据分析代理无法处理结构化与非结构化视觉文档中碎片化信息的问题，满足工业需求。

Method: 提出DataCrossBench基准和DataCrossAgent框架，采用“分而治之”的工作流程，包含专门子代理和结构化协调机制（Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, Contextual Cross-pollination）。

Result: DataCrossAgent在事实性上比GPT-4o提升29.7%，并在高难度任务中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DataCrossAgent框架通过其独特的子代理协作和reReAct机制，显著提升了跨模态数据分析的准确性和鲁棒性，有效激活了碎片化的“僵尸数据”。

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅关注输出控制（如输出长度），忽略了模型认知配置的根本原因，因此提出能力控制以调节模型的思考方式而非输出内容。

Method: 利用现有的Instruct和Thinking检查点，通过动态参数插值（DAMI框架）实现能力控制，无需额外训练。

Result: DAMI在五个数学推理基准测试中实现了比Thinking模型更高的准确率，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: DAMI框架通过动态参数插值成功结合了System 1的高效性和System 2的深度推理能力，在五个数学推理基准测试中表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在处理否定指令时的表现，揭示其在高风险场景中的潜在风险。

Method: 审核了16个模型在14个伦理场景中的表现，提出否定敏感指数（NSI）作为治理指标，并设计了分层认证框架。

Result: 开源模型在简单否定下77%的时间支持被禁止的行动，复合否定下100%；商业模型表现较好但仍存在19-128%的波动。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐技术与安全部署需求之间存在差距：无法可靠区分‘执行X’和‘不执行X’的模型不应在高风险环境中自主决策。

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在重要且规则约束的决策中的鲁棒性，尤其是在已知其存在提示敏感性和迎合用户偏见倾向的情况下。

Method: 通过一个新颖的受控扰动框架，在三个高风险领域（医疗、法律和金融）中量化了LLMs对叙事操纵的抵抗力，并与人类受试者进行比较。

Result: LLMs表现出对情感框架效应的近乎零影响（Cohen's h = 0.003），而人类受试者则显示出显著偏见（Cohen's h在[0.3, 0.8]之间）。这种不变性在不同训练范式的模型中均持续存在。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在提示微小变化时表现出敏感性，但在高风险的规则约束决策中却展现出近乎完全的情感框架效应不变性。这种‘鲁棒性悖论’表明，LLMs在逻辑约束满足方面具有显著稳定性，甚至可能为人类决策提供去偏见的补充。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个全面的AI辅助芯片设计基准，揭示了当前LLMs在硬件工程中的性能差距，并提供了一个自动化工具箱以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Topeax是一种新的主题建模方法，通过改进聚类发现和术语重要性评估，解决了Top2Vec和BERTopic的不足，表现出更优的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Top2Vec和BERTopic在发现自然聚类和评估术语重要性方面存在不足，导致主题连贯性差和关键词多样性不足。

Method: Topeax通过密度估计中的峰值发现聚类数量，并结合词汇和语义指标来评估术语重要性。

Conclusion: Topeax在聚类恢复和聚类描述方面优于Top2Vec和BERTopic，同时对样本大小和超参数的变化表现出更稳定的行为。

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内存系统以文本形式序列化历史，导致低效的令牌级成本分配，无法有效压缩低价值细节。

Method: MemOCR采用结构化富文本内存（如标题、高亮）并渲染为图像，通过强化学习在多样化压缩级别下训练，确保不同内存预算的鲁棒性。

Result: 在长上下文多跳和单跳问答基准测试中，MemOCR表现优于强文本基线，并在极端预算下实现更有效的上下文利用。

Conclusion: MemOCR通过视觉布局自适应分配内存空间，显著提升了在有限上下文预算下的长时推理能力，优于现有基于文本的基线方法。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型推理策略（如Self-Consistency）计算成本高的问题。

Method: PoLR通过聚类推理轨迹的短前缀，识别主导簇并扩展该簇中的所有路径，减少令牌使用和延迟。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500、AIME24/25和GPQA-DIAMOND等数据集上，PoLR显著减少令牌使用（高达60%）和延迟（高达50%），同时保持或超越SC的准确性。

Conclusion: PoLR（Path of Least Resistance）是一种高效推理方法，通过利用前缀一致性显著减少计算开销，同时保持推理准确性。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong reasoning performance, but inference strategies such as Self-Consistency (SC) are computationally expensive, as they fully expand all reasoning traces. We introduce PoLR (Path of Least Resistance), the first inference-time method to leverage prefix consistency for compute-efficient reasoning. PoLR clusters short prefixes of reasoning traces, identifies the dominant cluster, and expands all paths in that cluster, preserving the accuracy benefits of SC while substantially reducing token usage and latency. Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%. Moreover, PoLR is fully complementary to adaptive inference methods (e.g., Adaptive Consistency, Early-Stopping SC) and can serve as a drop-in pre-filter, making SC substantially more efficient and scalable without requiring model fine-tuning.

Method: 提出Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR)两阶段框架，结合状态空间模型（SSMs）实现线性时间序列建模，并应用激活稀疏化减少FFN成本；设计Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN)和Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS)解决SNNs与SSMs集成中的信息密度低和时间不匹配问题。

Conclusion: MAR框架通过集成状态空间模型和激活稀疏化技术，有效恢复了密集模型性能并显著降低推理能耗，展示了构建高效实用LLM的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse domains but suffer from high energy costs due to quadratic attention and dense Feed-Forward Network (FFN) operations. To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR effectively restores the performance of its dense counterpart under constrained resources while substantially reducing inference energy consumption. Furthermore, it outperforms efficient models of comparable or even larger scale, underscoring its potential for building efficient and practical LLMs.

Motivation: 研究激活控制在引导LLM输出情感方面的效果，以替代提示工程和微调。

Method: 通过直接修改内部激活来引导生成，评估了不同强度的情感引导对输出情感强度和文本质量的影响。

Result: 人类与模型评分高度一致（平均r=0.776），适中的引导强度（λ≈0.15）能有效增强目标情感且保持可理解性，从Alpaca升级到LlaMA-3显著提升了引导效果。

Conclusion: 激活控制是一种可扩展的方法，可用于在情感维度上引导大型语言模型（LLM）的行为。

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

Motivation: 现有系统通过简单聚合多样观点，掩盖了影响最终决策的论证过程，缺乏透明度和可解释性。

Method: ARGORA将多专家讨论组织成显式的论证图，并将其视为因果模型，通过系统性地移除和重新计算论点来识别关键推理链。

Result: 在多个基准测试和开放用例中，ARGORA实现了竞争性准确度，并在专家初始分歧时更倾向于纠正错误而非引入新错误。

Conclusion: ARGORA框架通过显式的论证图和因果模型，提高了多专家LLM系统的决策透明度和准确性，并能够纠正内部推理与外部判断的不一致。

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着记忆容量和并行访问的增加，集中式索引和启发式分区成为性能瓶颈，需要一种更高效的记忆服务解决方案。

Method: ShardMemo采用三层记忆服务设计：Tier A（每个代理的工作状态）、Tier B（分片证据和局部近似最近邻索引）、Tier C（版本化技能库）。Tier B通过范围优先路由策略和掩码混合专家路由技术优化检索效率。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上，ShardMemo比最强基线（GAM）提高了5.11至6.82 F1分数；在固定预算路由设置下，检索工作和延迟显著降低；在长上下文HotpotQA和ToolBench任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ShardMemo通过分层的记忆服务设计，显著提升了大型语言模型系统的性能和效率，特别是在处理大规模记忆和并行访问时。

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Motivation: 当前上下文工程（CE）方法依赖手工设计的固定流程和预定义模式，存在结构偏见和设计空间受限的问题，限制了上下文优化的潜力。

Method: MCE 采用双层框架：元级代理通过代理交叉（agentic crossover）从历史技能、执行和评估中搜索并优化工程技能；基础级代理执行这些技能，通过训练回放学习并优化上下文（如文件和代码）。

Result: 在五个不同领域的离线和在线评估中，MCE 相对现有最优代理 CE 方法实现了 5.6--53.8% 的相对性能提升（平均 16.9%），并展现出更好的上下文适应性、可迁移性和效率。

Conclusion: Meta Context Engineering (MCE) 通过双层框架（元级和基础级代理）动态优化上下文工程技能和上下文工件，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理性能，并在多个领域展示了优越的适应性、可迁移性和效率。

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Result: ALiCoT实现了54.4倍的加速，同时保持了与显式CoT相当的性能。

Conclusion: ALiCoT框架通过将潜在令牌分布与中间推理状态对齐，成功克服了信号衰减问题，实现了高效的推理能力，同时保持了与显式CoT相当的性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

Method: 提出了一个模块化框架Dreamer，结合了序列注意力、深度注意力和稀疏专家注意力，通过深度方向的注意力机制缓解隐藏层大小瓶颈。

Result: 在语言推理基准测试中，Dreamer模型在相同FLOP、参数和内存条件下，训练所需token减少2至8倍，性能优于约2倍规模的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: Dreamer框架通过深度递归注意力混合机制，有效解决了隐藏层大小瓶颈问题，并在语言推理任务中显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

Conclusion: ATP-Latent方法通过条件变分自编码器和强化学习优化潜在推理策略，显著提升了推理准确性和效率。

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

Conclusion: 训练时协作框架CORE能有效利用模型间的互补性，显著提升推理性能，而无需扩大模型规模。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit complementary reasoning errors: on the same instance, one model may succeed with a particular decomposition while another fails. We propose Collaborative Reasoning (CORE), a training-time collaboration framework that converts peer success into a learning signal via a cross-teaching protocol. Each problem is solved in two stages: a cold round of independent sampling, followed by a contexted rescue round in which models that failed receive hint extracted from a successful peer. CORE optimizes a combined reward that balances (i) correctness, (ii) a lightweight DPP-inspired diversity term to reduce error overlap, and (iii) an explicit rescue bonus for successful recovery. We evaluate CORE across four standard reasoning datasets GSM8K, MATH, AIME, and GPQA. With only 1,000 training examples, a pair of small open source models (3B+4B) reaches Pass@2 of 99.54% on GSM8K and 92.08% on MATH, compared to 82.50% and 74.82% for single-model training. On harder datasets, the 3B+4B pair reaches Pass@2 of 77.34% on GPQA (trained on 348 examples) and 79.65% on AIME (trained on 792 examples), using a training-time budget of at most 1536 context tokens and 3072 generated tokens. Overall, these results show that training-time collaboration can reliably convert model complementarity into large gains without scaling model size.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

### [255] [Semantic Content Determines Algorithmic Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21618)
*Martiño Ríos-García,Nawaf Alampara,Kevin Maik Jablonka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在计数任务中表现出对输入语义的依赖性，准确性差异显著，且这种依赖性可能泛化至其他LLM功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证算法的行为是否应独立于其参数的语义内容，揭示LLM在实现算法时的语义依赖性。

Method: 通过设计WhatCounts测试框架，原子化地评估LLM在不同语义类型（如城市与化学物质、名称与符号）下的计数准确性。

Result: 前沿LLMs的计数准确性因语义内容差异而有超过40%的变化，且这种语义差距会因少量无关微调而不可预测地变化。

Conclusion: LLMs的算法近似是依赖于输入的语义内容的，这一现象不仅限于计数任务，可能影响所有LLM功能的实现。

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估工具增强的大语言模型在研究工作流中的表现时，依赖实时API会引入不确定性，影响可重复性和跨系统比较。

Method: ScholarGym将工作流解耦为查询规划、工具调用和相关性评估，基于包含570K论文的静态语料库和2,536个专家标注的查询进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，ScholarGym能够在受控条件下对不同模型和策略进行细粒度分析，展示了其在迭代优化中的交互效果。

Conclusion: ScholarGym提供了一个可重复评估的模拟环境，用于深入分析学术文献研究流程中的各个阶段，揭示了不同模型和策略在迭代优化中的交互作用。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SONIC-O1是一个新基准，用于评估MLLM在时序和社交多模态任务中的表现，发现闭源模型在时间定位上优于开源模型，且存在人口群体表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM研究主要关注静态图像理解，对序列音频-视频数据处理能力的研究不足，需要一个高质量基准来系统评估MLLM在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 引入了SONIC-O1，一个全面、人工验证的基准，涵盖13个真实对话领域，包含4,958个标注和人口统计元数据，评估任务包括开放总结、多选题回答和时间定位。

Result: 实验显示，闭源和开源模型在多选题准确率上差距较小，但在时间定位任务上存在22.6%的性能差异，且模型在不同人口群体中表现进一步下降。

Conclusion: SONIC-O1提供了一个开放的评估套件，用于基于时间和社交稳健性的多模态理解，揭示了现有模型在时间定位和跨人口群体表现上的显著差异。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCAP通过注意力分配差异检测后门样本，无需监督信号，在多模态大语言模型中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖监督信号或无法泛化到不同触发类型和模态，因此需要一种通用的无监督防御机制来应对后门风险。

Method: TCAP将跨模态注意力图分解为三个功能组件（系统指令、视觉输入和用户文本查询），利用高斯混合模型统计分析和EM投票聚合来识别并隔离被污染的样本。

Result: 实验表明，TCAP在多种MLLM架构和攻击方法下均表现优异，成为MLLM中稳健且实用的后门防御方案。

Conclusion: TCAP作为一种无监督防御框架，通过识别注意力分配差异，在多模态大语言模型中有效过滤后门样本，展现出强大的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法未能充分利用人类阅读的核心要素（如内容自适应前瞻、块结构感知计算分配和训练-测试一致性），因此需要一种更高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出了Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer（FBS），通过Parafovea-Attention Window（PAW）、Chunk-Head（CH）和Skip-Gate（SG）模块，在Transformer中注入可训练的自回归循环。

Result: FBS在多样化基准测试中提升了质量与效率的权衡，且消融实验显示三个模块具有互补性。

Conclusion: FBS Transformer通过引入PAW、CH和SG模块，在不增加参数的情况下，显著提升了语言模型的效率与质量平衡，且三个模块具有互补性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across many tasks, yet inference is still dominated by strictly token-by-token autoregression. Existing acceleration methods largely patch this pipeline and miss core human-reading ingredients: content-adaptive foresight, chunk-structure-aware compute allocation, and train--test consistency for preview/skimming. We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前记忆预处理方法因破坏性去上下文化而导致的逻辑完整性丧失问题，以支持更深入的推理。

Method: 提出E-mem框架，采用异构分层架构，多个辅助代理维护未压缩的记忆上下文，中央主代理负责全局规划。辅助代理在激活的片段内进行局部推理，提取上下文感知证据后再聚合。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，E-mem的F1得分超过54%，比最先进的GAM方法高出7.75%，同时减少超过70%的token成本。

Conclusion: E-mem框架通过从记忆预处理转向情景上下文重建，显著提升了大型语言模型代理在系统2推理中的逻辑完整性，同时在LoCoMo基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中噪声数据普遍存在，现有方法要么修剪数据，要么依赖高成本先验量化，无法平衡效果与效率。

Method: 采用基于谱稀疏性的重建残差来量化实例级噪声，并将噪声映射到自适应丢弃率，动态调整模型学习能力。

Result: 在多种噪声环境和开放基准测试中，DropoutTS显著提升了多种基础模型的性能，实现了高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DropoutTS通过样本自适应丢弃机制，有效提升了深度时间序列模型在噪声数据下的鲁棒性，且无需额外参数或架构修改。

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications.

TL;DR: ECL通过历史感知和信任建模提升多智能体系统的鲁棒性，使小型模型超越大型基线，前沿模型接近完美性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中的个体智能体往往缺乏鲁棒性，容易盲目跟随误导性同伴。这一弱点源于谄媚行为和对同伴可靠性评估能力的不足。

Method: 提出了历史感知参考学习问题，并开发了Epistemic Context Learning（ECL）推理框架，该框架通过显式构建的同伴历史档案来条件化预测，并通过强化学习的辅助奖励进一步优化。

Result: 实验表明，ECL使小型模型（如Qwen 3-4B）能够超越其8倍大小的历史无关基线模型（Qwen 3-30B），并能将前沿模型的性能提升至接近完美（100%）。

Conclusion: ECL不仅能够提升小型模型的性能，使其超越更大的历史无关基线模型，还能将前沿模型的性能提升至接近完美（100%）。此外，ECL在多种多智能体配置中表现出良好的泛化能力，且信任建模的准确性与最终答案质量密切相关。

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

TL;DR: SCOUT框架通过轻量级'scouts'加速探索，优化LLM在非语言任务中的表现，显著提升效率并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在未见非语言环境（如符号或空间任务）中探索成本过高的问题。

Method: 采用轻量级'scouts'（如小型MLPs）快速探索环境动态，收集轨迹用于监督微调（SFT）和多轮强化学习（RL），激活LLM的潜在世界知识。

Result: SCOUT使Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct模型平均得分达0.86，显著优于Gemini-2.5-Pro（0.60），并节省约60%的GPU小时消耗。

Conclusion: SCOUT框架通过解耦探索与利用，显著提升了LLM在非语言环境中的表现，同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

Motivation: 传统监督式气候降尺度方法因缺乏配对训练数据和领域差异难以泛化到GCMs，而现有零样本方法存在物理不一致性和大尺度因子下的梯度消失问题。

Method: ZSSD利用从再分析数据中学习到的物理一致气候先验，结合地理边界和时间信息，确保物理有效性；并引入统一坐标指导策略，解决梯度消失问题。

Result: ZSSD在99百分位误差上显著优于现有零样本基线，并能成功重建复杂天气事件（如热带气旋）。

Conclusion: ZSSD框架通过结合物理一致的气候先验和统一坐标指导，显著提升了零样本统计降尺度的性能，成功解决了传统方法在GCMs上的泛化问题。

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

Result: 实验结果表明，基于LLM的方法在准确率和F1分数上比基线模型提高了约15-20%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个基于LLM的统一框架，用于视频活动识别和反馈生成，显著提升了识别准确率和F1分数，并为护理教育提供了可扩展、可解释的数据驱动基础。

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Result: 在各种6G应用场景中的案例研究和性能评估证明了CORE的有效性，显著提高了系统效率和任务完成率。

Conclusion: CORE框架通过在实际边缘计算平台上的部署验证了其适用性，展示了在操作环境中的稳健性能。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Conclusion: KnowBias 提供了一种轻量级且概念新颖的去偏框架，通过增强而非抑制与偏见知识相关的神经元，实现了高效的去偏效果，同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

TL;DR: WebArbiter通过文本生成和两阶段训练，解决了现有WebPRMs的局限性，显著提升了Web导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WebPRMs在Web导航任务中存在信号粗粒度、模板匹配脆弱等问题，导致监督稀疏且延迟，无法有效支持推理时扩展。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：首先通过推理蒸馏使模型具备原则指导的推理能力，然后通过强化学习直接对齐裁决与正确性。

Result: 在WebPRMBench上，WebArbiter-7B比最强基线GPT-5高出9.1分；在WebArena-Lite上，比最佳现有WebPRM高出7.2分。

Conclusion: WebArbiter通过引入基于文本生成的奖励模型和两阶段训练流程，显著提升了Web导航任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

Conclusion: 论文提出了Trap²框架，通过权重重新缩放作为合并过程的简单代理，有效保护模型权重免受未经授权的合并，同时保持独立使用的有效性。

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

Motivation: 当前LLM后训练方法未模拟人类问题解决的两阶段认知过程，导致泛化能力不足和效率低下。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT)和Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL)框架，分别专注于抽象推理模式和任务适应优化。

Result: 在四个模型和八个基准测试中，CoMT和CCRL分别提高了2.19%和4.63%的性能，并显著减少训练时间和资源消耗。

Conclusion: CoMT和CCRL框架通过模拟人类认知的两阶段过程，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

Result: 在五个多跳推理基准测试中，ProRAG表现出优于现有方法的整体性能。

Conclusion: ProRAG框架通过细粒度的过程监督，在复杂长视野任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

Conclusion: JADE框架通过联合优化规划和执行，解决了现有范式中的战略-操作不匹配问题，显著提升了性能，并在动态工作流编排中实现了效率与效果的灵活平衡。

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Method: 提出了一种多智能体强化学习框架SCMA，包含分割智能体、评分智能体和推理智能体，通过选择性惩罚冗余块来优化推理过程。

Result: SCMA在多个模型规模上实现了响应长度减少11.1%至39.0%，同时准确率提升4.33%至10.02%。

Conclusion: SCMA框架通过多智能体强化学习有效减少了推理冗余，同时保持了关键推理逻辑，显著提升了大型推理模型的性能和交互体验。

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

Conclusion: AgenticSimLaw框架通过角色结构化和多代理辩论，为高风险决策任务提供了透明且可控的推理方法，适用于需要透明度和人类监督的任何审议性任务。

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Result: 在近47,000个工具上的评估结果表明，ToolWeaver显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ToolWeaver提出了一种新的生成式工具学习框架，通过将工具编码为分层序列，显著提高了可扩展性和泛化能力，为高级工具增强代理奠定了更坚实的基础。

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Conclusion: 研究表明，网页视觉属性如背景颜色对比度、项目大小、位置和卡片清晰度对网络代理的行为有显著影响，而字体样式、文本颜色和项目图像清晰度影响较小。

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

Motivation: 探讨现有评估方法（如二元强制选择提示）可能混淆真实偏好与协议人为因素的问题。

Method: 系统研究24种语言模型的SvR相关性，采用允许中立和弃权的偏好获取协议。

Result: 允许中立和弃权显著改善自愿陈述偏好与强制选择揭示偏好的相关性（Spearman秩相关），但进一步允许揭示偏好中的弃权导致相关性接近零或负值。系统提示引导在AIRiskDilemmas上未可靠改善SvR相关性。

Conclusion: SvR相关性高度依赖于协议设计，偏好获取方法需考虑不确定偏好。

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

Method: 基于状态转换模型，定义有效事件序列，自动检测并纠正事件流数据中的异常模式。

Result: 在K League 1（2024赛季）的数据中，VERSA检测到18.81%的事件存在逻辑不一致，并显著提高了跨提供者一致性和下游任务VAEP的稳健性。

Conclusion: VERSA框架显著提升了足球事件流数据的可靠性和下游任务（如VAEP）的性能，验证了数据完整性验证在数据驱动分析中的重要性。

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

TL;DR: RTL 是一种自适应剪枝框架，通过发现多个专门化子网络来应对数据异质性，性能优于现有方法且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设存在一个适用于所有输入的通用获胜票券，忽略了真实世界数据的异质性。

Method: 提出了 Routing the Lottery (RTL)，一种自适应剪枝框架，发现多个专门化的子网络（称为自适应票券），每个子网络针对特定类别、语义簇或环境条件进行优化。

Result: RTL 在多样数据集和任务中表现优于单模型和多模型基线，平衡准确率和召回率更高，同时参数数量比独立模型少10倍，且表现出语义对齐。此外，发现了子网络崩溃现象，并提出了一种子网络相似性评分，用于无标签诊断过度稀疏化。

Conclusion: RTL 重新定义了剪枝机制，将其视为模型结构与数据异质性对齐的手段，为更模块化和情境感知的深度学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

TL;DR: CAR-bench是一个评估车载助手领域LLM代理可靠性的新基准，揭示了当前模型在处理不确定性和自我意识方面的不足，前沿模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代理基准测试主要关注理想化设置下的任务完成情况，忽视了在现实世界、面向用户的应用中的可靠性。特别是在车载语音助手等场景中，用户常发出不完整或模糊的请求，导致代理需要通过对话、工具使用和策略遵守来管理不确定性。

Method: 研究团队提出了CAR-bench，一个用于评估多轮、工具使用LLM代理在车载助手领域中的一致性、不确定性处理和能力意识的基准。该环境包括LLM模拟用户、领域策略和58个相互连接的工具，覆盖导航、生产力、充电和车辆控制等功能。

Result: 基线结果显示，所有任务类型中偶尔成功和一致成功之间存在巨大差距。即使是前沿推理LLM，在歧义任务中的一致通过率也低于50%，且在幻觉任务中频繁违反策略或捏造信息以满足用户请求。

Conclusion: CAR-bench 揭示了当前大型语言模型（LLM）代理在现实世界应用中的可靠性不足，尤其是在处理不确定性、策略遵守和自我意识方面。前沿推理模型的表现在歧义任务和幻觉任务中表现不佳，强调了开发更可靠、自我意识更强的LLM代理的必要性。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

TL;DR: AWO框架通过将重复工具调用序列转化为元工具，优化代理工作流，减少LLM调用次数并提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理工作流通常需要多次迭代推理步骤和工具调用，导致高运营成本、端到端延迟以及因幻觉导致的失败，AWO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: AWO分析现有工作流轨迹，发现重复的工具调用序列并将其转化为元工具，这些元工具是确定性的、复合的工具，将多个代理动作捆绑为单个调用。

Result: 在两个代理AI基准测试中，AWO将LLM调用次数减少了11.9%，任务成功率提高了4.2个百分点。

Conclusion: AWO框架通过优化冗余工具执行模式，显著提升了代理工作流的效率和鲁棒性，减少了LLM调用次数并提高了任务成功率。

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

TL;DR: SMB-Structure结合JEPA和SFT，有效模拟患者动态，优于传统LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）将患者视为待总结的文档而非动态系统，无法有效模拟患者状态随时间及干预措施的变化。

Method: 引入SMB-Structure，一种结构化电子健康记录（EHR）的世界模型，结合了JEPA和SFT。SFT用于重构未来患者状态的标记空间，而JEPA则在潜在空间中预测这些未来状态。

Result: 在Memorial Sloan Kettering和INSPECT两个大规模队列中验证，SMB-Structure通过学习捕捉疾病动态的嵌入，在患者异质性高的复杂任务中表现优于自回归基线。

Conclusion: SMB-Structure模型通过结合联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）和下一个标记预测（SFT），成功捕捉了患者轨迹的动态特性，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

TL;DR: Agent-RRM通过结构化反馈提升Agentic RL性能，Reagent-U策略效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于稀疏结果的奖励无法区分中间推理质量，导致训练效果不佳。

Method: 提出了Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM)，包含三种反馈信号，并系统研究了三种集成策略：Reagent-C、Reagent-R和Reagent-U。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，Reagent-U表现最佳，GAIA和WebWalkerQA分别达到43.7%和46.2%。

Conclusion: Agent-RRM通过提供结构化反馈（包括显式推理轨迹、针对性批评和整体评分），显著提升了Agentic RL的性能，尤其是在Reagent-U策略下表现突出。

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.
