However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViTMAlis\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9ViT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8eViT\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u7684MVA\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u52a0\u5267\u4e86ViT\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9ViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ViTMAlis\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2aViT\u539f\u751f\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u5378\u8f7d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u5171\u540c\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "ViTMAlis\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5378\u8f7d\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ViTMAlis\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5378\u8f7d\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The SCSP incurs content fetching costs while fetching and broadcasting the contents. The SCSP also incurs an age cost if users do not receive the most recent version of the content after requesting. We study a content fetching and broadcast problem, aiming to minimize the time-averaged content fetching and age costs. The problem can be framed as a Markov decision process but cannot be elegantly solved owing to its multi-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. To address this, we first obtain the optimal policy for the homogeneous case with all the users having the same request probability and age cost.

Conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when transitioning between distinct task scenarios, such as moving from dense urban clusters to sparse rural areas. These transitions typically necessitate computationally expensive retraining or model resets to adapt to new user distributions, leading to service interruptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient Spatiotemporal Continual Learning (STCL) framework realized through a Group-Decoupled Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (G-MAPPO) algorithm. Our approach integrates a novel Group-Decoupled Policy Optimization (GDPO) mechanism that utilizes dynamic $z$-score normalization to autonomously balance heterogeneous objectives, including energy efficiency, user fairness, and coverage. This mechanism effectively mitigates gradient conflicts induced by concept drifts without requiring offline retraining. Furthermore, the framework leverages the 3D mobility of UAVs as a spatial compensation layer, enabling the swarm to autonomously adjust altitudes to accommodate extreme density fluctuations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed STCL framework achieves superior resilience, characterized by an elastic recovery of service reliability to approximately 0.95 during phase transitions.

Volumetric representations occupy 3D space and have a large effective receptive field along rays, enabling stable and efficient optimization via volumetric rendering; however, subsequent meshing often produces overly dense meshes and introduces accumulated errors. In contrast, pure surface methods avoid meshing but capture only boundary geometry with a single-layer receptive field, making it difficult to learn intricate geometric details and increasing reliance on priors (e.g., shading or normals). We bridge this gap by differentiably turning a surface representation into a volumetric one, enabling end-to-end surface reconstruction via volumetric rendering to model complex geometries. Specifically, we soften a mesh into multiple semi-transparent layers that remain differentiable with respect to the base mesh, endowing it with a controllable 3D receptive field.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software engineering workflows for tasks including code generation, summarization, repair, and testing.

Eisenstein-Jacobi (EJ) networks, with their symmetric 6-regular topology, offer superior topological properties but challenge traditional routing heuristics under fault conditions. This paper evaluates three routing paradigms in faulty EJ environments: deterministic Greedy Adaptive Routing, theoretically optimal Dijkstra's algorithm, and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach. Using a multi-objective reward function to penalize fault proximity and reward path efficiency, the RL agent learns to navigate around clustered failures that typically induce dead-ends in greedy geometric routing. Dijkstra's algorithm establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by computing globally optimal paths with complete topology knowledge, revealing the true connectivity limits of faulty networks. Quantitative analysis at nine faulty nodes shows greedy routing catastrophically degrades to 10% effective reachability and packet delivery, while Dijkstra proves 52-54% represents the topological optimum. The RL agent achieves 94% effective reachability and 91% packet delivery, making it suitable for distributed deployment. Furthermore, throughput evaluations demonstrate that RL sustains over 90% normalized throughput across all loads, actually outperforming Dijkstra under congestion through implicit load balancing strategies. These results establish RL-based adaptive policies as a practical solution that bridges the gap between greedy's efficiency and Dijkstra's optimality, providing robust, self-healing communication in fault-prone interconnection networks without requiring the global topology knowledge or computational overhead of optimal algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6545\u969cEJ\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6838\u67b6\u6784\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u6545\u969c\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u3002Eisenstein-Jacobi\uff08EJ\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5bf9\u79f06-\u6b63\u5219\u62d3\u6251\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8def\u7531\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d2a\u5a6a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7684Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u60e9\u7f5a\u6545\u969c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e76\u5956\u52b1\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u8282\u70b9\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d2a\u5a6a\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5305\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7387\u964d\u81f310%\uff0cDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u62d3\u6251\u6700\u4f18\u4e3a52-54%\uff0c\u800cRL\u4ee3\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8694%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c91%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5305\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7387\u3002RL\u5728\u62e5\u585e\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8eDijkstra\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6545\u969c\u591a\u53d1\u7684\u4e92\u8fde\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u8def\u7531\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0eDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \\textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \\textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames.

Quantifying Interaction Effects in Peer Review", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u503e\u5411\u63a5\u53d7\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u662f\u5426\u5bf9LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bba\u6587\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81eaICLR\u3001NeurIPS\u548cICML\u7684125,000\u591a\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587-\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u3002LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5143\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8bba\u6587\u66f4\u4e3a\u5bbd\u5bb9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u504f\u597d\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u7531LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8bba\u6587\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

DRL yields demonstrated efficacy in various resource allocation problems, such as joint decisions on user scheduling and antenna allocation or simultaneous control of computing resources and modulation. However, trained DRL agents are closed-boxes and inherently difficult to explain, which hinders their adoption in production settings. In this paper, we make a step towards removing this critical barrier by presenting SymbXRL, a novel technique for explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) that synthesizes human-interpretable explanations for DRL agents. SymbXRL leverages symbolic AI to produce explanations where key concepts and their relationships are described via intuitive symbols and rules; coupling such a representation with logical reasoning exposes the decision process of DRL agents and offers more comprehensible descriptions of their behaviors compared to existing approaches. We validate SymbXRL in practical network management use cases supported by DRL, proving that it not only improves the semantics of the explanations but also paves the way for explicit agent control: for instance, it enables intent-based programmatic action steering that improves by 12% the median cumulative reward over a pure DRL solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "SymbXRL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7AI\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u89c2\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafDRL\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1DRL\u57286G\u7f51\u7edc\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002SymbXRL\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "SymbXRL\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7AI\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63cf\u8ff0\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u63ed\u793aDRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SymbXRL\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u7528\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u884c\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SymbXRL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DRL\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u7eafDRL\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612%\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7d2f\u79ef\u5956\u52b1\u3002"}}

We introduce DevOps-Gym, the first end-to-end benchmark for evaluating AI agents across core DevOps workflows: build and configuration, monitoring, issue resolving, and test generation.

We develop a semi-automated data collection mechanism with rigorous and non-trivial expert efforts in ensuring the task coverage and quality. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models and agents reveals fundamental limitations: they struggle with issue resolving and test generation in Java and Go, and remain unable to handle new tasks such as monitoring and build and configuration.

This paper presents maxwait, a simple coordination mechanism with surprising generality that makes these tradeoffs explicit and configurable. We demonstrate that this mechanism subsumes classical distributed system methods such as PTIDES, Chandy-and-Misra with or without null messages, Jefferson's Time-Warp, and Lamport's time-based fault detection, while enabling real-time behavior in distributed cyber-physical applications. The mechanism can also realize many commonly used distributed system patterns, including logical execution time (LET), publish and subscribe, actors, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and remote procedure calls with futures. More importantly, it adds to these mechanisms better control over timing, bounded time fault detection, and the option of making them more deterministic, all within a single semantic framework.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u662f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5ffd\u7565\u957f\u671f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u64a4\u9500\u66f4\u6539\u6216\u5f15\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u6761\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u591a\u8f6e\u8eab\u4efd\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684DiT\u89e3\u4ee4\u724c\u5668\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u591a\u8f6e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u4ece\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "EPDDL \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e DEL \u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0a\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 DEL \u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u62bd\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65b0\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86 EPDDL \u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "EPDDL \u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u5f53\u524d\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u6709\u7528\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EPDDL \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684 PDDL-like \u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 DEL \u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining.

Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics.

Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5708\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u8f68\u8ff9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5708\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe20.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u5708\u901f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u534720.7%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this model, an adversary gives an enumeration of example strings from an unknown target language, and the algorithm is tasked with correctly generating unseen strings from the target language within finite time. Refined notions of non-uniform and uniform generation were later introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari (2025), and a noisy model was introduced by Raman and Raman (2025), which allows the adversary to insert extraneous strings. A natural question in the noisy model is to quantify the effect of noise, by studying the impact of each additional extraneous string. We show two complementary results in this setting.

Then, we show for both uniform and non-uniform generation that generation with a single noisy string is equivalent to generation with any finite amount of noise, sharply contrasting with the strict hierarchy for noisy generation in the limit shown by Bai, Panigrahi, and Zhang (2026).

Traditional distributed PSKY methodologies predominantly rely on pre-defined static thresholds to filter local candidates. However, these rigid approaches are fundamentally ill-suited for the highly volatile and heterogeneous nature of edge computing environments, often leading to either severe communication bottlenecks or excessive local computational latency. To resolve this resource conflict, this paper presents SA-PSKY, a novel Self-Adaptive framework designed for distributed edge-cloud collaborative systems. We formalize the dynamic threshold adjustment problem as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to autonomously optimize filtering intensities in real-time. By intelligently analyzing multi-dimensional system states, including data arrival rates, uncertainty distributions, and instantaneous resource availability, our framework effectively minimizes a joint objective function of computation and communication costs.

A Critical Analysis of Systematic Literature Reviews on Agile Effort and Cost Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Background: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have become prevalent in software engineering research. Several researchers may conduct SLRs on similar topics without a prospective register for SLR protocols. However, even ignoring these unavoidable duplications of effort in the simultaneous conduct of SLRs, the proliferation of overlapping and often repetitive SLRs indicates that researchers are not extensively checking for existing SLRs on a topic. Given how effort-intensive it is to design, conduct, and report an SLR, the situation is less than ideal for software engineering research. Aim: To understand how authors justify additional SLRs on a topic. Method: To illustrate the issue and develop suggestions for improvement to address this issue, we have intentionally picked a sufficiently narrow but well-researched topic, i.e., effort estimation in Agile software development. We identify common justification patterns through a qualitative content analysis of 18 published SLRs. We further consider the citation data, publication years, publication venues, and the quality of the SLRs when interpreting the results. Results: The common justification patterns include authors claiming gaps in coverage, methodological limitations in prior studies, temporal obsolescence of previous SLRs, or rapid technological and methodological advancements necessitating updated syntheses. Conclusion: Our in-depth analysis of SLRs on a fairly narrow topic provides insights into SLRs in software engineering in general. By emphasizing the need for identifying existing SLRs and for justifying the undertaking of further SLRs, both in design and review guidelines and as a policy of conferences and journals, we can reduce the likelihood of duplication of effort and increase the rate of progress in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57dfSLRs\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u8bba\u8bc1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u8986\u76d6\u7a7a\u767d\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u65f6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709SLRs\u548c\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4f5c\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u8bba\u8bc1\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e00\u4e3b\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916SLRs\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u7684SLRs\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u679018\u7bc7\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684SLRs\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f15\u7528\u6570\u636e\u3001\u51fa\u7248\u5e74\u4efd\u3001\u51fa\u7248\u573a\u6240\u53caSLRs\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u8bfb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u4f5c\u8005\u58f0\u79f0\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\u3001\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u5148\u524dSLRs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u6280\u672f\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u6b65\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u72ed\u7a84\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLRs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6307\u5357\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709SLRs\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65SLRs\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c\u671f\u520a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \\emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.\n  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.\n  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\\sim5\\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\\times$ wall-time speedup).", "AI": {"tldr": "Ira\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8282\u70b9\u4f20\u8f93\u7d27\u51d1\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5907\u4efd\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u653e\uff0c\u5728\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b025\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u7684primary-backup\u590d\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u5907\u4efd\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u653e\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u91cd\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4e3b\u8282\u70b9\u5df2\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u672a\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b63\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u653e\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIra\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8282\u70b9\u4f20\u8f93\u5305\u542b\u672a\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5907\u4efd\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aIra-L\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u533a\u5757\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "result": "Ira-L\u5728\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e3b\u7f51\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u7d27\u51d1\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u5757\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u589e\u52a047KB\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u5907\u4efd\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u653e\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534725\u500d\uff0c\u603b\u91cd\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece6.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u964d\u81f316\u5206\u949f\uff0823.6\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Ira\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5907\u4efd\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u91cd\u653e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cIra-L\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.

However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection.

Traditionally, metamodels that describe these domains are created manually by system designers, forming the basis for iterative software development. This paper explores the partial automation of metamodel generation using generative AI, particularly for producing domain-specific JSON objects. By training a model on real-world DDD project data, we demonstrate that generative AI can produce syntactically correct JSON objects based on simple prompts, offering significant potential for streamlining the design process. To address resource constraints, the AI model was fine-tuned on a consumer-grade GPU using a 4-bit quantized version of Code Llama and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Despite limited hardware, the model achieved high performance, generating accurate JSON objects with minimal post-processing. This research illustrates the viability of incorporating generative AI into the DDD process, improving efficiency and reducing resource requirements, while also laying the groundwork for further advancements in AI-driven software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u5316DDD\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfDDD\u4e2d\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u75284\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u7684Code Llama\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684JSON\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684JSON\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9886\u57df\u9a71\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08DDD\uff09\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Standard First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) policies suffer from severe head-of-line blocking, leading to high tail latency and underutilized hardware. We introduce EWSJF (Effective Workload-based Shortest Job First), an adaptive request-level scheduler that learns workload structure in real time to jointly improve fairness and throughput. EWSJF operates upstream of execution-level schedulers and integrates four components: (1) Refine-and-Prune, an unsupervised partitioning algorithm that discovers performance-homogeneous request groups; (2) Dynamic Queue Routing for assigning requests to these groups; (3) Density-Weighted Scoring, a context-aware prioritization function balancing urgency and fairness; and (4) Bayesian Meta-Optimization, which continuously tunes scoring and partitioning parameters based on live performance feedback. Implemented in vLLM, EWSJF improves end-to-end throughput by over 30% and reduces average Time-To-First-Token for short requests by up to 4x compared to FCFS. These results demonstrate that adaptive, learning-based request scheduling is a critical missing layer for efficient and responsive LLM serving.

We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling.

Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions.

Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using a predefined protocol with clear eligibility criteria to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and minimized bias, synthesizing research on blockchain-enabled trust in AI-driven SE tools and processes. Results: Most studies focus on integrating AI in SE, with only 31% explicitly addressing trustworthiness. Our review highlights six recent studies exploring blockchain-based approaches to reinforce reliability, transparency, and accountability in AI-assisted SE tasks. Conclusion: Blockchain enhances trust by ensuring data immutability, model transparency, and lifecycle accountability, including federated learning with blockchain consensus and private data verification. However, inconsistent definitions of trust and limited real-world testing remain major challenges.

Given a set of $n$ locations, $h$ vehicles of identical capacity $\u03bb$ located at various depots, and $m$ ride requests each defined by a source and a destination, the goal is to plan non-preemptive routes that serve all requests while minimizing the total travel distance, ensuring that no vehicle carries more than $\u03bb$ passengers at any time. The best-known approximation ratio for the mDaRP remains $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt\u03bb\\log m)$.\n  We propose two simple algorithms: the first achieves the same approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt\u03bb\\log m)$ with improved running time, and the second attains an approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{m}\u03bb})$. A combination of them yields an approximation ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt[4]{n}\\log^{\\frac{1}{2}}n)$ under $m=\u0398(n)$.

While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness.

Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments.

Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions.

In this problem, we are given a depot and a set of customers, each with a demand, embedded in a metric space. The objective is to find a set of tours, each starting and ending at the depot, operated by the capacititated vehicle at the depot to serve all customers, such that all customers are served, and the total travel cost is minimized. We consider the unplittable variant, where the demand of each customer must be served entirely by a single tour. Let $\u03b1$ denote the current best-known approximation ratio for the metric traveling salesman problem. The previous best approximation ratio was $\u03b1+1+\\ln 2+\u03b4<3.1932$ for a small constant $\u03b4>0$ (Friggstad et al., Math. Oper. Res. 2025), which can be further improved by a small constant using the result of Blauth, Traub, and Vygen (Math. Program. 2023). In this paper, we propose two improved approximation algorithms. The first algorithm focuses on the case of fixed vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $\u03b1+1+\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y_0\\bigr)<3.0897$, where $y_0>0.39312$ is the unique root of $\\ln\\bigl(2-\\frac{1}{2}y\\bigr)=\\frac{3}{2}y$. The second algorithm considers general vehicle capacity and achieves an approximation ratio of $\u03b1+1+y_1+\\ln\\left(2-2y_1\\right)+\u03b4<3.1759$ for a small constant $\u03b4>0$, where $y_1>0.17458$ is the unique root of $\\frac{1}{2} y_1+ 6 (1-y_1)\\bigl(1-e^{-\\frac{1}{2} y_1}\\bigr) =\\ln\\left(2-2y_1\\right)$.

While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines.

To understand these problems and chart a path forward, we combined an in-depth survey of existing benchmarks with insights gathered from a dedicated community workshop.

To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/.

Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0897%\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c96% mAP\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5668\u68b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe97%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08mAP50-95\uff09\u4e3a96%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u543b\u5408\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks.

However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments.

Position paper", "summary": "This position paper argues that AI-assisted software engineering requires explicit mechanisms for tracking the epistemic status and temporal validity of architectural decisions. LLM coding assistants generate decisions faster than teams can validate them, yet no widely-adopted framework distinguishes conjecture from verified knowledge, prevents trust inflation through conservative aggregation, or detects when evidence expires. We propose three requirements for responsible AI-assisted engineering: (1) epistemic layers that separate unverified hypotheses from empirically validated claims, (2) conservative assurance aggregation grounded in the G\u00f6del t-norm that prevents weak evidence from inflating confidence, and (3) automated evidence decay tracking that surfaces stale assumptions before they cause failures.

However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \\textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \\textbf{C}entralized \\textbf{C}ritic and \\textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \\textbf{D}ecentralized \\textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model.

This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of bugs in real-world TypeScript projects. We analyze 633 bug reports from 16 popular open-source repositories to construct a taxonomy of fault types, quantify their prevalence, and relate them to project characteristics such as size, domain, and dependency composition. Our results reveal a fault landscape dominated not by logic or syntax errors but by tooling and configuration faults, API misuses, and asynchronous error-handling issues. We show that these categories correlate strongly with build complexity and dependency heterogeneity, indicating that modern failures often arise at integration and orchestration boundaries rather than within algorithmic logic. A longitudinal comparison with JavaScript studies shows that while static typing in TypeScript has reduced traditional runtime and type errors, it has shifted fragility toward build systems and toolchains.

We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF.

GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes.

To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u8f83\u5c11\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff08\u2018\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faEaE\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528LLM\u76d1\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165EaE\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "EaE\u5728BigCodeBench-Sabotage\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u63d0\u9ad816.8\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u5c11\u5373\u662f\u591a\u2019\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u53d6-\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08EaE\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002"}}

We learn control policies directly in a learned latent manifold that fuses (grammarizes) multiple modalities into a structured representation for policy decision-making. Building on GPU-accelerated physics simulation, we instantiate a set of single-shot manipulation tasks and achieve over 95% task success with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning in less than 1M environment steps, under continuously varying grasping conditions from step 1. This empirically shows faster convergence than representative state-of-the-art visual baselines under the same open-loop single-shot conditions. Our analysis indicates that explicitly reasoning in latent space yields more sample-efficient learning and improved robustness to novel object and gripper geometries, environmental clutter, and sensor configurations compared to standard baselines. We identify remaining limitations and outline directions toward fully adaptive and generalizable grasping in the extreme conditions of space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cSAC\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57281M\u6b65\u5185\u5b9e\u73b095%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eSoft Actor-Critic\uff08SAC\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u6b21\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6293\u53d6\u3002"}}

This paper presents an empirical study of 6,582 human-agent PRs (HAPRs) and 3,122 human PRs (HPRs) from the AIDev dataset. We compare HAPRs and HPRs along three dimensions: (i) testing frequency and extent, (ii) types of testing-related changes (code-and-test co-evolution vs. test-focused), and (iii) testing quality, measured by test smells. Our findings reveal that, although the likelihood of including tests is comparable (42.9% for HAPRs vs. 40.0% for HPRs), HAPRs exhibit a larger extent of testing, nearly doubling the test-to-source line ratio found in HPRs. While test-focused task distributions are comparable, HAPRs are more likely to add new tests during co-evolution (OR=1.79), whereas HPRs prioritize modifying existing tests. Finally, although some test smell categories differ statistically, negligible effect sizes suggest no meaningful differences in quality.

However, existing methods typically operate at a coarse-grained layer level, which often leads to a trade-off between injecting reasoning capabilities and preserving visual capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose {FRISM} (Fine-grained Reasoning Injection via Subspace-level model Merging), a fine-grained reasoning injection framework based on subspace-level model merging. Observing that reasoning capabilities are encoded in distinct subspaces, FRISM decomposes LRM task vectors via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and adaptively tunes the scaling coefficients of each subspace through learning to realize fine-grained reasoning injection. Furthermore, we introduce a label-free self-distillation learning strategy with a dual-objective optimization using common vision-language perception datasets.

We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.\n  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.\n  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses.

The stances conduct a cooperative debate and make policy by cross-checking their top candidates with cue-grounded arguments.

However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching.

A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery.

A well-known problem for the time integration of the equations of motion (EOM) is the lack of a singularity-free parameterization of spatial motions, which is usually tackled by using unit quaternions. Lie group integration methods were proposed as an alternative approach to the singularity-free time integration. At the same time, Lie group formulations of EOM naturally respect the geometry of spatial motions during integration. Lie group integration methods, operating directly on the configuration space Lie group, are incompatible with standard formulations of the EOM, and cannot be implemented in existing MBS simulation codes without a major restructuring. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) A framework for interfacing Lie group integrators to standard EOM formulations is presented. It allows describing MBS in terms of various absolute coordinates and at the same using Lie group integration schemes. (2) A method for consistently incorporating the geometry of rigid body motions into the evaluation of EOM in absolute coordinates integrated with standard vector space integration schemes. The direct product group and the semidirect product group SO(3)xR3 and the semidirect product group SE(3) are used for representing rigid body motions. The key element is the local-global transitions (LGT) transition map, which facilitates the update of (global) absolute coordinates in terms of the (local) coordinates on the Lie group. This LGT map is specific to the absolute coordinates, the local coordinates on the Lie group, and the Lie group used to represent rigid body configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a5\u53e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MBS\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5c0a\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u8fc7\u6e21\uff08LGT\uff09\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u5168\u5c40\u5750\u6807\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u79ef\u7fa4SO(3)xR3\u548c\u534a\u76f4\u79ef\u7fa4SE(3)\u6765\u8868\u793a\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u6807\u51c6EOM\u516c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u878d\u5165\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u7684EOM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u674e\u7fa4\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08EOM\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7edd\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u878d\u5165\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Using a vignette-based survey, we quantified the prevalence of these biases, identified the demographics most affected, assessed their consequences, and explored the motivations behind biased actions. Our results show that career development and task selection biases are the most prevalent forms, with over two-thirds of victims experiencing them multiple times. Women were more than three times as likely as men to face career development bias, task selection bias, and an unwelcoming environment. In parallel, individuals from marginalized ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately targeted by identity attacks.

This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments.

Existing approaches typically rely on representations extracted from pre-trained encoders, using two dominant types of features: global features, which summarize an entire image via a single pooled vector, and dense features, which preserve a patch-wise embedding from the final encoder layer. While widely used, both feature types mix task-relevant and irrelevant information, leading to poor generalization under distribution shifts, such as changes in lighting, textures, or the presence of distractors. In this work, we explore an intermediate structured alternative: Slot-Based Object-Centric Representations (SBOCR), which group dense features into a finite set of object-like entities. This representation permits to naturally reduce the noise provided to the robotic manipulation policy while keeping enough information to efficiently perform the task. We benchmark a range of global and dense representations against intermediate slot-based representations, across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging from simple to complex. We evaluate their generalization under diverse visual conditions, including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of distractors. Our findings reveal that SBOCR-based policies outperform dense and global representation-based policies in generalization settings, even without task-specific pretraining.

To increase the comprehensiveness of this problem, we investigate and evaluate the characteristics of LLM to know the pull requests' characteristics beyond the pass rate. We observe the code quality and maintainability within PRs based on code metrics to evaluate objective characteristics and developers' reactions to the pull requests from both humans and LLM's generation. Evaluation results indicate that LLM Agents frequently disregard code reuse opportunities, resulting in higher levels of redundancy compared to human developers.

Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored.

This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified.

Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (Springer)", "summary": "Code commits in a version control system (e.g., Git) should be atomic, i.e., focused on a single goal, such as adding a feature or fixing a bug. In practice, however, developers often bundle multiple concerns into tangled commits, obscuring intent and complicating maintenance. Recent studies have used Conventional Commits Specification (CCS) and Language Models (LMs) to capture commit intent, demonstrating that Small Language Models (SLMs) can approach the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining efficiency and privacy. However, they do not address tangled commits involving multiple concerns, leaving the feasibility of using LMs for multi-concern detection unresolved. In this paper, we frame multi-concern detection in tangled commits as a multi-label classification problem and construct a controlled dataset of artificially tangled commits based on real-world data. We then present an empirical study using SLMs to detect multiple semantic concerns in tangled commits, examining the effects of fine-tuning, concern count, commit-message inclusion, and header-preserving truncation under practical token-budget limits. Our results show that a fine-tuned 14B-parameter SLM is competitive with a state-of-the-art LLM for single-concern commits and remains usable for up to three concerns. In particular, including commit messages improves detection accuracy by up to 44% (in terms of Hamming Loss) with negligible latency overhead, establishing them as important semantic cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u68c0\u6d4bGit\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u768414B\u53c2\u6570SLM\u5728\u5355\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4e0b\u4e0eLLM\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e38\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u6346\u7ed1\u5230\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ef4\u62a4\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7528CCS\u548cLMs\u6355\u6349\u63d0\u4ea4\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u8ba8LMs\u5728\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u5305\u542b\u53ca\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u4fdd\u7559\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u768414B\u53c2\u6570SLM\u5728\u5355\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u4e0eLLM\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4e0b\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5305\u542b\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0844%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u768414B\u53c2\u6570\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u5728\u5355\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u591a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u63d0\u4ea4\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5305\u542b\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8644%\uff08\u4ee5\u6c49\u660e\u635f\u5931\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance.

Effective integration of 4D radar with cameras requires accurate extrinsic calibration, and the development of radar-based perception algorithms demands large-scale annotated datasets. However, existing calibration methods often employ separate targets optimized for either visual or radar modalities, complicating correspondence establishment. Furthermore, manually labeling sparse radar data is labor-intensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose 4D-CAAL, a unified framework for 4D radar-camera calibration and auto-labeling. Our approach introduces a novel dual-purpose calibration target design, integrating a checkerboard pattern on the front surface for camera detection and a corner reflector at the center of the back surface for radar detection. We develop a robust correspondence matching algorithm that aligns the checkerboard center with the strongest radar reflection point, enabling accurate extrinsic calibration. Subsequently, we present an auto-labeling pipeline that leverages the calibrated sensor relationship to transfer annotations from camera-based segmentations to radar point clouds through geometric projection and multi-feature optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy while significantly reducing manual annotation effort, thereby accelerating the development of robust multi-modal perception systems for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "4D-CAAL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u76844D\u96f7\u8fbe-\u76f8\u673a\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7528\u9014\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5355\u72ec\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u7acb\u590d\u6742\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u758f\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u8d39\u65f6\u53c8\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u7528\u9014\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u524d\u8868\u9762\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u56fe\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u540e\u8868\u9762\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89d2\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u96f7\u8fbe\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u96f7\u8fbe\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "4D-CAAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u53cc\u7528\u9014\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864D\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5916\u5728\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We study the usage patterns of 147 professional developers, examining perceived correlates of AI tools use, the resulting productivity and quality outcomes, and developer readiness for emerging AI-enhanced development. We describe a virtuous adoption cycle where frequent and broad AI tools use are the strongest correlates of both Perceived Productivity (PP) and quality, with frequency strongest. The study finds no perceptual support for the Quality Paradox and shows that PP is positively correlated with Perceived Code Quality (PQ) improvement. Developers thus report both productivity and quality gains. High current usage, breadth of application, frequent use of AI tools for testing, and ease of use correlate strongly with future intended adoption, though security concerns remain a moderate and statistically significant barrier to adoption. Moreover, AI testing tools' adoption lags that of coding tools, opening a Testing Gap. We identify three developer archetypes (Enthusiasts, Pragmatists, Cautious) that align with an innovation diffusion process wherein the virtuous adoption cycle serves as the individual engine of progression. Our findings reveal that organizational adoption of AI tools follows such a process: Enthusiasts push ahead with tools, creating organizational success that converts Pragmatists. The Cautious are held in organizational stasis: without early adopter examples, they don't enter the virtuous adoption cycle, never accumulate the usage frequency that drives intent, and never attain high efficacy. Policy itself does not predict individuals' intent to increase usage but functions as a marker of maturity, formalizing the successful diffusion of adoption by Enthusiasts while acting as a gateway that the Cautious group has yet to reach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u826f\u6027\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u987e\u8651\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u91c7\u7528\u6ede\u540e\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9075\u5faa\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6807\u5fd7\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5b9e\u8df5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u610f\u613f\u548c\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9147\u540d\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174AI\u589e\u5f3a\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9891\u7e41\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff08PP\uff09\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff08PQ\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5448\u6700\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u987e\u8651\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff08\u70ed\u60c5\u8005\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u3001\u8c28\u614e\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u826f\u6027\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u987e\u8651\u4ecd\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4e14\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u6ede\u540e\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9075\u5faa\u521b\u65b0\u6269\u6563\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d'\u70ed\u60c5\u8005'\u63a8\u52a8\u91c7\u7528\uff0c'\u5b9e\u7528\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005'\u968f\u540e\u8ddf\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c'\u8c28\u614e\u8005'\u5219\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e9\u671f\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u793a\u8303\u800c\u505c\u6ede\u4e0d\u524d\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training.

To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\\% to 67.3\\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5b9a\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u91d1\u878d-PoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5b9a\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u2018\u7b97\u672f\u5e7b\u89c9\u2019\u548c\u2018\u8ba4\u77e5\u5d29\u6e83\u2019\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u91d1\u878d-PoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u4e25\u683c\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u7684Python\u6c99\u7bb1\u4e2d\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CCB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06Qwen3-235B\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece59.7%\u63d0\u5347\u81f367.3%\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u500d\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u8026\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u91d1\u878d\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, existing data collection and skill learning systems for dexterous manipulation often suffer from low-dimensional tactile information. To address this limitation, we propose DexTac, a visuo-tactile manipulation learning framework based on kinesthetic teaching. DexTac captures multi-dimensional tactile data-including contact force distributions and spatial contact regions-directly from human demonstrations. By integrating these rich tactile modalities into a policy network, the resulting contact-aware agent enables a dexterous hand to autonomously select and maintain optimal contact regions during complex interactions. We evaluate our framework on a challenging unimanual injection task. Experimental results demonstrate that DexTac achieves a 91.67% success rate. Notably, in high-precision scenarios involving small-scale syringes, our approach outperforms force-only baselines by 31.67%.

While existing research has explored developer-AI interactions when programming qualitatively, a significant gap remains in quantitative analysis of developers' acceptance of AI-generated code suggestions, partly because the necessary fine-grained interaction data is often proprietary. To bridge this gap, this paper conducts an empirical study using 66,329 industrial developer-AI interactions from a large technology company. We analyze features that are significantly different between accepted code suggestions and rejected ones. We find that accepted suggestions are characterized by significantly higher historical acceptance counts and ratios for both developers and projects, longer generation intervals, shorter preceding code context in the project, and older IDE versions. Based on these findings, we introduce CSAP (Code Suggestion Acceptance Prediction) to predict whether a developer will accept the code suggestion before it is displayed. Our evaluation of CSAP shows that it achieves the accuracy of 0.973 and 0.922 on imbalanced and balanced dataset respectively. Compared to a large language model baseline and an in-production industrial filter, CSAP relatively improves the accuracy by 12.6\\% and 69.5\\% on imbalanced dataset, and improves the accuracy by 87.0\\% and 140.1\\% on balanced dataset. Our results demonstrate that targeted personalization is a powerful approach for filtering out code suggestions with predicted rejection and reduce developer interruption. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first quantitative study of code suggestion acceptance on large-scale industrial data, and this work also sheds light on an important research direction of AI-assisted programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCSAP\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0eAI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e13\u6709\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679066,329\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0eAI\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CSAP\uff08\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u63a5\u53d7\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "CSAP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.973\u548c0.922\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612.6%\u548c69.5%\uff08\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca87.0%\u548c140.1%\uff08\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u662f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u9884\u6d4b\u4f1a\u88ab\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u5efa\u8bae\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations.

Existing learning-based methods, while capable of inferring the presence of hidden agents, often produce redundant occupancy predictions where a single agent is identified multiple times. This issue complicates downstream planning and increases computational load. To address this, we introduce MatchInformer, a novel transformer-based approach that builds on the state-of-the-art SceneInformer architecture. Our method improves upon prior work by integrating Hungarian Matching, a state-of-the-art object matching algorithm from object detection, into the training process to enforce a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and ground truth, thereby reducing redundancy. We further refine trajectory forecasts by decoupling an agent's heading from its motion, a strategy that improves the accuracy and interpretability of predicted paths. To better handle class imbalances, we propose using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate occupancy predictions. By considering all entries in the confusion matrix, MCC provides a robust measure even in sparse or imbalanced scenarios. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning about occluded regions and produces more accurate trajectory forecasts than prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "MatchInformer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u901a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u901a\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u5982\u884c\u4eba\u6216\u8f66\u8f86\uff09\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMatchInformer\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSceneInformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u822a\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528MCC\u8bc4\u4f30\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo Open Motion Dataset\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMatchInformer\u5728\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MatchInformer\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u4ea4\u901a\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Classical geometric approaches such as SLAM offer reliable localization but depend on detailed maps and cannot interpret human-targeted cues (e.g., signs, room numbers) essential for indoor reasoning. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduce semantic grounding but remain strictly reactive, basing decisions only on visible frames and failing to anticipate unseen intersections or reason about distant textual cues. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide richer contextual inference but suffer from high computational latency, making them unsuitable for real-time operation on embedded platforms. In this work, we present IROS, a real-time navigation framework that combines VLM-level contextual reasoning with the efficiency of lightweight perceptual modules on low-cost, on-device hardware. Inspired by Dual Process Theory, IROS separates fast reflexive decisions (System One) from slow deliberative reasoning (System Two), invoking the VLM only when necessary. Furthermore, by augmenting compact VLMs with spatial and textual cues, IROS delivers robust, human-like navigation with minimal latency. Across five real-world buildings, IROS improves decision accuracy and reduces latency by 66% compared to continuous VLM-based navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "IROS\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6162\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u5185\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e66%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u56fe\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5e27\u53cd\u5e94\uff0cVLMs\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIROS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5c04\u51b3\u7b56\uff08System One\uff09\u4e0e\u6162\u901f\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u63a8\u7406\uff08System Two\uff09\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8c03\u7528VLM\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7d27\u51d1\u578bVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u4e2d\uff0cIROS\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fde\u7eedVLM\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e66%\u3002", "conclusion": "IROS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5c04\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6162\u901f\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba4\u5185\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002"}}

We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs.\n  We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB.

But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6d41\u884c\u7684GeoGuessr\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u7403\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u73a9\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86800\u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86LLM-as-a-judge\u548cVLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cQwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Gemini\u548cGPT 5\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama\u548cQwen\uff09\u5728\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6781\u5dee\uff0c\u4ec5\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\\% and 2.0\\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\\% and 4.7\\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods.

To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent.

Detecting RPC Bugs in Ethereum Blockchain Client under Context", "comment": "The paper is accepted by ICSE 2026", "summary": "Blockchain clients are fundamental software for running blockchain nodes. They provide users with various RPC (Remote Procedure Call) interfaces to interact with the blockchain. These RPC methods are expected to follow the same specification across different blockchain nodes, providing users with seamless interaction. However, there have been continuous reports on various RPC bugs that can cause unexpected responses or even Denial of Service weakness. Existing studies on blockchain RPC bug detection mainly focus on generating the RPC method calls for testing blockchain clients. However, a wide range of the reported RPC bugs are triggered in various blockchain contexts. To the best of our knowledge, little attention is paid to generating proper contexts that can trigger these context-dependent RPC bugs.\n  In this work, we propose EthCRAFT, a Context-aware RPC Analysis and Fuzzing Tool for client RPC bug detection. EthCRAFT first proposes to explore the state transition program space of blockchain clients and generate various transactions to construct the context. EthCRAFT then designs a context-aware RPC method call generation method to send RPC calls to the blockchain clients. The responses of 5 different client implementations are used as cross-referring oracles to detect the RPC bugs. We evaluate EthCRAFT on real-world RPC bugs collected from the GitHub issues of Ethereum client implementations. Experiment results show that EthCRAFT outperforms existing client RPC detectors by detecting more RPC bugs. Moreover, EthCRAFT has found six new bugs in major Ethereum clients and reported them to the developers. One of the bug fixes has been written into breaking changes in the client's updates.

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions.

Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**.

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies.

While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACQO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578bRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u6392\u540d-\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u5355\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5927\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff08ACQO\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578bRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff08AQR\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6392\u540d-\u5206\u6570\u878d\u5408\uff08RSF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "ACQO\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ACQO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch.

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters.

The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e03\u6599\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SoftGym\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u6210\u529f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3002"}}

This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope.

Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network.

Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions.

These data can be used to develop and benchmark algorithms for mental workload estimation, feature extraction, and temporal modeling in realistic industrial HRC scenarios, and to investigate the influence of environmental factors such as lighting on eye-based workload markers.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAZELOAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u7167\u660e\uff09\u5bf9\u773c\u52a8\u8d1f\u8377\u6807\u8bb0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ec4\u88c5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c26\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f69\u6234Meta ARIA\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u4e0e\u4e24\u53f0\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u773c\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u3001\u73af\u5883\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6309\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5206\u7c7b\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GAZELOAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded the possibilities for generating BPMN models directly from natural language, building upon earlier text-to-process methods with enhanced capabilities in handling complex descriptions. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluations of LLM-generated process models. Current efforts either use LLM-as-a-judge approaches or do not consider established dimensions of model quality. To this end, we introduce BEF4LLM, a novel LLM evaluation framework comprising four perspectives: syntactic quality, pragmatic quality, semantic quality, and validity. Using BEF4LLM, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of open-source LLMs and benchmark their performance against human modeling experts. Results indicate that LLMs excel in syntactic and pragmatic quality, while humans outperform in semantic aspects; however, the differences in scores are relatively modest, highlighting LLMs' competitive potential despite challenges in validity and semantic quality. The insights highlight current strengths and limitations of using LLMs for BPMN modeling and guide future model development and fine-tuning. Addressing these areas is essential for advancing the practical deployment of LLMs in business process modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "BEF4LLM\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u5728BPMN\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6f5c\u529b\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210BPMN\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165BEF4LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u8bed\u6cd5\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u80dc\u4e00\u7b79\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728BPMN\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728BPMN\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8LLMs\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations", "comment": "21 pages, 17 figures. Appendix included", "summary": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(\u03c4> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($\u03c1= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u7eed\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u662f\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u8f6c\u53d8\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u4f2a\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u63a8\u65ad\u53d1\u80b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6cbf\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75be\u75c5\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u96f6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6062\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08\u03c4>0.78\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\u5f3a\u70c8\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u75be\u75c5\u4e0a\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u03c1=0.92\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u6cbf\u63a8\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u57fa\u8d28\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u9759\u6001\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u8865\u5145\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u8d23\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u673a\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65e5\u76ca\u5851\u9020\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c9f\u901a\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5931\u6548\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u95ee\u8d23\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e14\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u2018\u6cbb\u7406\u5b6a\u751f\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u627f\u8ba4\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u751a\u81f3\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002"}}

Existing HPSF methods often fail to make reliable mode transitions or sustain efficient driving in congested environments, owing to heuristic scene recognition and low-frequency control updates. To address the limitation, this paper proposes LAP, a large language model (LLM) driven, adaptive planning method, which switches between high-speed driving in low-complexity scenes and precise driving in high-complexity scenes, enabling high qualities of trajectory generation through confined gaps. This is achieved by leveraging LLM for scene understanding and integrating its inference into the joint optimization of mode configuration and motion planning. The joint optimization is solved using tree-search model predictive control and alternating minimization. We implement LAP by Python in Robot Operating System (ROS).

Using a literature review and thematic analysis, we curated exemplar folklore items (e.g., beliefs about where defects occur, the 10x developer legend, and technical debt). We analyzed their narrative form, symbolic meaning, occupational relevance, and links to knowledge areas in software engineering. To ground these concepts in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 industrial practitioners in Sweden to explore how such narratives are recognized or transmitted within their daily work and how they affect it. Synthesizing these results, we propose a working definition of software engineering folklore as informally transmitted, traditional, and emergent narratives and heuristics enacted within occupational folk groups that shape identity, values, and collective knowledge. We argue that making the concept of software engineering folklore explicit provides a foundation for subsequent ethnography and folklore studies and for reflective practice that can preserve context-effective heuristics while challenging unhelpful folklore.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u4fd7\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u8bbf\u8c08\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6c11\u4fd7\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u6d41\u4f20\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u795e\u8bdd\u3001\u4eea\u5f0f\u3001\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u6574\u7406\u6c11\u4fd7\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf912\u540d\u745e\u5178\u5de5\u4e1a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u4fd7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u8c61\u5f81\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6c11\u4fd7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u6c11\u65cf\u5fd7\u548c\u6c11\u4fd7\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cd\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u65e0\u76ca\u7684\u6c11\u4fd7\u3002"}}

In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input.

We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \\textbf{\\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \\textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound-based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration.

While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation.

However, the standard approach of repeatedly sampling trajectories from scratch is computationally expensive. While recent methods have attempted to mitigate costs using specialized value agents, they can suffer from model miscalibration and fail to generalize to modern agents that synthesize custom bash scripts as tools. In this paper, we introduce SWE-Replay, the first efficient and generalizable test-time scaling technique for modern agents without reliance on potentially noisy value estimates. SWE-Replay optimizes the scaling process by recycling trajectories from prior trials, dynamically choosing to either explore from scratch or exploit archived experience by branching at critical intermediate steps. This selection of intermediate steps is driven by the potential and reasoning significance of repository exploration, rather than external LLM-based quality estimates. Our evaluation shows that, on SWE-Bench Verified, SWE-Replay consistently outperforms naive scaling, reducing costs by up to 17.4% while maintaining or even improving performance by up to 3.8%.

A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity.

Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics.

To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification.

However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508).

Unlike prior surgical robot learning approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or thousands of demonstrations, we show that a lightweight action decoder policy like Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) can learn complex, long-horizon manipulation from less than 150 demonstrations using solely stereo endoscopic images, when equipped with our architecture. We evaluate our approach on the collaborative surgical task of bowel grasping and retraction, where a robot assistant interprets visual cues from a human surgeon, executes targeted grasping on deformable tissue, and performs sustained retraction. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the standard ACT baseline. Our results show that generalist VLAs fail to acquire the task entirely, even under standard in-distribution conditions. Furthermore, while standard ACT achieves moderate success in-distribution, adopting a supervised MoE architecture significantly boosts its performance, yielding higher success rates in-distribution and demonstrating superior robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, including novel grasp locations, reduced illumination, and partial occlusions.

To overcome these deep-rooted architectural problems, we introduce HMRMamba, a new paradigm for HMR that pioneers the use of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) for their efficiency and long-range modeling prowess. Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor. Second, the Motion-guided Reconstruction Network leverages this anchor to explicitly process kinematic patterns over time. By injecting this crucial temporal awareness, it significantly enhances the final mesh's coherence and robustness, particularly under occlusion and motion blur. Comprehensive evaluations on 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M benchmarks confirm that HMRMamba sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and temporal consistency while offering superior computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMRMamba\u901a\u8fc7SSMs\u548c\u53cc\u521b\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u98913D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4e2d\u95f43D\u59ff\u6001\u951a\u70b9\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "method": "1.

However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a \"perception-reasoning-planning\" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Drive-KD\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDrive-KD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u201c\u611f\u77e5-\u63a8\u7406-\u89c4\u5212\u201d\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u84b8\u998f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5355\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684InternVL3-1B\u6a21\u578b\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1142\u500d\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u534711.4\u500d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7cfb\u5217\u768478B\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-5.1\u3002", "conclusion": "Drive-KD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "GIQT\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684AG-ReID\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u7aef\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u79ef\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aAG-ReID\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGIQT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "GIQT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4fee\u6b63\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002"}}

While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.\n  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods.

In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs.

Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.", "AI": {"tldr": "CNRE\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4ee5\u8ffd\u6c42\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6574\u5408\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "CNRE\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u64ad\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u884c\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u94fe\u7684\u5185\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5206\u914d\u5230\u795e\u7ecf-\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u5408\u53d6\u3001\u6790\u53d6\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7406\u60f3\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCNRE\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CNRE\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.\n  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.\n  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.\n  Code Available at: https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/kapso", "AI": {"tldr": "KAPSO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u957f\u671f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ML\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "KAPSO\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408git-native\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5c42\u4e09\u5927\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MLE-Bench\u548cALE-Bench\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "KAPSO\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5b9e\u9a8c\u72b6\u6001\u4e22\u5931\u3001\u8c03\u8bd5\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728MLE-Bench\u548cALE-Bench\u4e0a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter.

Using a newly collected dataset from three individuals with chronic stroke, we compare adaptation strategies (head-only tuning, parameter-efficient LoRA adapters, and full end-to-end fine-tuning) and evaluate on held-out test sets that include realistic distribution shifts such as within-session drift, posture changes, and armband repositioning. Across conditions, healthy-pretrained adaptation consistently improves stroke intent detection relative to both zero-shot transfer and stroke-only training under the same data budget; the best adaptation methods improve average transition accuracy from 0.42 to 0.61 and raw accuracy from 0.69 to 0.78.

Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e93\u5b58KPIs\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u53cd\u6620\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5173\u952e\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\uff08KPIs\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5408\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e93\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u670d\u52a1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e93\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c7d\u8f66\u552e\u540e\u5e02\u573a\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0NeRFs\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u5efa\u7a7a\u5fc3\u6216\u788e\u7247\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5SVRaster\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6062\u590d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76NeRFs\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u91cf3D\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08IGD\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u4f53\u7d20\u6805\u683c\u5316\uff08SVRaster\uff09\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4eceSfM\u7279\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5c062D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u6a21\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u4f53\u7d20\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u5272\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7c07\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8695.8%\u7684\u6062\u590d\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u9690\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u591a\u6062\u590d\u4e8643%\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u906e\u63213D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%.

The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios.

Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency.

We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging.

Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Liquid Interfaces \u8303\u5f0f\u53ca LIP \u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u4ecd\u4ee5\u9759\u6001\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5408\u7ea6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP)\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u534f\u5546\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u77ed\u6682\u6027\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "Liquid Interfaces \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a5\u53e3\u6210\u4e3a\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u6301\u4e45\u6280\u672f\u5de5\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "Liquid Interfaces \u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable.

We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings.

The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries.

Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity.

Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.

Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates.

Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.\n  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency.

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization.

In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies.

However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "BA-solver\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548Flow Matching\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SideNet\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eNFEs\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fed\u4ee3ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4eNFEs\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "BA-solver\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u53cc\u951a\u70b9\u901f\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SideNet\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-256^2\u4e0a\uff0cBA-solver\u4ec5\u970010 NFEs\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e100+ NFEs Euler\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u57285 NFEs\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "BA-solver\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SideNet\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Flow Matching\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002"}}

Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce.

In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \\textit{how models think} rather than \\textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \\textbf{DAMI} (\\textbf{D}yn\\textbf{A}mic \\textbf{M}odel \\textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $\u03bb(q)$ to configure cognitive depth.

Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization.

Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones.

Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling.

In this work, we uncover a striking \"Paradox of Robustness\": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be \"brittle\" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably \"stable\" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts.

Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts.

However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities.

This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\\underline{LI}ff\\underline{O}rd \\underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion.

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next.

Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \\textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords.

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID.

Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels.

To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \\textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding.

In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \\textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts.

Our theoretical analysis, framed via mutual information and entropy, explains why early reasoning steps encode strong signals predictive of final correctness. Empirically, PoLR consistently matches or exceeds SC across GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24/25, and GPQA-DIAMOND, reducing token usage by up to 60% and wall-clock latency by up to 50%.

While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.

This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($\u03bb\\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($\u03b7_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$).

Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner.

Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a \"see-saw\", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|\u0394$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \\textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|\u0394$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \\textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \\textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|\u0394$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations.

Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a \"Granularity Rigidity\" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling \"densification on demand\" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states.

However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention.

However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset.

These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \\underline{A}c\\underline{t}ive Latent \\underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\\% accuracy and -3.3\\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents.

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale.

Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \\emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684SBST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53d1\u73b0IDP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6587\u6863\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4ee5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u5931\u8d25\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u91cd\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684SBST\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u4e1aIDP\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time.

However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies.

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships.

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding.

Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCAP\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u5dee\u5f02\u68c0\u6d4b\u540e\u95e8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u89e6\u53d1\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u540e\u95e8\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "TCAP\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548cEM\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTCAP\u5728\u591a\u79cdMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6210\u4e3aMLLM\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "TCAP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u540e\u95e8\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget.

However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation.

However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones.

We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards.

First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting.

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101.

However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u4e2a\u878d\u54083D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c3D SAR\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f7\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfcSDF\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u659c\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u878d\u54083D SAR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u54083D SAR\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u57ce\u5e02\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning.

We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \\modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements.

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception.

The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates.

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources.

With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings.

Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios.

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality.

Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \\textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time.

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u53c2\u8003\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e3D\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u57df\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u6a213D\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u75283D\u8d44\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u53c2\u8003\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c063D\u8d44\u4ea7\u6574\u5408\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e3D\u53c2\u8003\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e3D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points.

While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability.

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists.

However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to \"process hallucinations\", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($\u03c0$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation.

Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions", "comment": "26 pages, 31 figures, 13 tables. Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/vi-probe/", "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism.

Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \\textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \\textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \\textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\\% to 39.0\\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\\% to 10.02\\%.

Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1.

Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight.

The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "pMF\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8FID\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fapMF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u4f4e\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\uff09\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u901f\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684MeanFlow\uff09\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cpMF\u5728256x256\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff082.22 FID\uff09\u548c512x512\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff082.48 FID\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "pMF\uff08pixel MeanFlow\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5f00\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563/\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u63a8\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales.

Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences.

A Comprehensive Evaluation of User Interface Design Factors", "comment": null, "summary": "Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "VAF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7f51\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u80cc\u666f\u989c\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u504f\u597d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "VAF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a(i)\u53d8\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9879\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\uff1b(ii)\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u6eda\u52a8\u548c\u70b9\u51fb\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4f\u89c8\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b(iii)\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u51fb\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53ca\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08\u517148\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u30015\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c4\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u989c\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7f51\u9875\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u5982\u80cc\u666f\u989c\u8272\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5361\u7247\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u5b57\u4f53\u6837\u5f0f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($\u03c1$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $\u03c1$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9648\u8ff0-\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d7\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e8c\u5143\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u534f\u8bae\u4eba\u4e3a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a7624\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5141\u8bb8\u4e2d\u7acb\u548c\u5f03\u6743\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u613f\u9648\u8ff0\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff08Spearman\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5141\u8bb8\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u4e2d\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u6216\u8d1f\u503c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728AIRiskDilemmas\u4e0a\u672a\u53ef\u9760\u6539\u5584SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SvR\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions.

In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification.

In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAR-bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f66\u8f7d\u52a9\u624b\u9886\u57dfLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u9762\u5411\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u8bed\u97f3\u52a9\u624b\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u53d1\u51fa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9075\u5b88\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAR-bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8f66\u8f7d\u52a9\u624b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u73af\u5883\u5305\u62ecLLM\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u548c58\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3001\u5145\u7535\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u5076\u5c14\u6210\u529f\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406LLM\uff0c\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u4e5f\u4f4e\u4e8e50%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u8fdd\u53cd\u7b56\u7565\u6216\u634f\u9020\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "CAR-bench \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u9075\u5b88\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u524d\u6cbf\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures.

However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data.

Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity.

However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Agent-RRM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347Agentic RL\u6027\u80fd\uff0cReagent-U\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff1aReagent-C\u3001Reagent-R\u548cReagent-U\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReagent-U\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cGAIA\u548cWebWalkerQA\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523043.7%\u548c46.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "Agent-RRM\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Agentic RL\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728Reagent-U\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}
