However, existing IBM methods focus solely on maximizing blocking effectiveness, overlooking fairness across communities. To address this issue, we formalize fairness in IBM and justify Demographic Parity (DP) as a notion that is particularly well aligned with its semantics. Yet enforcing DP is computationally challenging: prior work typically formulates DP as a Linear Programming (LP) problem and relies on costly solvers, rendering them impractical for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a DP-aware objective while maintaining an approximately monotonic submodular structure, enabling efficient optimization with theoretical guarantees. We integrate this objective with blocking effectiveness through a tunable scalarization, yielding a principled fairness-effectiveness trade-offs. Building on this structure, we develop CELF-R, an accelerated seed selection algorithm that exploits approximate submodularity to eliminate redundant evaluations and naturally supports Pareto front construction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CELF-R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a $(1-1/e-\u03c8)$-approximate solution while maintaining high efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u963b\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u7684IBM\u65b9\u6cd5CELF-R\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DP\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709IBM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u963b\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709DP\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdDP\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5355\u8c03\u5b50\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u963b\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u79cd\u5b50\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5CELF-R\u3002", "result": "CELF-R\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u963b\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CELF-R\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86$(1-1/e-\u03c8)$-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This growth couples scheduling decisions with feasibility: a scheduler must minimize latency under a hard memory budget, yet the response lengths of requests are inherently unknown. While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.\n  In this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000.

The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cdRIS\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5171\u8c0b\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e0b\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u6b21\u51f8\u903c\u8fd1\uff08SCA\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6765\u51f8\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001RIS\u3001STAR-RIS\u3001H-RIS\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u5229\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210UAV-RIS\u3001STAR-RIS\u548cH-RIS\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5171\u8c0b\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Inspired by the human ability to leverage past observations for interpreting ongoing actions, we propose FrameCache, a training-free three-stage framework consisting of Screen, Cache, and Match. In the Screen stage, a multi-dimensional, quality-aware mechanism with adaptive thresholds dynamically selects informative frames; the Cache stage maintains a reference pool using a dynamic replacement-hit strategy, preserving both diversity and relevance; and the Match stage extracts behavioral features to perform motion-consistent reference matching for coherent animation guidance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that FrameCache consistently improves temporal coherence and visual stability while integrating seamlessly with diverse baselines. Despite these encouraging results, further analysis reveals that its effectiveness depends on baseline temporal reasoning and real-synthetic consistency, motivating future work on compatibility conditions and adaptive cache mechanisms.

Current recovery mechanisms are prohibitively slow, often requiring up to 10 minutes to reinitialize resources and reload massive model weights. We introduce KevlarFlow, a fault tolerant serving architecture designed to bridge the gap between hardware unreliability and service availability. KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "KevlarFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "KevlarFlow\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u91cf\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u548c\u540e\u53f0KV\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u5236\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "KevlarFlow\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u53473.1\u500d\uff0c99\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63d0\u53472.8\u500d\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347378.9\u500d\uff0c99\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u9996\u6b21\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u5347574.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "KevlarFlow\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

A Comparative Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions.

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths.

Among the factors contributing to this effect are the properties of urban materials, which differ from those in rural areas. To analyze their individual impact and to test new material configurations, a high-resolution simulation at the city scale is required. Estimating the current materials used in a city, including those on building facades, is also challenging. We propose HeatMat, an approach to analyze at high resolution the individual impact of urban materials on the UHI effect in a real city, relying only on open data. We estimate building materials using street-view images and a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to supplement existing OpenStreetMap data, which describes the 2D geometry and features of buildings. We further encode this information into a set of 2D maps that represent the city's vertical structure and material characteristics.

The highly distributed and interdependent nature of modern cloud-based systems often complicates RCA efforts, particularly for multi-hop fault propagation, where symptoms appear far from their true causes. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance automated RCA. However, their practical value for RCA depends on the fidelity of reasoning and decision-making. Existing work relies on historical incident corpora, operates directly on high-volume telemetry beyond current LLM capacity, or embeds reasoning inside complex multi-agent pipelines -- conditions that obscure whether failures arise from reasoning itself or from peripheral design choices.\n  We present a focused empirical evaluation that isolates an LLM's reasoning behavior. We design a controlled experimental framework that foregrounds the LLM by using a simplified experimental setting. We evaluate six LLMs under two agentic workflows (ReAct and Plan-and-Execute) and a non-agentic baseline on two real-world case studies (GAIA and OpenRCA). In total, we executed 48,000 simulated failure scenarios, totaling 228 days of execution time. We measure both root-cause accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning traces. We produce a labeled taxonomy of 16 common RCA reasoning failures and use an LLM-as-a-Judge for annotation. Our results clarify where current open-source LLMs succeed and fail in multi-hop RCA, quantify sensitivity to input data modalities, and identify reasoning failures that predict final correctness. Together, these contributions provide transparent and reproducible empirical results and a failure taxonomy to guide future work on reasoning-driven system diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e91\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4f7f\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u6545\u969c\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ee5\u7a81\u51fa\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08ReAct\u548cPlan-and-Execute\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4e8648,000\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8616\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u7ec8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary.

Game-based learning (GBL) and gamification offer engagement benefits, yet their comparative impact remains unclear. We present the first PRISMA-aligned systematic review and comparative synthesis of GBL and gamification in robotics education, analyzing 95 studies from 12,485 records across four databases (2014-2025). We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p < .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report.

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data.

We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%.

Their massive volume, resulting from fine-grained measurements collected across many cells over long time horizons, poses significant challenges for storage, transport, and large-scale analysis. In this letter, we show that common cellular KPIs can be efficiently compressed using standard lossy compression schemes based on prediction, quantization, and entropy coding, achieving substantial reductions in reporting overhead. Focusing on traffic volume KPIs, we first characterize their intrinsic compressibility through a rate-distortion analysis, showing that signal-to-noise ratios around 30 dB can be achieved using only 3-4 bits per sample, corresponding to an 8-10x reduction with respect to 32-bit floating-point representations. We then assess the impact of KPI compression on representative downstream analytics tasks. Our results show that aggregation across cells mitigates quantization errors and that prediction accuracy is unaffected beyond a moderate reporting rate. These findings indicate that KPI compression is feasible and transparent to network-level analytics in cellular systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edcKPI\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u62a5\u544a\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edcKPI\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u8702\u7a9dKPI\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u5931\u771f\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u97003-4\u6bd4\u7279/\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea630 dB\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e32\u4f4d\u6d6e\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e868-10\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "KPI\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u8702\u7a9d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u662f\u900f\u660e\u7684\u3002"}}

By learning extrusion sequences that assemble a mesh, similar to the way artists create meshes, our approach naturally supports arbitrary output face counts and produces manifold meshes by design, in contrast to recent transformer-based models. The learnt extrusion sequences can also be applied to existing meshes - enabling editing in addition to generation. To train our model, we decompose a library of quadrilateral meshes with non-self-intersecting face loops into constituent loops, which can be viewed as their building blocks, and finetune an LLM on the steps for reassembling the meshes by performing a sequence of extrusions.

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models. FlaXifyer requires only job execution logs and achieves 84.3% Macro F1 and 92.0% Top-2 accuracy with just 12 labeled examples per category. We also propose LogSift, an interpretability technique that identifies influential log statements in under one second, reducing review effort by 74.4% while surfacing relevant failure information in 87% of cases.

The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis.

We argue that this failure reflects a fundamental mismatch: step-wise reasoning induces a form of step-wise greedy policy that is adequate for short horizons but fails in long-horizon planning, where early actions must account for delayed consequences. From this planning-centric perspective, we study LLM-based agents in deterministic, fully structured environments with explicit state transitions and evaluation signals. Our analysis reveals a core failure mode of reasoning-based policies: locally optimal choices induced by step-wise scoring lead to early myopic commitments that are systematically amplified over time and difficult to recover from. We introduce FLARE (Future-aware Lookahead with Reward Estimation) as a minimal instantiation of future-aware planning to enforce explicit lookahead, value propagation, and limited commitment in a single model, allowing downstream outcomes to influence early decisions. Across multiple benchmarks, agent frameworks, and LLM backbones, FLARE consistently improves task performance and planning-level behavior, frequently allowing LLaMA-8B with FLARE to outperform GPT-4o with standard step-by-step reasoning.

In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing.

We identify this phenomenon as middle-phase thrashing, a previously under-characterized pathology in which cache efficiency collapses as long-lived agents accumulate state over time.\n  We argue that mitigating this pathology requires moving beyond reactive, request-level cache management to proactive, agent-level admission control. Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.\n  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CONCUR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u4ee3\u7406\u51c6\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GPU\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4ee3\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u5d29\u6e83\uff08\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u4ece\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee3\u7406\u7ea7\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "CONCUR\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7f13\u5b58\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u9650\u5236\u603b\u4f53\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u3002", "result": "CONCUR\u5728Qwen3-32B\u548cDeepSeek-V3\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad84.09\u500d\u548c1.9\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "CONCUR\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u6296\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5177\u6709\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\uff08\u975e\uff09\u7406\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u6216\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u7406\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u516c\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u201c\u601d\u8003\u201d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7406\u6027\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u671f\u671b\u503c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u60c5\u611f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7406\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u548cLLM\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models.

Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels.

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7801\u4e66\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u5339\u654c\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u5426\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u53cc\u5c42VQ-VAE\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u7f6e\u975e\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7801\u4e66\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u4f18\u7801\u4e66\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7801\u4e66\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u654c\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u7801\u4e66\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u654c\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

However, standard methods for solving multi-agent games fail to learn correct protocols in this setting, even when the number of agents is small. We propose a learning framework, GGMS, which integrates a specialized variant of Monte Carlo Tree Search with a transformer-based action encoder, a global depth-first search to break out of local minima, and repeated feedback from a model checker. Protocols output by GGMS are verified correct via exhaustive model checking for all executions within the bounded setting.

Existing solutions rely on specialized sensors: either heavy, costly airborne LiDAR, or Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), which uses thermal synthetic aperture photography and is tailored for person detection.\n  We introduce a novel approach for the reconstruction of canopy-free, photorealistic ground views using only conventional RGB images. Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\n  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images).

By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel.

To address GNSS limitations and the impracticality of camera-based visual positioning, the work proposes a particle filter based fusion of GNSS and inertial data that incorporates spatial priors from maps, such as impassable buildings and unlikely walking areas, functioning as a probabilistic form of map matching. Inertial localization is provided by the RoNIN machine learning method, and fusion with GNSS is achieved by weighting particles based on their consistency with GNSS estimates and uncertainty. The system was evaluated on six challenging walking routes in downtown San Francisco using three metrics related to sidewalk correctness and localization error. Results show that the fused approach (GNSS+RoNIN+PF) significantly outperforms GNSS only localization on most metrics, while inertial-only localization with particle filtering also surpasses GNSS alone for critical measures such as sidewalk assignment and across street error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02GNSS\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGNSS+\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGNSS\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6ee1\u8db3\u76f2\u4eba\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2dGNSS\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u76f2\u4eba\u6216\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u5982\u8857\u9053\u4fa7\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684GNSS\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u5efa\u7b51\u533a\u57df\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u3002\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7531RoNIN\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\uff0cGNSS\u878d\u5408\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u5e02\u533a\u516d\u6761\u590d\u6742\u8def\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GNSS+RoNIN+PF\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGNSS\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u4ec5\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ed3\u5408\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8de8\u8857\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u4e0a\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8eGNSS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408GNSS\u3001RoNIN\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u76f2\u4eba\u6216\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8857\u9053\u4fa7\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGNSS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning.

Crucially, the research demonstrates that high-pixel-count cameras yield high-quality point clouds only through the implementation of high-accuracy calibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5e27\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9ad8\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u4e0b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff085MP+\uff09\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e27\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u901f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u9ad8\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u673a\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u673a\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u3002"}}

We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

To address this challenge, we introduce CARE, a novel framework designed to train VLA models for robotic task execution. Unlike existing methods that depend on action annotations during pretraining, CARE eliminates the need for explicit action labels by leveraging only video-text pairs. These weakly aligned data sources enable the model to learn continuous latent action representations through a newly designed multi-task pretraining objective.

This study presents an automated personnel selection system that utilizes sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to assess and rank software engineering applicants. A distinctive dataset was created by aggregating LinkedIn profiles that include essential features such as education, work experience, abilities, and self-introduction, further enhanced with expert assessments to function as standards. The research combines large language models (LLMs) with multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) theory to develop the LLM-TOPSIS framework. In this context, we utilized the TOPSIS method enhanced by fuzzy logic (Fuzzy TOPSIS) to address the intrinsic ambiguity and subjectivity in human assessments. We utilized triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) to describe criteria weights and scores, thereby addressing the ambiguity frequently encountered in candidate evaluations. For candidate ranking, the DistilRoBERTa model was fine-tuned and integrated with the fuzzy TOPSIS method, achieving rankings closely aligned with human expert evaluations and attaining an accuracy of up to 91% for the Experience attribute and the Overall attribute. The study underlines the potential of NLP-driven frameworks to improve recruitment procedures by boosting scalability, consistency, and minimizing prejudice.

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.\n  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results.

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions.

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces AutoMerge, a framework to improve model merging across diverse architectures, highlighting limitations of current techniques.", "motivation": "To investigate whether model merging, a training-free approach successful in LLMs, can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains.", "method": "The study evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving domains, revealing inconsistencies and limitations.", "result": "Existing model merging techniques lead to inconsistent results, fail to handle heterogeneous structural properties, and are highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations.", "conclusion": "AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework, is proposed to address the limitations of existing model merging techniques by segmenting models into heterogeneous blocks and systematically exploring the merging space."}}

Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency.

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures.

Yet, traditional safety-case practices from aviation or nuclear engineering rely on well-specified system boundaries, stable architectures, and known failure modes. Modern AI systems such as generative and agentic AI are the opposite. Their capabilities emerge unpredictably from low-level training objectives, their behaviour varies with prompts, and their risk profiles shift through fine-tuning, scaffolding, or deployment context. This study examines how safety cases are currently constructed for AI systems and why classical approaches fail to capture these dynamics. It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods.

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency.

The final version will appear in the ACM Digital Library", "summary": "Boundary value analysis and testing (BVT) is fundamental in software quality assurance because faults tend to cluster at input extremes, yet testers often struggle to understand and justify why certain input-output pairs represent meaningful behavioral boundaries. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u8bc4\u4ef7\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08BVT\uff09\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5458\u5e38\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728BVT\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4e8627\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u5bf9GPT-4.1\u751f\u6210\u768420\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u540e\u7eed\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c63.5%\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u7684\uff085\u5206\u5236\u4e2d\u76844-5\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u800c17%\u662f\u6d88\u6781\u7684\uff081-2\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u53ef\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u6743\u5a01\u6765\u6e90\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u8bfb\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u8c03\u6574\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u6587\u6863\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

However, in tasks involving physical interaction with humans, users may still adopt awkward, non-ergonomic postures, which can lead to discomfort or injury over time. In this paper, we propose a novel control framework that provides kinesthetic feedback to SRB users when a non-ergonomic posture is detected, offering resistance to discourage such behaviors. This approach aims to foster long-term learning of ergonomic habits and promote proper posture during physical interactions. To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u865a\u62df\u5939\u5177\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u9002\u6216\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4e60\u60ef\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u865a\u62df\u5939\u5177\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u59ff\u52bf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4e0eSRB\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u6d6e\u52a8\u5e95\u5ea7\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u6d89\u53ca14\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u3002"}}

Personal use of this material is permitted. Permission from IEEE must be obtained for all other uses", "summary": "Interactive 3D model texture editing presents enhanced opportunities for creating 3D assets, with freehand drawing style offering the most intuitive experience. However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles.

While memory systems provide a viable solution, existing paradigms struggle to adapt to dynamic GUI environments, suffering from a granularity mismatch between high-level intent and low-level execution, and context pollution where the static accumulation of outdated experiences drives agents into hallucination. To address these bottlenecks, we propose the Darwinian Memory System (DMS), a self-evolving architecture that constructs memory as a dynamic ecosystem governed by the law of survival of the fittest. DMS decomposes complex trajectories into independent, reusable units for compositional flexibility, and implements Utility-driven Natural Selection to track survival value, actively pruning suboptimal paths and inhibiting high-risk plans. This evolutionary pressure compels the agent to derive superior strategies. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-app benchmarks validate that DMS boosts general-purpose MLLMs without training costs or architectural overhead, achieving average gains of 18.0% in success rate and 33.9% in execution stability, while reducing task latency, establishing it as an effective self-evolving memory system for GUI tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728GUI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u8de8\u5e94\u7528GUI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fbe\u5c14\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08DMS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u6548\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1DMS\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534718.0%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c33.9%\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "DMS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728GUI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional hardening tests, which pass at generation time, catching tests are meant to fail, surfacing bugs before code lands. The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity.

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer.

This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates.

Temperature- and truncation-based methods reshape the next-token distribution through global probability reweighting or thresholding to balance the quality-diversity tradeoff. However, they operate solely on token probabilities, ignoring fine-grained relationships among tokens in the embedding space. We uncover a novel phenomenon, embedding-space crowding, where the next-token distribution concentrates its probability mass on geometrically close tokens in the embedding space. We quantify crowding at multiple granularities and find a statistical association with reasoning success in mathematical problem solving. Motivated by this finding, we propose CraEG, a plug-and-play sampling method that mitigates crowding through geometry-guided reweighting.

Yet the community still lacks high-quality, publicly available datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and root cause analysis (RCA) in MSS. Most benchmarks emphasize performance-related faults and provide only one or two monitoring modalities, limiting research on broader failure modes and cross-modal methods. To address these gaps, we introduce a new multimodal anomaly dataset built on two open-source microservice systems: SocialNetwork and TrainTicket. We design and inject four categories of anomalies (Ano): performance-level, service-level, database-level, and code-level, to emulate realistic anomaly modes. For each scenario, we collect five modalities (Mod): logs, metrics, distributed traces, API responses, and code coverage reports, offering a richer, end-to-end view of system state and inter-service interactions. We name our dataset, reflecting its unique properties, as AnoMod.

By leveraging CLIP-encoded text prompts describing both normal and anomalous class-specific characteristics, our method enriches visual reconstruction with semantic context, improving the detection of subtle and textural anomalies. To further address the challenge of class imbalance at the pixel level, we incorporate Focal loss function, which emphasizes hard-to-detect anomalous regions during training. Our architecture also includes a supervised segmentor that fuses multi-scale convolutional features with Transformer-based spatial attention and diffusion iterative refinement, yielding precise and high-resolution anomaly maps.

However, existing frameworks often operate under the idealized assumption that tool executions are invariably successful, relying solely on textual descriptions that fail to distinguish precise performance boundaries and cannot adapt to iterative tool updates. This gap introduces uncertainty in planning and execution, particularly in domains like visual content generation (AIGC), where nuanced tool performance significantly impacts outcomes. To address this, we propose PerfGuard, a performance-aware agent framework for visual content generation that systematically models tool performance boundaries and integrates them into task planning and scheduling. Our framework introduces three core mechanisms: (1) Performance-Aware Selection Modeling (PASM), which replaces generic tool descriptions with a multi-dimensional scoring system based on fine-grained performance evaluations; (2) Adaptive Preference Update (APU), which dynamically optimizes tool selection by comparing theoretical rankings with actual execution rankings; and (3) Capability-Aligned Planning Optimization (CAPO), which guides the planner to generate subtasks aligned with performance-aware strategies. Experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate PerfGuard's advantages in tool selection accuracy, execution reliability, and alignment with user intent, validating its robustness and practical utility for complex AIGC tasks.

The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments.

A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video.

Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a promising direction by enabling iterative reasoning, tool use, and environment interaction to refine SAST alerts. However, the comparative effectiveness of different LLM-based agent architectures for FP filtering remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three state-of-the-art LLM-based agent frameworks, i.e., Aider, OpenHands, and SWE-agent, for vulnerability FP filtering. We evaluate these frameworks using the vulnerabilities from the OWASP Benchmark and real-world open-source Java projects. The experimental results show that LLM-based agents can remove the majority of SAST noise, reducing an initial FP detection rate of over 92% on the OWASP Benchmark to as low as 6.3% in the best configuration. On real-world dataset, the best configuration of LLM-based agents can achieve an FP identification rate of up to 93.3% involving CodeQL alerts. However, the benefits of agents are strongly backbone- and CWE-dependent: agentic frameworks significantly outperform vanilla prompting for stronger models such as Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5, but yield limited or inconsistent gains for weaker backbones. Moreover, aggressive FP reduction can come at the cost of suppressing true vulnerabilities, highlighting important trade-offs. Finally, we observe large disparities in computational cost across agent frameworks.

However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive \"generate-then-filter\" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms.

However, existing RLVR algorithms require large query budgets, making annotation costly. We investigate whether fewer but more informative queries can yield similar or superior performance, introducing active learning (AL) into RLVR. We identify that classic AL sampling strategies fail to outperform random selection in this setting, due to ignoring objective uncertainty when only selecting by subjective uncertainty. This work proposes an uncertainty consistency metric to evaluate how well subjective uncertainty aligns with objective uncertainty. In the offline setting, this alignment is measured using the Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (PBC). For online training, because of limited sampling and dynamically shifting output distributions, PBC estimation is difficult.

Theoretically, we prove that the online variant is strictly negatively correlated with offline PBC and supports better sample selection.

In practice, teams often draft multiple candidate proposals for fixing an issue and then deliberate on one golden proposal for implementation. This selection requires not only assessing the issue's scope, impact, and urgency, but also a clear understanding of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures.\n  We first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5.

While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills. We conduct experiments on 12 RLBench tasks, where our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 12.7% in average success rate. Further evaluation on six representative tasks demonstrates strong zero-shot view generalization, with success rate drops of only 22.0% and 29.7% under moderate and large viewpoint shifts respectively, whereas the state-of-the-art method suffers larger decreases of 41.6% and 51.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "MethodName\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8868\u793a-\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u89c6\u56fe3D\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u67093D\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MethodName\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MethodName\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u89c6\u56fe3D\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u524d\u9988\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u84b8\u998f\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2aRLBench\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMethodName\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad812.7%\uff1b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5c0f\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MethodName\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8868\u793a-\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, they often struggle with the rigorous requirements of smart contracts, frequently producing code that is buggy or vulnerable. To address this, we propose SolAgent, a novel tool-augmented multi-agent framework that mimics the workflow of human experts. SolAgent integrates a \\textbf{dual-loop refinement mechanism}: an inner loop using the \\textit{Forge} compiler to ensure functional correctness, and an outer loop leveraging the \\textit{Slither} static analyzer to eliminate security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the agent is equipped with file system capabilities to resolve complex project dependencies. Experiments on the SolEval+ Benchmark, a rigorous suite derived from high-quality real-world projects, demonstrate that SolAgent achieves a Pass@1 rate of up to \\textbf{64.39\\%}, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs ($\\sim$25\\%), AI IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot), and existing agent frameworks. Moreover, it reduces security vulnerabilities by up to \\textbf{39.77\\%} compared to human-written baselines.

We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%.

While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions.

To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss. Experiments on four benchmarks show that EntroCut reduces token usage by up to 40\\% with minimal accuracy sacrifice, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs compared with existing training-free methods. These results demonstrate that entropy-guided dynamic truncation provides a practical approach to mitigate the inefficiency of LRMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "EntroCut\u5229\u7528\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u71b5\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEntroCut\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEntroCut\u6700\u9ad8\u51cf\u5c1140%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u6548\u7387-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EntroCut\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u622a\u65ad\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners. Overall, Unshade identified 7,712 unique CVEs in hidden dependencies that would remain undetected when relying on metadata-based scanning alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unshade\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u626b\u63cf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6f0f\u6d1e\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "Unshade\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u7801\u6307\u7eb9\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3aJava\u9879\u76ee\u7684SBOM\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u7684SBOM\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cUnshade\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd150%\u7684\u6d41\u884cJava Maven\u9879\u76ee\u5305\u542b\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u9879\u76ee\u6709\u8d85\u8fc78\u4e2a\u6b64\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "Unshade\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u4f9d\u8d56\u626b\u63cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5143\u6570\u636e\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4fee\u6539\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u3002"}}

Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings.

However, existing approaches predominantly employ a single-agent framework to generate search branches and estimate rewards during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning. This single-agent paradigm inherently limits exploration capabilities, often resulting in insufficient diversity among generated branches and suboptimal planning performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Synergistic Multi-agent Planning with Heterogeneous langauge model assembly (SYMPHONY), a novel multi-agent planning framework that integrates a pool of heterogeneous language model-based agents. By leveraging diverse reasoning patterns across agents, SYMPHONY enhances rollout diversity and facilitates more effective exploration. Empirical results across multiple benchmark tasks show that SYMPHONY achieves strong performance even when instantiated with open-source LLMs deployable on consumer-grade hardware. When enhanced with cloud-based LLMs accessible via API, SYMPHONY demonstrates further improvements, outperforming existing state-of-the-art baselines and underscoring the effectiveness of heterogeneous multi-agent coordination in planning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SYMPHONY\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347MCTS\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728MCTS\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u652f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSYMPHONY\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6c60\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "SYMPHONY\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e91\u7aefLLMs\u540e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SYMPHONY\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u6c60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u548c\u4e91\u7aefLLMs\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e09\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728ABF\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u524d\u79fb\u9664\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6ce8\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c1\u89e3\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fee\u590d\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u6709\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u4e3a\u7f3a\u5c11\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0cABF\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u7c7b\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u5e2e\u52a9LLM\u51c6\u786e\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u5c24\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\uff08ABF\uff09\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space.\n  We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution.\n  LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "LG-Flow Policy \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u867d\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u4f46\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 LG-Flow Policy\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u70b9\u4e91\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8c03\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLG-Flow Policy \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "LG-Flow Policy \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u5f0f\u6d41\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Yu"], "title": "SHED Light on Segmentation for Dense Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision.

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced. While recent work shows that attack success increases with repeated sampling, principled methods for predicting large-scale adversarial risk remain limited. We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure.

Existing VR testing approaches enable scene navigation and interaction activation, but lack the ability to automatically synthesise realistic 3D user inputs (e.g, grab and trigger actions via hand-held controllers). Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects.

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation.

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context. Even as benchmark scores rise, generation-centric systems still show behaviours incompatible with clinical deployment: premature closure, unjustified certainty, intent drift, and instability across multi-step decisions.\n  We argue these are structural consequences of treating medicine as next-token prediction. We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.\n  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.\n  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines.

Although numerous automated microservice decomposition frameworks have been proposed, their evaluation is often fragmented due to inconsistent benchmark systems, incompatible metrics, and limited reproducibility, thus hindering objective comparison. This work presents a unified comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art microservice decomposition approaches spanning static, dynamic, and hybrid techniques. Using a consistent metric computation pipeline, we assess the decomposition quality across widely used benchmark systems (JPetStore, AcmeAir, DayTrader, and Plants) using Structural Modularity (SM), Interface Number(IFN), Inter-partition Communication (ICP), Non-Extreme Distribution (NED), and related indicators.

Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches.

We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "TMoW\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u578b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMixture-of-Experts\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "TMoW\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728VirtualHome\u3001ALFWorld\u548cRLBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTMoW\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "TMoW\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8def\u7531\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status.

However, existing RL paradigms such as GRPO often suffer from Advantage Bias due to binary decision spaces and static uncertainty rewards, inducing either excessive conservatism or overconfidence. To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework.

Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrepRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u65e0\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GrepRAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86ripgrep\u547d\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u548c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "GrepRAG\u5728CrossCodeEval\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.04-15.58%\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GrepRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u6392\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u91cd\uff09\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CrossCodeEval\u548cRepoEval-Updated\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter.

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference.

However, existing approaches often overlook the specialization differences among available models, treating all LLMs as uniformly applicable regardless of task characteristics. This limits their ability to adapt to varying reasoning demands and task complexities. In this work, we propose Task-Aware LLM Council (TALC), a task-adaptive decision framework that integrates a council of LLMs with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enable dynamic expert selection and efficient multi-step planning. Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence.

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "O-CRD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faO-CRD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u9006\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u4fee\u590d\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u590d\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8def\u5f84\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u4ef6/\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Bench Lite\u4e0a\uff0cPass@1\u63d0\u534710.4%\uff08GPT-4o\uff09\u30018.6%\uff08DeepSeek-V3\uff09\u548c10.3%\uff08GPT-5\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7O-CRD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5411\u524d\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality.

Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process.

Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowCalib\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4bLiDAR\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u65cb\u8f6c\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5355\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "FlowCalib\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u624b\u5de5\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u8f74\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowCalib\u80fd\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowCalib\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4bLiDAR\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5230\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state. Then, a lightweight, offline-trained Q-function reranks these candidates, and the agent executes the action with the highest estimated value. The main contribution is to apply the Q-function directly during inference for immediate policy improvement, and not offline to relabel data for policy retraining. We demonstrate on the academic WebVoyager benchmark that our method significantly boosts agent success rates, improving a Qwen2.5-VL-7B agent from 38.8% to 55.7% and a proprietary GPT-4.1 agent from 82.4% to 88.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u7b56\u7565\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3VLM\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e76\u7528Q\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u6392\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u9875\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u4fdd\u6301VLM\u7b56\u7565\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Q\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u6392\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ef7\u503c\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728WebVoyager\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQwen2.5-VL-7B\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece38.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f355.7%\uff0cGPT-4.1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ece82.4%\u63d0\u5347\u81f388.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026VLM\u7684\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Q\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u91cd\u6392\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMinPRO\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bLLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u76ee\u6807\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51faMinimum Prefix Ratio\uff08MinPRO\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMinPRO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMinPRO\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9aLLM\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cMinPRO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics.

To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks.

This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure).

While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information.

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters).

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "MobileGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMobileGen\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "MobileGen\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "MobileGen\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd1.57\u500d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MobileGen\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0eGUI\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5728\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective.

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "PBO\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316SNNs\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u901a\u5e26\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SNNs\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bca\u65ad\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6807\u51c6\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u57df\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u9891\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPass-Bands Optimizer (PBO)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCF101\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "PBO\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316SNNs\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u901a\u5e26\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eSNN\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8d8b\u5411\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528BabyAI\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7531\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\u5851\u9020\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLaMA\u3001Qwen\u3001DeepSeek\u3001BERT\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CLIP\u3001BLIP\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cBLIP\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08precision@15: 0.70-0.73\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u4e0eCLIP\u548cBERT\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5e76\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation.

Yet, scaling up RL is bottlenecked by limited existing verifiable data, where improvements increasingly saturate over prolonged training. To overcome this, we propose Golden Goose, a simple trick to synthesize unlimited RLVR tasks from unverifiable internet text by constructing a multiple-choice question-answering version of the fill-in-the-middle task. Given a source text, we prompt an LLM to identify and mask key reasoning steps, then generate a set of diverse, plausible distractors. This enables us to leverage reasoning-rich unverifiable corpora typically excluded from prior RLVR data construction (e.g., science textbooks) to synthesize GooseReason-0.7M, a large-scale RLVR dataset with over 0.7 million tasks spanning mathematics, programming, and general scientific domains. Empirically, GooseReason effectively revives models saturated on existing RLVR data, yielding robust, sustained gains under continuous RL and achieving new state-of-the-art results for 1.5B and 4B-Instruct models across 15 diverse benchmarks. Finally, we deploy Golden Goose in a real-world setting, synthesizing RLVR tasks from raw FineWeb scrapes for the cybersecurity domain, where no prior RLVR data exists. Training Qwen3-4B-Instruct on the resulting data GooseReason-Cyber sets a new state-of-the-art in cybersecurity, surpassing a 7B domain-specialized model with extensive domain-specific pre-training and post-training.

However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\u03c3^2\u03b3^{-2}\\log(Nd/\u03b4)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters.

Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints.

On Hallucination Evaluation in Full Research Trajectory", "comment": null, "summary": "Diagnosing the failure mechanisms of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) remains a critical challenge. Existing benchmarks predominantly rely on end-to-end evaluation, obscuring critical intermediate hallucinations, such as flawed planning, that accumulate throughout the research trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose a shift from outcome-based to process-aware evaluation by auditing the full research trajectory. We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability. Furthermore, our diagnostic analysis traces the etiology of these failures to systemic deficits, specifically hallucination propagation and cognitive biases, providing foundational insights to guide future architectural optimization.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose AutoTraj, a two-stage framework that automatically learns TIR by repairing and rewarding tool-use trajectories. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, AutoTraj generates multiple candidate tool-use trajectories for each query and evaluates them along multiple dimensions. High-quality trajectories are directly retained, while low-quality ones are repaired using a LLM (i.e., LLM-as-Repairer). The resulting repaired and high-quality trajectories form a synthetic SFT dataset, while each repaired trajectory paired with its original low-quality counterpart constitutes a dataset for trajectory preference modeling. In the reinforcement learning (RL) stage, based on the preference dataset, we train a trajectory-level reward model to assess the quality of reasoning paths and combine it with outcome and format rewards, thereby explicitly guiding the optimization toward reliable TIR behaviors.

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT.

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal.

Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Lingua-SafetyBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001VLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8VLLMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4f46\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f46\u5355\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Lingua-SafetyBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b100,440\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u572810\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8611\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLLM\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u3002Qwen\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7248\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86ASR\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u4e0b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving.

StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute.

Our evaluation of 23 leading models reveals critical limitations: even top performers like Claude Opus 4.5 exhibit substantial gaps, including difficulty selecting appropriate calculators for end-to-end workflows given fuzzy queries, poor performance in iterative SQL-based database interactions, and marked reluctance to leverage external tools for numerical computation.

CoT is also a powerful tool for monitoring the behaviours of these agents: when faithful, they offer interpretations of the model's decision making process, and an early warning sign for dangerous behaviours. However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores.

We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm.

Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift.

A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images. By leveraging these distinct features to construct a binary classifier, DCCT achieves state-of-the-art generalization and robustness, significantly outperforming prior methods across over 20 unseen generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCCT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u6210\u50cf\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff09\u6765\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u989c\u8272\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DCCT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62dfCFA\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5355\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5269\u4f59\u4e24\u901a\u9053\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763U-Net\u5efa\u6a21\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "DCCT\u5728\u8d85\u8fc720\u79cd\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DCCT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u6210\u50cf\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation.

For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains.

Robust MDPs (RMDPs) extend this framework by allowing uncertainty in transition probabilities and optimizing against the worst-case realization of that uncertainty. In particular, $(s, a)$-rectangular RMDPs with $L_\\infty$ uncertainty sets form a fundamental and expressive model: they subsume classical MDPs and turn-based stochastic games. We consider this model with discounted payoffs. The existence of polynomial and strongly-polynomial time algorithms is a fundamental problem for these optimization models. For MDPs, linear programming yields polynomial-time algorithms for any arbitrary discount factor, and the seminal work of Ye established strongly--polynomial time for a fixed discount factor. The generalization of such results to RMDPs has remained an important open problem.

Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics. Then, a semantic controlling module is designed to take the garment image, tailored posture image, and semantic description as input to maintain garment details while simultaneously editing model postures, expressions, and various attributes.

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the Deterministic Sequencing of Exploration and Exploitation (DSEE), a multi-armed bandit algorithm, to address the need for accurate and real-time estimation of link delivery probabilities. This approach augments the reliability and resilience of the Shortest Anypath routing in the face of fluctuating link conditions. By coupling DSEE with Anypath routing, this algorithm continuously learns and ensures accurate delivery probability estimation and selects the most suitable way to efficiently route packets while maintaining a provable near-logarithmic regret bound.

However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS.

Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection.

This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision.

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting.

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches.

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence.

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1", "AI": {"tldr": "SLImE\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5373\u53ef\u6cc4\u9732\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SLImE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u548c\u73b0\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GEMINI\u3001COHERE\u3001NOMIC\u3001CLIP\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SLImE\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u591a\u6837\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5373\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u7559\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

These approaches require representative datasets for effective model training. However, while non-defective components are frequent, defective parts are rare in production, resulting in highly imbalanced datasets that adversely impact model performance. Existing strategies to address this challenge, such as specialized loss functions or traditional data augmentation techniques, have limitations, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning or the alteration of only simple image features. Therefore, this work explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) as an alternative method for expanding limited datasets and enhancing supervised machine learning performance. Specifically, we investigate Stable Diffusion and CycleGAN as image generation models, focusing on the segmentation of combine harvester components in thermal images for subsequent defect detection.

Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels.

Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%.

In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts.

However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

This failure to ground outputs in objective geometric constraints leads to plausible yet factually incorrect hallucinations, rooted in training paradigms that prioritize linguistic fluency over geometric fidelity. This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that \"cures\" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection.

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "RN-DPO\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5bb3\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6760\u6746\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0cRN-DPO\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6DPO\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RN-DPO\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6709\u5bb3\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u50cf\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6DPO\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes.

Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges.

We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \\textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding.

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "TaTa\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u6717\u8ddd\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "TaTa\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u6717\u8ddd\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec6\u5316\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTaTa\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TaTa\u901a\u8fc7\u5e03\u6717\u8ddd\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence.
