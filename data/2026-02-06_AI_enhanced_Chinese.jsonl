An important challenge in the field is scaling cellular resolution models to real-scale tumor simulations, which is critical for the development of digital twin models of diseases and requires the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) since every time step involves trillions of operations. We hereby present a scalable HPC solution for the molecular diffusion modeling using an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method (FVM) frameworks. The paper systematically evaluates a novel scalable Biological Finite Volume Method (BioFVM) library and presents an extensive performance analysis of the available solutions.

The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives.

Autoscaling serves as the primary control mechanism for balancing resource utilization and quality of service, yet existing policies are either opaque learned models that require substantial per-deployment training or brittle hand-tuned rules that fail to generalize. We investigate whether large language models can act as universal few-shot resource allocators that adapt across rapidly evolving microservice deployments.\n  We propose ORACL, Optimized Reasoning for Autoscaling via Chain of Thought with LLMs for Microservices, a framework that leverages prior knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning to diagnose performance regressions and recommend resource allocations. ORACL transforms runtime telemetry, including pods, replicas, CPU and memory usage, latency, service-level objectives, and fault signals, into semantic natural-language state descriptions and invokes an LLM to produce an interpretable intermediate reasoning trace. This reasoning identifies likely root causes, prunes the action space, and issues safe allocation decisions under policy constraints.

Recently, distributed append-only logs are opting for a layered approach, combining crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus with hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for greater resiliency. Unfortunately, hardware TEEs can be subject to (rare) attacks, undermining the very guarantees that distributed ledgers are carefully designed to achieve. In response, we present Proteus, a new distributed consensus protocol that cautiously trusts the guarantees of TEEs.

However, deploying adaptive controllers to implement such dynamic scaling in operational networks is challenging due to the risk of breaching service agreements and operational constraints. To mitigate this challenge, we present a novel method for learning the safe operating region of the RAN, i.e., the set of resource allocations and network configurations for which its specification is fulfilled. The method, which we call (C)ausal (O)nline (L)earning, operates in two online phases: an inference phase and an intervention phase. In the first phase, we passively observe the RAN to infer an initial safe region via causal inference and Gaussian process regression. In the second phase, we gradually expand this region through interventional Bayesian learning. We prove that COL ensures that the learned region is safe with a specified probability and that it converges to the full safe region under standard conditions. We experimentally validate COL on a 5G testbed. The results show that COL quickly learns the safe region while incurring low operational cost and being up to 10x more sample-efficient than current state-of-the-art methods for safe learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "COL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u6269\u5c55RAN\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u57285G\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5bb9\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8fdd\u53cd\u670d\u52a1\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002COL\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60RAN\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "COL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u5bdfRAN\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u521d\u59cb\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u5e72\u9884\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCOL\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad810\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "COL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60RAN\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cCOL\u57285G\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e8a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a principled analysis of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), showing that RoPE naturally decomposes into frequency components with distinct positional sensitivities. We demonstrate that this frequency structure explains why shared-attention mechanisms, where a target image is generated while attending to tokens from a reference image, can lead to reference copying, in which the model reproduces content from the reference instead of extracting only its stylistic cues. Our analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of RoPE dominate the attention computation, forcing queries to attend mainly to spatially aligned reference tokens and thereby inducing this unintended copying behavior. Building on these insights, we introduce a method for selectively modulating RoPE frequency bands so that attention reflects semantic similarity rather than strict positional alignment. Applied to modern transformer-based diffusion architectures, where all tokens share attention, this modulation restores stable and meaningful shared attention. As a result, it enables effective control over the degree of style transfer versus content copying, yielding a proper style-aligned generation process in which stylistic attributes are transferred without duplicating reference content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86RoPE\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5171\u4eab\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3RoPE\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86Rotary Positional Embeddings\uff08RoPE\uff09\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u5236RoPE\u9891\u7387\u5e26\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8c03\u5236\u540e\u7684RoPE\u4f7f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u5236RoPE\u9891\u7387\u5e26\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u6269\u6563\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u5236\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

However, the correctness of code generated by LLMs remains a concern. A potential remedy to this concern is to have LLMs generate formal correctness proofs along with such code. However, compared with code generation, code-proof generation requires much higher reasoning capability and has much less existing data to learn from. In this paper, we present VeruSyn, a data synthesis pipeline for Verus, a state-of-the-art verification tool for system software written in Rust. Through self-synthesis and tutorial-based synthesis, VeruSyn achieves much larger scale and Verus-feature coverage than previous data-synthesis techniques designed for Verus; VeruSyn also supplements its dataset with long-chain-of-thought (CoT) data through agent trajectory synthesis. With VeruSyn, we synthesize the largest set of Verus verified programs: 6.9 million Rust programs, each with a formal specification and a proof that it meets that specification. This dataset lets us create a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model with appealing cost-proof tradeoff compared with state-of-the-art commercial models like Claude Sonnet 4.5.

SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided.

AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks.

But what exactly does this quadratic cost pay for? Even the minimal requirement that every correct processor \\emph{receive at least one message} already necessitates $\u03a9(f^2 + n)$ messages. This raises a fundamental question: is the Dolev-Reischuk bound about the difficulty of \\emph{reaching univalency} -- the point at which the protocol's outcome is determined -- or merely about \\emph{disseminating} the outcome to all processors afterward?\n  We resolve this question by showing that reaching univalency does \\emph{not} require quadratic communication. Specifically, we introduce $\u03b5$-BA, a relaxation allowing an $\u03b5$-fraction of correct processors to output incorrectly, and prove it can be solved deterministically with $O(n \\log n)$ communication complexity when $f < n(1/3 - \u03b5)$. Crucially, any $\u03b5$-BA protocol can serve as the first phase of a full BA protocol: after $\u03b5$-BA, a single all-to-all exchange and majority vote completes BA. Since the outcome is already determined after $\u03b5$-BA, this demonstrates that the quadratic cost in Dolev-Reischuk stems entirely from dissemination, rather than from reaching univalency.

However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices. This enables physically interpretable human motion sensing, including gait-induced range variation and respiration-induced sub-wavelength displacement, as well as the extraction of target-induced dynamics up to 20 dB weaker than dominant static multipath components.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoSRef\u65b9\u6848\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u540c\u6b65Wi-Fi\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u96f7\u8fbe\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u540c\u6b65Wi-Fi\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u96f7\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edfWi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u4e0eWi-Fi\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdOTA LoS-path\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6848\uff08LoSRef\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba4\u5185\u4eba\u4f53\u6b65\u6001\u548c\u547c\u5438\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7528Wi-Fi\u8bbe\u5907\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u4fe1\u9053\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "LoSRef\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u975e\u540c\u6b65Wi-Fi\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u76f8\u5e72\u7684\u53cc\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Wi-Fi\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, several remaining issues hamper their widespread use. One of the advantages of classic voxel grids is the ease of constructing hierarchical representations by either storing volumetric mipmaps or selectively pruning branches of an already hierarchical voxel grid. Such strategies reduce rendering time and eliminate aliasing when lower levels of detail are required. Constructing similar strategies for Gaussian-based volumes is not trivial. Straightforward solutions, such as prefiltering or computing mipmap-style representations, lead to increased memory requirements or expensive re-fitting of each level separately. Additionally, such solutions do not guarantee a smooth transition between different hierarchy levels. To address these limitations, we propose Gabor Fields, an orientation-selective mixture of Gabor kernels that enables continuous frequency filtering at no cost. The frequency content of the asset is reduced by selectively pruning primitives, directly benefiting rendering performance. Beyond filtering, we demonstrate that stochastically sampling from different frequencies and orientations at each ray recursion enables masking substantial portions of the volume, accelerating ray traversal time in single- and multiple-scattering settings.

Building on prior work that considers single-package delivery across networks using multiple types of collaborative agents with restricted movement areas (e.g., drones or trucks), we examine the complexity of the problem under structural and operational constraints. Our focus is on minimizing total delivery time by coordinating agents that differ in speed and movement range across a graph. This problem formulation aligns with the recently proposed Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT), introduced by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022].\n  We first resolve an open question posed by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022] by showing that even when the delivery network is a path graph, DDT admits no polynomial-time approximation within any polynomially encodable factor $a(n)$, unless P=NP. Additionally, we identify the intersection graph of the agents, where nodes represent agents and edges indicate an overlap of the movement areas of two agents, as an important structural concept.

Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task.

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering.

We develop a verification framework that integrates stochastic timed hybrid automata with statistical model checking (SMC) with confidence bounds to formally assess CSMA/CA parameterizations under grid workloads.

We introduce a split-kernel scheme that decouples fluid updates from solid boundary handling, substantially reducing warp divergence and improving utilization on GPUs. We further perform the first von Neumann stability analysis of the high-order moment-encoded LBM (HOME-LBM) formulation, characterizing its spectral behavior and deriving stability bounds for individual moment components. These theoretical insights directly guide a practical 16-bit moment quantization without compromising numerical stability. Our framework achieves up to 6x speedup and reduces GPU memory footprint by up to 50% in fluid-only scenarios and 25% in scenes with complex solid boundaries compared to the state-of-the-art LBM solver, while preserving physical fidelity across a range of large-scale benchmarks and real-time demonstrations.

It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels.

Project website: https://vista-vla.github.io/", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "MINT optimizes AI-human planning by actively filling knowledge gaps via strategic queries, achieving near-expert performance with minimal input.", "motivation": "Addressing the challenge of incomplete information and unknowns in joint human-AI planning by actively eliciting human inputs.", "method": "Proposes Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about knowledge gaps and optimize AI elicitation strategies through self-play and LLM-assisted query curation.", "result": "MINT attains near-expert returns with limited questions, showing improved rewards and success rates across benchmarks.", "conclusion": "MINT-based planning achieves near-expert performance with minimal human input, significantly improving rewards and success rates."}}

DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\\sf{col}(v) \\in C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_t\\}, t\\leq n$. A set $R = \\{r_1, \\dots, r_k\\}$ of $k \\leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\\mathsf{col}(r_i) \\in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.\n  Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION.

While generating raster images from 3D geometry via Monte Carlo raytracing is commonplace, there is no corresponding practical approach for robustly and directly extracting editable vector images with shading information from 3D geometry. To fill this gap, we formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem over the space of geometries and colors of diffusion curve handles, and solve it with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. At the core of our method is a novel differential boundary element method (BEM) framework that reconstructs colors from diffusion curve handles and computes gradients with respect to their parameters, requiring the expensive matrix factorization only once at the beginning of the optimization. Unlike triangulation-based techniques that require a clean domain decomposition, our method is robust to geometrically challenging scenarios, such as intersecting diffusion curves, and to color noise in the target image, enabling the direct use of noisy Monte Carlo samples without requiring a converged, error-free input image.

In this paper, we study fair $k$-center with outliers, where centers must respect group-based representation constraints while up to $z$ points may be discarded.\n  While a bi-criteria FPT approximation was previously known, no true approximation algorithm was available for this problem. We present the first deterministic $3$-approximation algorithm running in fixed-parameter tractable time parameterized by $k$. Our approach departs from projection-based methods and instead directly constructs a fair solution using a novel iterative ball-finding framework, based on a structural trichotomy that enables fixed-parameter approximation for the problem.\n  We further extend our algorithm to fair $k$-supplier with outliers and to the more general fair-range setting with both lower and upper bounds.

The two strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but developing a unified approach to take advantage of both methods has proved challenging. A key challenge faced by optimization approaches is the complicated nonlinear relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector pose. When this must be handled concurrently with additional nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance, optimization IK algorithms may suffer high failure rates. We present a new formulation for optimization IK that uses an analytic IK solution as a change of variables, and is fundamentally easier for optimizers to solve.

Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching.

An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow.

Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines.

This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9ML\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\u548cML\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c5e\u6027\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u8fdb\u5c55\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591aML\u539f\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ecd\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6216\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c6\u89d2\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5236\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8c03\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u9700\u6c42\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5171\u540c\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u884d\u751f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u96c6\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups.

Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeVStereo\u901a\u8fc7NeRF\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NVS-\u7acb\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u76843D\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u62cd\u6444\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "NeVStereo\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u7684NVS\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001NeRF\u8026\u5408\u7684\u675f\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11NeRF\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u3001\u5ba4\u5916\u3001\u684c\u9762\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeVStereo\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e36%\uff0c\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710.4%\uff0cNVS\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad84.5%\uff0c\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff08F1 91.93%\uff0cChamfer 4.35 mm\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NeVStereo\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86NeRF\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NVS\u4e0e\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8f93\u51fa\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001NVS\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this context, projects would benefit from automated solutions to support the migration process. In this paper, we propose TestMigrationsInPy, a dataset of test migrations from unittest to pytest.

Future research proposing novel solutions to migrate frameworks in Python can rely on TestMigrationsInPy as a ground truth.

Classical boustrophedon lawnmower surveys provide geometric coverage guarantees but can waste effort by oversampling predictable regions. In contrast, informative path planning (IPP) methods leverage spatial correlations to reduce oversampling, yet typically offer no guarantees on reconstruction quality. This paper bridges these approaches by addressing informative path planning with guaranteed estimation uncertainty: computing the shortest path whose measurements ensure that the Gaussian-process (GP) posterior variance -- an intrinsic uncertainty measure that lower-bounds the mean-squared prediction error under the GP model -- falls below a user-specified threshold over the monitoring region.\n  We propose a three-stage approach: (i) learn a GP model from available prior information; (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps for each candidate sensing location, indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below a specified target; and (iii) plan a near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies the global uncertainty constraint. To address heterogeneous phenomena, we incorporate a nonstationary kernel that captures spatially varying correlation structure, and we accommodate non-convex environments with obstacles. Algorithmically, we present methods with provable approximation guarantees for sensing-location selection and for the joint selection-and-routing problem under a travel budget.

Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts.

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.\n  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.\n  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u788e\u7247\u4e3b\u52a8\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u788e\u7247\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5728\u8f68\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c0f\u578b\u536b\u661f\u56e0\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u800c\u9010\u6e10\u88ab\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5173\u952e\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u71c3\u6599\u6548\u7387\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u78b0\u649e\u533a\u57df\u907f\u514d\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u4e8eIridium 33\u788e\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8f68\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u52a0\u6cb9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u822a\u5929\u5668\u4ea4\u4f1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u7684MR\u5206\u5a29\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8eVR\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u53d7\u5b66\u5458\u6b22\u8fce\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6e\u8f6c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u4e0d\u60c5\u613f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5a29\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u533b\u5b66\u751f\u83b7\u5f97\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u5a29\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u5458\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684MR\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u5916\u90e8RGB-D\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5546\u7528\u5934\u6234\u5f0f\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff08HMDs\uff09\u7684\u7a7f\u900f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u6574\u5408\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7531\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u5bf9\u9f50\u6bcd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6807\u8bb0\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5206\u5a29\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u8be5\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6ce8\u518c\u9884\u5148\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u513f\u5934\u90e8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u5934\u663e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cMR\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5206\u5a29\u3001\u4ea7\u540e\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8eVR\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u53d7\u5b66\u5458\u9752\u7750\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08MR\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5206\u5a29\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u5458\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u5176\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u865a\u62df\u6307\u5bfc\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5b66\u5458\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002"}}

We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognized, one may specify a hash function more tailored to some assumed key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case this assumption does not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance, as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys \\emph{and} faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API. The experiments show that the adaptive approach marries the common-case performance of weak hash functions with the robustness of general-purpose ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u952e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868API\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u5f31\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Ideally, good test suites should test both normal and exceptional behaviors to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. While current research analyzes exceptions that propagate to tests, it does not explore other exceptions that do not reach the tests. In this paper, we provide an empirical study to explore how frequently exceptional behaviors are tested in real-world systems. We consider both exceptions that propagate to tests and the ones that do not reach the tests. For this purpose, we run an instrumented version of test suites, monitor their execution, and collect information about the exceptions raised at runtime. We analyze the test suites of 25 Python systems, covering 5,372 executed methods, 17.9M calls, and 1.4M raised exceptions. We find that 21.4% of the executed methods do raise exceptions at runtime. In methods that raise exceptions, on the median, 1 in 10 calls exercise exceptional behaviors. Close to 80% of the methods that raise exceptions do so infrequently, but about 20% raise exceptions more frequently. Finally, we provide implications for researchers and practitioners. We suggest developing novel tools to support exercising exceptional behaviors and refactoring expensive try/except blocks. We also call attention to the fact that exception-raising behaviors are not necessarily \"abnormal\" or rare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Python\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b021.4%\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u88ab\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u672a\u5230\u8fbe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4eea\u5668\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u76d1\u63a7\u6267\u884c\u5e76\u6536\u96c6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e8625\u4e2aPython\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "21.4%\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f15\u53d1\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7ea620%\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9891\u7e41\u5f15\u53d1\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u6602\u8d35\u7684try/except\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u2018\u5f02\u5e38\u2019\u6216\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u3002"}}

Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic.

Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "EgoPoseVR \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684 VR \u5168\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 HMD \u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c RGB-D \u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e VR \u5934\u6234\u5f0f\u663e\u793a\u5668\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e0b\u534a\u8eab\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "EgoPoseVR \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7ba1\u9053\u5c06\u5934\u6234\u5f0f\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff08HMD\uff09\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684 RGB-D \u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u65f6\u7a7a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5e27\u7ea7\u548c\u5173\u8282\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u65bd\u52a0 HMD \u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEgoPoseVR \u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cEgoPoseVR \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4f53\u73b0\u611f\u548c\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u7528\u610f\u613f\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoPoseVR \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u623f\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684 VR \u5168\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002"}}

We investigate how the discrete geometry of grids interacts with capacity depletion by analyzing two natural baselines and one capacity-aware heuristic. First, we give explicit adversarial sequences on grid instances showing that purely local rules can be forced into large competitive ratios: (i) a capacity-sensitive weighted-Voronoi heuristic (\\textsc{CS-Voronoi}) can suffer cascading \\emph{region-collapse} effects when nearby capacity is exhausted; and (ii) nearest-available \\textsc{Greedy} (with randomized tie-breaking) can be driven into repeated long reassignments via an \\emph{oscillation} construction. These results formalize geometric failure modes that are specific to discrete $L_1$ metrics with hard capacities. Motivated by these lower bounds, we then discuss a semi-online extension in which the algorithm may delay assignment for up to $\u03c4$ time steps and solve each batch optimally via a min-cost flow computation.

While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components.

This paper presents a minimal-sensing strategy that enables a free-swimming underwater robot to center itself and traverse a flooded pipe of known radius using only an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars: a downward-facing single-beam sonar and a rotating 360 degree sonar. We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal. The system requires no Doppler velocity log, external tracking, or complex multi-sensor arrays. Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations. These results show that reliable in-pipe navigation and inspection can be achieved with a lightweight, computationally efficient sensing and processing architecture, advancing the practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6781\u7b80\u4f20\u611f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ec5\u7528IMU\u3001\u538b\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u58f0\u7eb3\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u6df9\u6ca1\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5c45\u4e2d\u5e76\u7a7f\u8d8a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u68c0\u67e5\u56e0\u53d7\u9650\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6d51\u6d4a\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ebf\u7d22\u7a00\u7f3a\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u901f\u5ea6\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6216\u590d\u6742\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528IMU\u3001\u538b\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u58f0\u7eb3\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u5411\u4e0b\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5355\u6ce2\u675f\u58f0\u7eb3\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c360\u5ea6\u58f0\u7eb3\uff09\u7684\u6781\u7b80\u4f20\u611f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6ce2\u675f\u58f0\u7eb3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u58f0\u7eb3\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684PD\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df9\u6ca1\u768446\u5398\u7c73\u76f4\u5f84\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528BlueROV2\u91cd\u578b\u9065\u63a7\u8f66\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5c45\u4e2d\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u5168\u7a0b\u7a7f\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "AirGlove\u901a\u8fc7\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5957\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u624b\u5957\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u624b\u5957\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u624b\u5957\u624b\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u624b\u5957\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AirGlove\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5957\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u624b\u5957\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u5957\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAirGlove\u5728\u591a\u6b3e\u4f20\u611f\u624b\u5957\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u4e86\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "AirGlove\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5957\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u65b0\u624b\u5957\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdADR\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540d\u4e49PPO\u5728\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316PPO\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0cMCTS\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u7ed3\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u672a\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\uff08ADR\uff09\u4e2d\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u71c3\u6599\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u540d\u4e49Masked PPO\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316Masked PPO\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u666e\u901a\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f68\u9053\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u6cb9\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u788e\u7247\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u540d\u4e49PPO\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316PPO\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e14\u540d\u4e49\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u9002\u4e2d\uff1bMCTS\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u6700\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u51fa\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5f39\u6027ADR\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapeUP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u8c03\u548c\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0cShapeUP\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ShapeUP\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u6e903D\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u76842D\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "ShapeUP\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76843D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u5efa\u8303\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapeUP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u76843D\u5185\u5bb9\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62.

Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u652f\u4ed8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u533f\u540d\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u652f\u4ed8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e94\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u5206\u8868\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5171\u8bc6\u504f\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5faa\u73af\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d1f\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u663e\u793a\u6b63\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1125.8%\u3002LLM\u8bc4\u5206\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u8bc60.46\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u652f\u4ed8\u98ce\u9669\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2dLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u504f\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "InterPrior\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u8c03\u6280\u80fd\u5230\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u8c03\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "InterPrior\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u5168\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u4eff\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "InterPrior\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "InterPrior\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\uff0cC++\u548cRust\u68c0\u6d4b\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\uff0cRust\u548cPython\u6f0f\u6d1e\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff0cGo\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u591a\uff0cPython\u8865\u4e01\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u6162\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u662f\u5426\u56e0\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea559\u4e2aOSS-Fuzz\u9879\u76ee\u768461,444\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9519\u8bef\u548c999,248\u4e2a\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u6309\u4e3b\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) C++\u548cRust\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c(ii) Rust\u548cPython\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f4e\u4f46\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u66b4\u9732\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c(iii) \u5d29\u6e83\u7c7b\u578b\u56e0\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u5f02\uff0cGo\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\u800cRust\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c(iv) Python\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u4f46\u68c0\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring.

Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features.\n  In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances. We empirically demonstrate that generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs such as $\u03c0_{0.5}$ and GR00T-N1.6. To encourage the research community to evaluate their own VLAs on BusyBox and to propose new affordance generalization experiments, we have designed BusyBox to be easy to build in most robotics labs.

Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \\textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \\emph{semantic vagueness}, \\emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \\emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \\emph{unresolved confusion} and \\emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\\approx$0.80).

They interfere with automated quality assurance of code changes and hinder efficient software testing. Previous work evaluated approaches to train machine learning models to classify flaky tests based on identifiers in the test code. However, the resulting classifiers have been shown to lack generalizability, hindering their applicability in practical environments. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to generalize across various tasks. Thus, they represent a promising approach to address the generalizability problem of previous approaches. In this study, we evaluated three LLMs (two general-purpose models, one code-specific model) using three prompting techniques on two benchmark datasets from prior studies on flaky test classification. Furthermore, we manually investigated 50 samples from the given datasets to determine whether classifying flaky tests based only on test code is feasible for humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to classify flaky tests given only the test code. The results of our best prompt-model combination were only marginally better than random guessing. In our manual analysis, we found that the test code does not necessarily contain sufficient information for a flakiness classification.

We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \\modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\\times$ to $65\\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b \\modelname\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6781\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210-\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff08\\modelname\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08EBMs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u5207\u7247\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u5e27\u91cd\u6392\uff09\u6765\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u8868\u9762\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\\modelname \u5728 GenAI-Bench \u548c MonteBench \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700 30K \u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709 VLM \u65b9\u6cd5\u5c11 6 \u81f3 65 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\\modelname \u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TaSA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u6211\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7a81\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a5\u89e6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u5728\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u81ea\u6211\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u63a5\u89e6\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u63a5\u89e6/\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7269\u4f53/\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u635f\u574f\u3002", "method": "TaSA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u6211\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a81\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61\u63a5\u89e6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u94c5\u7b14\u82af\u63d2\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u94c5\u7b14\u3001\u786c\u5e01\u63d2\u5165\u69fd\u3001\u56de\u5f62\u9488\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u7eb8\u4e0a\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cTaSA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TaSA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u611f\u5b98\u8870\u51cf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules.

However, existing pointwise benchmarks have limited ability to shed light on the robustness and generalisation abilities of agents across alternative versions of the source code. We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families.

Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss.

Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).", "AI": {"tldr": "MPA\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6e90\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6e10\u8fdb\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6df7\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cc\u94fe\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "MPA\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff08+7.0%\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MPA\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate.

By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring.

These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \\emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\\%, 11.25\\%, and 9.55\\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u8282\u80fd\uff08\u6700\u9ad889%\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eedAI\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5bf9\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e866\u4e2a6B-7B\u548c4\u4e2a3B-4B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6HumanEval\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6LongBench\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5355\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u8017\uff08\u589e\u5e451.3%-51.8%\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff0910\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67093\u4e2a\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u8f93\u51fa\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b044%-89%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u586b\u5145\u6210\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u800c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u8017\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u8f93\u51fa\uff08babbling\uff09\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe89%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u8017\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u9884\u586b\u5145\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach.

This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions.

The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the \\textit{Tactical Loop} for code-level refinement, while the \\textit{Strategic Loop} for attack strategy replanning.

A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TEA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTEA\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08TEA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92-\u8fdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cTEA\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e8687,876\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u6db5\u76d6\u65e5\u5e38\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u4ea4\u4e92\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u4f4d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u548c3D\u4ea4\u4e92\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002"}}

Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost.

We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use.

To appear in the conference proceedings", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold.

Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity.

We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots.

Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u539f\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive \"Generic Filters\" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the \"Autoregressive Blindness Bound,\" a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors.

However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests.

Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths.

All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6db2\u538b\u88c5\u8f7d\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u5728\u5e9f\u7269\u5bb9\u5668\u56de\u6536\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e9f\u7269\u5bb9\u5668\u56de\u6536\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u9636\u6bb5\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6446\u52a8\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u5bfc\u7eb3\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6446\u9524\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6446\u52a8\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\u4e0ePPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u507f\u672a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u9886\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff08\u5982\u8f7d\u8377\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u6267\u884c\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u5173\u8282\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u632f\u8361\u6291\u5236\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u540d\u4e49\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6db2\u538b\u88c5\u8f7d\u8d77\u91cd\u673a\u6267\u884c\u5e9f\u7269\u5bb9\u5668\u56de\u6536\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u540d\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u632f\u8361\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation.

Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts.

In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks.

We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth.

While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors.

However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.", "AI": {"tldr": "RaBiT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u6b8b\u5dee\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53472\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u6781\u7aef\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u65e0\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u75c5\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRaBiT\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u987a\u5e8f\u5bfc\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u7ea0\u6b63\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RaBiT\u57282\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5ab2\u7f8e\u786c\u4ef6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08VQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.49\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "RaBiT\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u6b8b\u5dee\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e862\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RTX 4090\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.49\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "APEX\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728Static Homogeneity Assumption\u548cLearning-Inference Disconnect\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "method": "APEX\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Prototype Manifold\uff08APM\uff09\u548cPosterior-Aware OOD Scoring\uff08PAOS\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u89e3\u51b3Static Homogeneity Assumption\u548cLearning-Inference Disconnect\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAPEX\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "APEX\u901a\u8fc7Two-Stage Repair\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively.

However, their reasoning process often remains a \"fast thinking\" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, \"slow thinking\" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations.

Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory.

We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework.

We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality.

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively.

However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task.

Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAIL\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u81ea\u6211\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u540d\u504f\u597d\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SAIL\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u97006%\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SAIL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u589e\u5f3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training.

To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining.

To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "VRIQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793aVLMs\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8VLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6267\u884c\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5f31\u70b9\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165VRIQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u8c1c\u9898\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bca\u65ad\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u6790\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u62bd\u8c61\u8c1c\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea628%\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u4efb\u52a145%\u300256%\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\uff0c43%\u6e90\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ec51%\u6e90\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002VRIQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark.

Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP).

While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa SparseVideoNav \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa SparseVideoNav \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "SparseVideoNav \u5728 BVN \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709 LLM \u57fa\u7ebf\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8 2.5 \u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347 27 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseVideoNav \u5728 BVN \u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ee7\u627f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u8f7d\u5927\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8f6e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5230\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u52a0\u8f7d\u539f\u59cb\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u6b21\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6b21\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed4\u500d\u3002\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ee7\u627f\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7ee7\u627f\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations.

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images.

Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification.

Existing datasets, often limited to light haze, rain, and snow, fail to capture extreme weather conditions. To address this gap, this study introduces the Traffic Surveillance Benchmark for Occluded vehicles under various Weather conditions (TSBOW), a comprehensive dataset designed to enhance occluded vehicle detection across diverse annual weather scenarios. Comprising over 32 hours of real-world traffic data from densely populated urban areas, TSBOW includes more than 48,000 manually annotated and 3.2 million semi-labeled frames; bounding boxes spanning eight traffic participant classes from large vehicles to micromobility devices and pedestrians. We establish an object detection benchmark for TSBOW, highlighting challenges posed by occlusions and adverse weather. With its varied road types, scales, and viewpoints, TSBOW serves as a critical resource for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent.

Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers.

Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states.

Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the \"divide and conquer\" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, \"Explicit Marking\" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a \"conflict set.\" Second, \"Implicit Disambiguation\" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDisco\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5bc6\u96c6\u7ec6\u80de\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e3a\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u672a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDisco\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u663e\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u6d88\u6b67\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u9690\u5f0f\u6d88\u6b67\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86GBC-FS 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\u7684\u8272\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u591a\u4e3a\u975e\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e14\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\uff09\u3002Disco\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Disco\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6807\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u80de\u90bb\u63a5\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec6\u80de\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors.

We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions.

Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains.

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining.

When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets.

By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration.

Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively.

Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faResin\u548cRCs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u5b9e\u65f6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Resin\uff08\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7535\u8def\uff08RCs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aResin\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u8bed\u4e49\u3002RCs\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002RCs\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f02\u6b65\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u5316\u9891\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ec5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d7\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.\n  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional \"anxiety\" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.\n  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt (\"bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem\"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.\n  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology.

However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u7ea6\u675fVision Transformers\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728Vision Transformers\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u9aa4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u5c55\u5f00\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e8c\u5143\u63a9\u7801\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u524d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7f6e\u96f6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u62a4\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f29\u653e\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4fdd\u7559\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86Vision Transformers\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios.

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%.

However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models.

However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA.

This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed.

However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches.

Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation.

While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward.

On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters.

Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "LeakBoost\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u635f\u5931\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u7684LeakBoost\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u5408\u6210\u63a2\u6d4b\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u6210\u5458\u4e0e\u975e\u6210\u5458\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "LeakBoost\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AUC\uff080.81-0.88\uff09\u548c\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LeakBoost\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5f02\u6b65VLA\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u591a\u7ea7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe126.67%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982RLinf\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u96c6\u5f02\u6b65\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8659.25%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u53ef\u8fbe126.67%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u5f02\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Vision-Language-Action\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe126.67%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise.

Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions.

Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction.

ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines.

In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA.

While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoGoSeg\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u6f0f\u68c0\u3002", "method": "LoGoSeg\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u6848\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08A-847\u3001PC-459\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cLoGoSeg\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGoSeg\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u6d41\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).\n  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.\n  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGOI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790SE(3)\u4e0a\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u653e\u5927\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5de5\u5177\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u77e9\u9635\u674e\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faSE(3)\u4e0a\u5de6\u5e73\u51e1\u5316M\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "GOI\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u91cf\u5316\u5355\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "GOI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6790\u3001Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u3002"}}

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings.

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies.

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI).

Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%.

We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy.

We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum.

Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROMAN\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6cd5\u89c4\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fdd\u89c4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fdd\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "ROMAN\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5efa\u6a21\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b49\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fdd\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "ROMAN\u5728CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fdd\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4ABLE\u9ad87.91%\uff0c\u6bd4LawBreaker\u9ad855.96%\uff0c\u4e14\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u4ea4\u901a\u6cd5\u89c4\u6761\u6b3e\u3002", "conclusion": "ROMAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6cd5\u89c4\u6743\u91cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u8fdd\u89c4\u573a\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177ABLE\u548cLawBreaker\u3002"}}

We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7be1\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u5728\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u7be1\u6539\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7be1\u6539\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7be1\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos.

Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AGFF-Embed\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408EGA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684CLIP\u548cMLLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AGFF-Embed\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u805a\u7126\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u6ed1\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408EGA\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6279\u91cf\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MMEB\u548cMMVP-VLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAGFF-Embed\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AGFF-Embed\u7ed3\u5408EGA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728MMEB\u548cMMVP-VLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections).

A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks.

In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Allocentric Perceiver \u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u66ff\u4ee3\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 VLMs \u5728 allocentric \u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728 egocentric \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a/\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cVision-Language Models (VLMs) \u7684 allocentric \u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cVLMs \u5728\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u7684 allocentric \u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5373\u7b54\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u800c\u975e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "Allocentric Perceiver \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ece\u4e00\u5f20\u6216\u591a\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u5ea6\u91cf3D\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6 allocentric \u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u793a\u9aa8\u5e72 VLM\uff0c\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u4ece\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "Allocentric Perceiver \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728 allocentric \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea610%\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 egocentric \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u6e90/\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Allocentric Perceiver \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728 allocentric \u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u7ea610%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684 egocentric \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u6e90/\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Project page: https://ui-mem.github.io", "summary": "Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors.

The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework.

Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model.

In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium.

However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning.

Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information.

Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective.

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU.

Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly.

However, existing video fusion methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and feature warping, resulting in severe computational overhead and limited scalability. This paper presents MambaVF, an efficient video fusion framework based on state space models (SSMs) that performs temporal modeling without explicit motion estimation. First, by reformulating video fusion as a sequential state update process, MambaVF captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity while significantly reducing computation and memory costs. Second, MambaVF proposes a lightweight SSM-based fusion module that replaces conventional flow-guided alignment via a spatio-temporal bidirectional scanning mechanism. This module enables efficient information aggregation across frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our MambaVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical video fusion tasks. We highlight that MambaVF enjoys high efficiency, reducing up to 92.25% of parameters and 88.79% of computational FLOPs and a 2.1x speedup compared to existing methods.

To resolve this, we propose \\textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency.

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective.

However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as \"visual thoughts\" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks.

While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20\u00b0 and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold.
