This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint.

A vibrant ecosystem of visualization tools exists, catering to a wide variety of different needs. Real-time visualizations of numerical simulations offer scientists immediate feedback about the status of their simulations and can also be valuable educational and outreach tools. Developing a visualization tool with support for different operating systems, CPU/GPU architectures, and programming languages can be a challenge. It is common to use one or more graphics or UI libraries to act as abstraction layers and hide the underlying complexity. Whereas external libraries greatly simplify the initial programming effort, we argue that relying on them introduces new dependencies and problems, such as a higher entry barriers for new developers and users, and uncertainty regarding long-term support. In this paper we present a new approach for real time visualizations which we have implemented for the N-body package REBOUND. We propose to use a web browser to handle GPU accelerated rendering. This enables us to offer 3D, interactive visualizations on all major operating systems. What makes our new approach unique is that we achieve this without the need for any external libraries. We utilize WebAssembly to reuse existing OpenGL visualization code. Using communication via HTTP and a custom built-in web server, we are able to provide both local and remote real time visualizations. In addition to the browser based real time visualization, our approach offers other additional operating modes, including simulations running entirely within the browser, visualizations within jupyter notebooks, and traditional standalone visualizations using OpenGL. We focus on the implementation in REBOUND but the concepts and ideas discussed can be applied to many other areas in need of scientific and non-scientific real time visualizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7WebAssembly\u548c\u5185\u7f6eWeb\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e73\u53f03D\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5e93\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4e14\u957f\u671f\u652f\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528WebAssembly\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684OpenGL\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HTTP\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5185\u7f6eWeb\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u672c\u5730\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u76843D\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \\textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \\textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \\emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations.

The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads.

Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64.

Project Page: https://humansensinglab.github.io/super-head/", "summary": "Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuperHead\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e53D\u53cd\u6f14\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u5934\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u52a8\u753b\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u6e90\u5bfc\u81f4\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u52a8\u753b3D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u63013D\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76843D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e53D\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6848\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u5934\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5934\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982FLAME\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u753b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSuperHead\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9762\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SuperHead\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e53D\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, extracting exact and complete information using range queries is costly. As a remedy, some previous work proposed a faster principle, {\\em approximate} search with range queries, also called single range cover (SRC) search. It can, however, produce some false positives. In this work we introduce a new SRC search structure, a $c$-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which provably decreases the average number of false positives by logarithmic factor while keeping asymptotically same time and memory complexities as a classic tree structure. A $c$-DAG is a tunable augmentation of the 1D-Tree with denser overlapping branches ($c \\geq 3$ children per node). We perform a competitive analysis of a $c$-DAG with respect to 1D-Tree and derive an additive constant time overhead and a multiplicative logarithmic improvement of the false positives ratio, on average. We also provide a generic framework to extend our results to empirical distributions of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness for Gowalla dataset. Finally, we quantify and discuss security and privacy aspects of SRC search on $c$-DAG vs 1D-Tree, mainly mitigation of structural leakage, which makes $c$-DAG a good data structure candidate for deployment in privacy-preserving systems (e.g., searchable encryption) and multimedia retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "c-DAG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bSRC\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8282\u70b9\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u56f4\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709SRC\u641c\u7d22\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684SRC\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u6784c-DAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u6570\uff08c\u22653\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a1D-Tree\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e0e1D-Tree\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "c-DAG\u5728\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u67e5\u8be2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "c-DAG\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e1D-Tree\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u3002"}}

We provide a probabilistic framework for two dominant paradigms: code selection after generation using the execution environment, and code generation conditioned on environment feedback. First, we formalize several well-established selection heuristics as environment-aware estimators of code correctness. We theoretically prove that estimators based on fuzzy functional similarity add an inductive bias and strictly dominate estimators based on functional equivalence in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we frame backprompting as an in-context approximation of Thompson sampling.

Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities.

Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain.

Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS. FlashSketch pushes the Pareto frontier of sketching quality versus speed, across a range of regimes and tasks, and achieves a global geomean speedup of roughly 1.7x over the prior state-of-the-art GPU sketches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86GPU\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8349\u56feBlockPerm-SJLT\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u6838FlashSketch\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.7\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86BlockPerm-SJLT\u7a00\u758f\u8349\u56fe\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4f18\u5316CUDA\u5185\u6838FlashSketch\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u5e73\u8861GPU\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8349\u56fe\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "FlashSketch\u5728RandNLA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cGraSS\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BlockPerm-SJLT\u4e0eFlashSketch\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728GPU\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8349\u56fe\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea61.7\u500d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor.

We present an automated mobile chaos testing system that integrates DragonCrawl, an LLM-based mobile testing platform, with uHavoc, a service-level fault injection system. The key insight is that adaptive AI-driven test execution can navigate mobile applications under degraded backend conditions, eliminating the need to manually write test cases for each combination of user flow, city, and failure type. Since Q1 2024, our system has executed over 180,000 automated chaos tests across 47 critical flows in Uber's Rider, Driver, and Eats applications, representing approximately 39,000 hours of manual testing effort that would be impractical at this scale. We identified 23 resilience risks, with 70% being architectural dependency violations where non-critical service failures degraded core user flows. Twelve issues were severe enough to prevent trip requests or food orders. Two caused application crashes detectable only through mobile chaos testing, not backend testing alone. Automated root cause analysis reduced debugging time from hours to minutes, achieving 88% precision@5 in attributing mobile failures to specific backend services. This paper presents the system design, evaluates its performance under fault injection (maintaining 99% test reliability), and reports operational experience demonstrating that continuous mobile resilience validation is achievable at production scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408DragonCrawl\u548cuHavoc\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u6c8c\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7528\u6237\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u79fb\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u97e7\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408DragonCrawl\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u548cuHavoc\uff08\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199\u6bcf\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u81ea2024\u5e74Q1\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728Uber\u7684Rider\u3001Driver\u548cEats\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc718\u4e07\u6b21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8623\u4e2a\u97e7\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d70%\u4e3a\u67b6\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fdd\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u8c03\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6@5\u8fbe\u523088%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79fb\u52a8\u6df7\u6c8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements.

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks.

While prior advances optimize attention execution for individual requests (e.g., FlashAttention), production LLM serving relies on batching requests with highly heterogeneous sequence lengths for high serving throughput. This mismatch induces severe computation and I/O imbalance, exacerbates stragglers, and underutilizes GPU resources. We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves.

In this vision paper, we re-examine what it means for an AI agent to be considered a software engineer and then critically think about what makes such an agent trustworthy. \\textit{Grounded} in established definitions of software engineering (SE) and informed by recent research on agentic AI systems, we conceptualise AI software engineers as participants in human-AI SE teams composed of human software engineers and AI models and tools, and we distinguish trustworthiness as a key property of these systems and actors rather than a subjective human attitude. Based on historical perspectives and emerging visions, we identify key dimensions that contribute to the trustworthiness of AI software engineers, spanning technical quality, transparency and accountability, epistemic humility, and societal and ethical alignment. We further discuss how trustworthiness can be evaluated and demonstrated, highlighting a fundamental trust measurement gap: not everything that matters for trust can be easily measured. Finally, we outline implications for the design, evaluation, and governance of AI SE systems, advocating for an ethics-by-design approach to enable appropriate trust in future human-AI SE teams.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5021\u5bfc\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u4f26\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7f16\u7801\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8fc5\u901f\u5d1b\u8d77\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u524d\u63d0\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u7591\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003AI\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08SE\uff09\u7684\u65e2\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b-AI SE\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5f71\u54cdAI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6280\u672f\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c26\u900a\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5c55\u793a\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6cbb\u7406AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u2018\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f26\u7406\u2019\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

Conventional biopsy using forceps, needles, or rotating blades is invasive, limited in reach, and carries risks of perforation or mucosal trauma, while fluid- or microbiota-sampling capsules cannot provide structured tissue for pathology, leaving a critical gap in swallowable biopsy solutions. Here we present the Kiri-Capsule, a kirigami-inspired capsule robot that integrates deployable PI-film flaps actuated by a compact dual-cam mechanism to achieve minimally invasive and repeatable tissue collection. The kirigami surface remains flat during locomotion but transforms into sharp protrusions upon cam-driven stretching, enabling controlled penetration followed by rotary scraping, with specimens retained in internal fan-shaped cavities. Bench tests confirmed that PI films exhibit a Young's modulus of approximately 20 MPa and stable deployment angles (about 34$^\\circ$ at 15% strain), while ex vivo porcine studies demonstrated shallow penetration depths (median $\\sim$0.61 mm, range 0.46--0.66 mm) and biopsy yields comparable to standard forceps (mean $\\sim$10.9 mg for stomach and $\\sim$18.9 mg for intestine), with forces within safe ranges reported for GI biopsy.

However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by \"baking in\" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for \"texture baking,\" while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

Unfortunately, understanding and debugging such agents remain challenging due to their complex and dynamic nature. Developers must reason about trajectories of LLM queries, tool calls, and code modifications, but current techniques reveal little of this intermediate process in a comprehensible format. The key insight of this paper is that debugging software development agents shares many similarities with conventional debugging of software programs, yet requires a higher level of abstraction that raises the level from low-level implementation details to high-level agent actions. Drawing on this insight, we introduce AgentStepper, the first interactive debugger for LLM-based software engineering agents. AgentStepper enables developers to inspect, control, and interactively manipulate agent trajectories. AgentStepper represents trajectories as structured conversations among an LLM, the agent program, and tools. It supports breakpoints, stepwise execution, and live editing of prompts and tool invocations, while capturing and displaying intermediate repository-level code changes. Our evaluation applies AgentStepper to three state-of-the-art software development agents, ExecutionAgent, SWE-Agent, and RepairAgent, showing that integrating the approach into existing agents requires minor code changes (39-42 edited lines). Moreover, we report on a user study with twelve participants, indicating that AgentStepper improves the ability of participants to interpret trajectories (64% vs. 67% mean performance) and identify bugs in the agent's implementation (17% vs. 60% success rate), while reducing perceived workload (e.g., frustration reduced from 5.4/7.0 to 2.4/7.0) compared to conventional tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentStepper\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u793a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65ad\u70b9\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u8c03\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u4ee5\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5c55\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65ad\u70b9\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee3\u7406\uff08ExecutionAgent\u3001SWE-Agent\u3001RepairAgent\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210AgentStepper\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6539\uff0839-42\u884c\uff09\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AgentStepper\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0864% vs. 67%\uff09\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0817% vs. 60%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u632b\u8d25\u611f\u4ece5.4/7.0\u964d\u81f32.4/7.0\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentStepper\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

However, these models are computationally complex to evaluate, posing a challenge for popular RL approaches that have been successfully used with simulators to solve complex locomotion tasks but yet struggle with manipulation. This paper introduces a method that bypasses simulators entirely, training RL policies inside world models learned from robots' interactions with real environments. At its core, our approach enables policy training with large-scale diffusion models via a novel decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates its local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency.

They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrAlgoBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LRMs\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6311\u6218\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u7b54\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86GrAlgoBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u8bc4\u4f30LRMs\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9002\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5141\u8bb8\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLRMs\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u8d85\u8fc7120\u65f6\u4f4e\u4e8e50%\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u7531\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6548\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bfc\u81f4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GrAlgoBench\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u5f31\u70b9\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3aLRMs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), as opposed to source code, have been shown to improve summarization quality in traditional encoder-decoder-based code summarization models. However, most large language model (LLM)-based code summarization methods rely on raw code or only incorporate partial AST signals, meaning that the potential of complete AST representation has not been fully explored for LLMs. This paper presents AST(NIT), an AST augmentation and serialization method that preserves lexical details and encodes structural information into LLM-compatible sequences. Experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B model on the CodeXGLUE Python dataset show that the proposed serialized ASTs reduce the length of LLM inputs, require shorter training times, and achieve summarization quality comparable to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "AST(NIT)\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5b8c\u6574AST\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5b8c\u6574AST\u8868\u793a\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAST(NIT)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cdAST\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574AST\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aLLM\u517c\u5bb9\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u5316AST\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86LLM\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u7f29\u77ed\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "AST(NIT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3aLLM\u517c\u5bb9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u6458\u8981\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data.

We evaluated the ability of the LLM-based system to identify the error location and to propose exact solutions that contain no unnecessary actions. To support the LLM in generating exact solutions, we provided it with different types of domain knowledge, including pipeline information, failure management instructions, and data from historical failures. We conducted an ablation study to determine which type of domain knowledge contributed most to solution accuracy. The results show that data from historical failures contributed the most to the system's accuracy, enabling it to produce exact solutions in 92.1% of cases in our dataset. The system correctly identified the error location with 97.4% accuracy when provided with domain knowledge, compared to 84.2% accuracy without it. In conclusion, our findings indicate that LLMs, when provided with data from historical failures, represent a promising approach for automating CI/CD pipeline failure management.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe97.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884cCI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\uff08SAP HANA\uff09\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u7ba1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\uff09\u652f\u6301LLM\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u3002", "result": "\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d92.1%\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a97.4%\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u4e3a84.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u6545\u969c\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics", "summary": "This paper introduces the Mechacnially prOgrammed Radius-adjustable PHysical (MORPH) wheel, a fully passive variable-radius wheel that embeds mechanical behavior logic for torque-responsive transformation. Unlike conventional variable transmission systems relying on actuators, sensors, and active control, the MORPH wheel achieves passive adaptation solely through its geometry and compliant structure. The design integrates a torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust the wheel radius between 80 mm and 45 mm in response to input torque, without any electrical components. The MORPH wheel provides three unique capabilities rarely achieved simultaneously in previous passive designs: (1) bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation through a symmetric coupler; (2) high torque capacity exceeding 10 N with rigid power transmission in drive mode; and (3) precise and repeatable transmission ratio control governed by deterministic kinematics. A comprehensive analytical model was developed to describe the wheel's mechanical behavior logic, establishing threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation. Experimental validation confirmed that the measured torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics closely follow theoretical predictions across wheel weights of 1.8-2.8kg. Robot-level demonstrations on varying loads (0-25kg), slopes, and unstructured terrains further verified that the MORPH wheel passively adjusts its radius to provide optimal transmission ratio. The MORPH wheel exemplifies a mechanically programmed structure, embedding intelligent, context-dependent behavior directly into its physical design. This approach offers a new paradigm for passive variable transmission and mechanical intelligence in robotic mobility systems operating in unpredictable or control-limited environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MORPH\u8f6e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u534a\u5f84\u8f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u626d\u77e9\u54cd\u5e94\u534a\u5f84\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u79fb\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6267\u884c\u5668\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800cMORPH\u8f6e\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u626d\u77e9\u54cd\u5e94\u534a\u5f84\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u626d\u77e9\u54cd\u5e94\u8026\u5408\u5668\u548c\u5f39\u7c27\u52a0\u8f7d\u8fde\u63a5\u652f\u67f1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u572880\u6beb\u7c73\u81f345\u6beb\u7c73\u4e4b\u95f4\u8c03\u8282\u8f6e\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u7535\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6e\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u884c\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u626d\u77e9-\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u529b-\u4f4d\u79fb\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0cMORPH\u8f6e\u57281.8-2.8kg\u91cd\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u626d\u77e9-\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u529b-\u4f4d\u79fb\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8f6e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u5761\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u88ab\u52a8\u8c03\u8282\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MORPH\u8f6e\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u88ab\u52a8\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u79fb\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u53d8\u901f\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u667a\u80fd\u8303\u4f8b\u3002"}}

In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance.

Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI.

We introduce LAAFD, an agentic workflow that uses large language models to translate general-purpose C++ into optimized Vitis HLS kernels. LAAFD automates key transfor mations: deep pipelining, vectorization, and dataflow partitioning and closes the loop with HLS co-simulation and synthesis feedback to verify correctness while iteratively improving execution time in cycles. Over a suite of 15 kernels representing common compute patterns in HPC, LAFFD achieves 99.9% geomean performance when compared to the hand tuned baseline for Vitis HLS.

While machine learning-based fault prediction models have demonstrated high accuracy, their lack of interpretability limits their adoption in industrial settings. Developers need actionable insights that can be directly employed in software quality assurance processes and guide defect mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present a structured process for defining context-specific software metric thresholds suitable for integration into fault detection workflows in industrial settings. Our approach supports cross-project fault prediction by deriving thresholds from one set of projects and applying them to independently developed firmware, thereby enabling reuse across similar software systems without retraining or domain-specific tuning. We analyze three real-world C-embedded firmware projects provided by an industrial partner, using Coverity and Understand static analysis tools to extract software metrics. Through statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, we identify discriminative metrics and derived empirical threshold values capable of distinguishing faulty from non-faulty functions. The derived thresholds are validated through an experimental evaluation, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying fault-prone functions with high precision. The results confirm that the derived thresholds can serve as an interpretable solution for fault prediction, aligning with industry standards and SQA practices. This approach provides a practical alternative to black-box AI models, allowing developers to systematically assess software quality, take preventive actions, and integrate metric-based fault prediction into industrial development workflows to mitigate software faults.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5ea6\u91cf\u9608\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u9ed1\u76d2AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u9879\u76ee\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684C\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u56fa\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u533a\u5206\u6545\u969c\u4e0e\u975e\u6545\u969c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u9608\u503c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u6545\u969c\u503e\u5411\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u548cSQA\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5ea6\u91cf\u9608\u503c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6545\u969c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective.

Existing automated repair methods typically rely on superficial pass/fail signals, offering limited visibility into program behavior and hindering precise error localization. In addition, without a way to learn from prior failures, repair processes often fall into repetitive and inefficient cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that TraceCoder achieves up to a 34.43\\% relative improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over existing advanced baselines. Ablation studies verify the significance of each system component, with the iterative repair process alone contributing a 65.61\\% relative gain in accuracy.

Modern precision robotic motion systems, such as gantries, rely on the flatness of components, including guide rails and granite surface plates. However, translating this static flatness into motion requires precise internal alignment and tight-tolerance components that create long, error-sensitive reference chains. Here, we show that by using the geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane, we can produce robotic motion systems that derive planarity entirely from link lengths and connectivity. This allows planar motion to emerge from self-referencing geometric constraints, and without external metrology. We demonstrate these Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) from micron to meter scales and show that fabrication errors can be attenuated by an order of magnitude in the resulting flatness. Finally, we present a robotic FPM-based 3-axis positioning system that can be used for metrology surface scans ($\\pm 12$-mm) and 3D printing inside narrow containers.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.\n  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u56fe\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982DAG\uff09\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6cbb\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u91ca\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6267\u884c\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff08Theorem A\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5408\u6210\u73af\u5883\u548c\u771f\u5b9eTextWorld\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u52bf\u8870\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u663e\u793a\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u52bf\u968f\u6267\u884c\u957f\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u60ac\u5d16\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u56fe\u72b6\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982DAG\uff09\u3002\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u8f6c\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data.

While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%.

Traditional self-organizing models often require calculations across the entire coordinate space, including empty areas, which is impractical for resource-constrained physical modules. Our proposed model achieves complex morphogenesis through strictly local interactions between adjacent modules within the \"body.\" By extending the \"Ishida token model,\" modules exchange integer values using an RD-inspired discrete analogue without solving differential equations. The internal potential, derived from token accumulation and aging, guides autonomous growth, shrinkage, and replication. Simulations on a hexagonal grid demonstrated the emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration capabilities following structural amputation.

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work.", "AI": {"tldr": "DualMap \u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 LLM \u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u7528\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u91cd\u7528\u4e0e\u8bf7\u6c42\u5747\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "DualMap \u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8bf7\u6c42\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5019\u9009\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 SLO \u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u3001\u70ed\u70b9\u611f\u77e5\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u54c8\u5e0c\u73af\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDualMap \u5728\u76f8\u540c TTFT SLO \u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bf7\u6c42\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 2.25 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DualMap \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u4e0e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Focusing on latent-variable generative policies, we show that hallucinations often arise from structural mismatches between feasible robot behavior and common model architectures.

Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications.

Our goal is to bring HPC-like performance and resilience to serverless and continuum environments while preserving the programmability benefits of skeletons. As a first step, we focus on the well known Farm pattern and its implementation on the open-source OpenFaaS platform, treating autoscaling of the worker pool as a QoS-aware resource management problem. The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS. In particular, we discuss the autoscaling model and its training, and evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) policies against a baseline of reactive management derived from a simple farm performance model.

Existing approaches typically formulate commands in body-centric frames, fail to inherently correct cumulative world-frame drift induced by legged locomotion. We reformulate the problem as world-frame end-effector tracking and propose HiWET, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples global reasoning from dynamic execution. The high-level policy generates subgoals that jointly optimize end-effector accuracy and base positioning in the world frame, while the low-level policy executes these commands under stability constraints. We introduce a Kinematic Manifold Prior (KMP) that embeds the manipulation manifold into the action space via residual learning, reducing exploration dimensionality and mitigating kinematically invalid behaviors. Extensive simulation and ablation studies demonstrate that HiWET achieves precise and stable end-effector tracking in long-horizon world-frame tasks. We validate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the low-level policy on a physical humanoid, demonstrating stable locomotion under diverse manipulation commands.

Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, can learn near-optimal controllers but sometimes struggles with sparse rewards, safe exploration, and long-horizon credit assignment. Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results.

To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol.

However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency.

Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyPER \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u50f5\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u540e\u671f\u624d\u5206\u53c9\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "HyPER \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u5230\u5229\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyPER \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e868%\u81f310%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8625%\u81f340%\u3002", "conclusion": "HyPER \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7Iso-Energy\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50SAE\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0VLMs\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u53ef\u79fb\u9664\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u643a\u5e26\u5168\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9699\u3002\u79fb\u9664\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u95f4\u9699\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Most current approaches to generating these training environments follow an open-loop paradigm, without considering the agent's current performance. While procedural generation methods can produce diverse scenes, diversity without feedback from the agent is inefficient. The generated environments may be trivially easy, providing limited learning signal. To address this, we present a proof-of-concept for closed-loop environment generation that adapts difficulty to the agent's current capabilities. Our system employs a controllable environment representation, extracts fine-grained performance feedback beyond binary success or failure, and implements a closed-loop adaptation mechanism that translates this feedback into environment modifications. This feedback-driven approach generates training environments that more challenging in the ways the agent needs to improve, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization to novel settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u95ed\u73af\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u96be\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5f00\u73af\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9488\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion.

However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines.

To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras.

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property.

SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeeUPO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9aa8\u5e72RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSeeUPO\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u9010\u8f6e\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u5f52\u7eb3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728AppWorld\u548cBFCL v4\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSeeUPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Qwen3-14B\u548cQwen2.5-14B\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8643.3%-54.6%\u548c24.1%-41.9%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "SeeUPO\uff08Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9aa8\u5e72RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability.

PREPRINT VERSION. ACCEPTED FEB, 2026", "summary": "Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods.

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea7\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u7a33\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u6620\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5185\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u7b7e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728SEEDBench\u3001MMMU\u548cPOPE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u4ee3VLMs\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\uff1b3) \u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5f71\u54cd\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u8868\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53d8\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4e5f\u5f71\u54cd\u6270\u52a8\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT.

Existing ON benchmarks typically place objects in locations guided by general scene priors, without accounting for the specific placement habits of individual users. This omission limits the adaptability of navigation agents in personalized household environments. To address this, we introduce User-centric Object Navigation (UcON), a new benchmark that incorporates user-specific object placement habits, referred to as user habits. This benchmark requires agents to leverage these user habits for more informed decision-making during navigation. UcON encompasses approximately 22,600 user habits across 489 object categories. UcON is, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that explicitly formalizes and evaluates habit-conditioned object navigation at scale and covers the widest range of target object categories. Additionally, we propose a habit retrieval module to extract and utilize habits related to target objects, enabling agents to infer their likely locations more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that current SOTA methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under habit-driven object placement, while integrating user habits consistently improves success rates.

Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency.

However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

Existing approaches are typically limited in two ways: they either target a single gripper and are potentially applied on costly dual-arm setups, or rely on custom hybrid grippers that require ad-hoc learning procedures with logic that cannot be transferred across tasks, restricting their general applicability. In this work, we present MultiGraspNet, a novel multitask 3D deep learning method that predicts feasible poses simultaneously for parallel and vacuum grippers within a unified framework, enabling a single robot to handle multiple end effectors. The model is trained on the richly annotated GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets, which have been aligned for the purpose, and generates graspability masks quantifying the suitability of each scene point for successful grasps. By sharing early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, MultiGraspNet effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes. We characterize MultiGraspNet's performance with an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating its competitiveness with single-task models on relevant benchmarks.

Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning.

While these models can simulate realistic visual outcomes, they often exhibit poor action-following precision, hindering their utility for downstream robotic learning. In this work, we introduce World-VLA-Loop, a closed-loop framework for the joint refinement of world models and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. We propose a state-aware video world model that functions as a high-fidelity interactive simulator by jointly predicting future observations and reward signals. To enhance reliability, we introduce the SANS dataset, which incorporates near-success trajectories to improve action-outcome alignment within the world model. This framework enables a closed-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of VLA policies entirely within a virtual environment. Crucially, our approach facilitates a co-evolving cycle: failure rollouts generated by the VLA policy are iteratively fed back to refine the world model precision, which in turn enhances subsequent RL optimization. Evaluations across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts VLA performance with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning.

Policies learned on such data, which is heavily skewed towards a few data-rich head tasks, frequently exhibit poor generalization when confronted with the vast number of data-scarce tail tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pervasive long-tail challenge inherent in policy learning. Our analysis begins by demonstrating the inefficacy of conventional long-tail learning strategies (e.g., re-sampling) for improving the policy's performance on tail tasks. We then uncover the underlying mechanism for this failure, revealing that data scarcity on tail tasks directly impairs the policy's spatial reasoning capability.

Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that \"confirmation bias\" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08EIG\u548cPTS\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0EIG\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cPTS\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301'\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef'\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7406\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7406\u6027\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff08EIG\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6b63\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff08PTS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cEIG\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u590d\u5408\u6216\u4f8b\u5916\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002PTS\u867d\u4fe1\u606f\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9'\u5b89\u5168'\u67e5\u8be2\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u6848\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u4e0a\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c'\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef'\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u975e\u8ba4\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7279\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7406\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u3002"}}

This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%.

Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $\u03c4^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScaleEnv\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u96f6\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u5168\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u7a00\u7f3a\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ScaleEnv\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "ScaleEnv\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u786e\u4fdd\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982$\u03c4^2$-Bench\u548cVitaBench\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cScaleEnv\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ScaleEnv\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660e\u589e\u52a0\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In order to enable robots to verify these properties, we introduce the Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion as an axiomatic correctness specification for body motions. To that end we introduce scoped Task-Environment-Embodiment (TEE) classes that represent world states as Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and define applicable physics models to decompose task achievement into three predicates: SatisfiesRequest for semantic request satisfaction over SDT state evolution; Causes for causal sufficiency under the scoped physics model; and CanPerform for safety and feasibility verification at the embodiment level. This decomposition yields a reusable, implementation-independent interface that supports motion synthesis and the verification of given body motions. It also supports typed failure diagnosis (semantic, causal, embodiment and out-of-scope), feasibility across robots and environments, and counterfactual reasoning about robot body motions.

In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors.

However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets.

This early fusion lets embodied state participate in subsequent visual reasoning and token selection, biasing computation toward action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens. In a systematic ablation over proprioception encoding, state entry point, and action-head conditioning, we find that text tokenization is more effective than learned projectors, and that retaining roughly 15% of visual tokens can match the performance of using the full token set.

Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances.

In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline.

Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u529b\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u529b\u6307\u4ee4\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u529b\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u529b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65f6\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u529b\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e66\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization.

First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bca\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff08TAU-bench Airline\u548cAssistantBench\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u8bca\u65ad\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u6545\u969c\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\uff082.7\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u529f\u6982\u738749%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

RAPID is built around a tool-free, modular hardware architecture that unifies handheld data collection and robot deployment, and a matching software stack that maintains real-time awareness of the underlying hardware configuration through a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events. This modular hardware architecture reduces reconfiguration to seconds and makes systematic multi-modal ablation studies practical, allowing researchers to sweep diverse gripper and sensing configurations without repeated system bring-up. The Physical Mask exposes modality presence as an explicit runtime signal, enabling auto-configuration and graceful degradation under sensor hot-plug events, so policies can continue executing when sensors are physically added or removed. System-centric experiments show that RAPID reduces the setup time for multi-modal configurations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and preserves policy execution under runtime sensor hot-unplug events.

To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others.

However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality.

Authors Antareep Singha and Laksh Nanwani have equal contributions", "summary": "Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense, unstructured human crowds remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.", "AI": {"tldr": "Crowd-FM\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u73af\u5883\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CFM\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u78b0\u649e\u81ea\u7531\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "CFM\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u81ea\u7531\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bc4\u5206\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "Crowd-FM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like \"Perceive-Reflect-Adjust\" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution.

This work proposes a sampling-based approach for continuous coverage estimation that explores reachable surface regions in the configuration space. We define an extended ambient configuration space that allows for the representation of tool position and orientation constraints. A continuation-based approach is used to explore it using two different sampling strategies. A thorough evaluation across different kinematics and environments analyzes their runtime and efficiency. This validates our ability to accurately and efficiently calculate surface coverage for complex surfaces in complicated environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u5177\u5782\u76f4\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u73af\u5883\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u5177\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ef6\u7eed\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8986\u76d6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u8868\u9762\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards.

Code and videos are available at https://sure-nav.github.io/", "summary": "We address the over-constrained planning problem in semi-static environments. The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.", "AI": {"tldr": "SuReNav\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u548c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "SuReNav\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u5730\u56fe\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\uff1b3\uff09\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u677e\u5f1b\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u8bed\u4e49\u5730\u56fe\u548cOpenStreetMap\u76843D\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0cSuReNav\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5bfc\u822a\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SuReNav\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D\u548c3D\u5730\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Here we present \\textit{AirPulse}, a 26-gram butterfly-inspired FWMAV that achieves fully onboard, closed-loop, untethered flight without auxiliary control surfaces. The AirPulse robot replicates key biomechanical traits of butterfly flight, including low wing aspect ratio, compliant carbon-fiber-reinforced wings, and low-frequency, high-amplitude flapping that induces cyclic variations in the center of gravity and moment of inertia, producing characteristic body undulation. We establish a quantitative mapping between flapping modulation parameters and force-torque generation, and introduce the Stroke Timing Asymmetry Rhythm (STAR) generator, enabling smooth, stable, and linearly parameterized wingstroke asymmetry for flapping control. Integrating these with an attitude controller, the AirPulse robot maintains pitch and yaw stability despite strong oscillatory dynamics. Free-flight experiments demonstrate stable climbing and turning maneuvers via either angle offset or stroke timing modulation, marking the first onboard controlled flight of the lightest two-winged, tailless butterfly-inspired FWMAV reported in peer-reviewed literature. This work corroborates a foundational platform for lightweight, collision-proof FWMAVs, bridging biological inspiration with practical aerial robotics. Their non-invasive maneuverability is ideally suited for real-world applications, such as confined-space inspection and ecological monitoring, inaccessible to traditional drones, while their biomechanical fidelity provides a physical model to decode the principles underlying the erratic yet efficient flight of real butterflies.", "AI": {"tldr": "AirPulse\u662f\u4e00\u79cd26\u514b\u8774\u8776\u7075\u611fFWMAV\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u548cSTAR\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7FWMAV\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u5c3e\u53cc\u7ffcFWMAV\u7684\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ffc\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u8774\u8776\u98de\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u4f4e\u7ffc\u5c55\u6bd4\u3001\u67d4\u987a\u7684\u78b3\u7ea4\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\u7ffc\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u9ad8\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u6251\u52a8\uff0cAirPulse\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u673a\u8f7d\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u3001\u65e0\u7ef3\u98de\u884c\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6251\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u529b-\u626d\u77e9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Stroke Timing Asymmetry Rhythm\uff08STAR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6251\u52a8\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u7531\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u6251\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u722c\u5347\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u673a\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u6700\u8f7b\u53cc\u7ffc\u65e0\u5c3e\u8774\u8776\u7075\u611fFWMAV\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u8f7d\u63a7\u5236\u98de\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9632\u78b0\u649e\u7684FWMAV\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u7075\u611f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5176\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u7684\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u72ed\u7a84\u7a7a\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e6\u53ca\u7684\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u771f\u5b9e\u8774\u8776\u98de\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u539f\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways.

However, applying it to textureless objects remains a challenge due to the absence of reliable visual features. Moreover, adverse visual conditions, such as occlusions, often corrupt visual feedback, leading to reduced accuracy and instability in visual servoing. In this work, we build upon learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects and propose a method that enhances robustness by tightly integrating perception and control in a closed loop. Specifically, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that integrates per-frame keypoint measurements to estimate 6D object pose, which drives pose-based visual servoing (PBVS) for control.

Additionally, unlike standard PBVS, we propose a probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and its associated uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware control for safe and reliable operation.

We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module.

Conventional formulations typically assume deterministic contact events, which limit robustness and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose SURE, a robust trajectory optimization framework that explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty. By allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, SURE achieves both robustness and computational efficiency within a unified optimization framework. We evaluate SURE on two representative tasks with unknown impact times. In a cart-pole balancing task involving uncertain wall location, SURE achieves an average improvement of 21.6% in success rate when branch switching is enabled during control. In an egg-catching experiment using a robotic manipulator, SURE improves the success rate by 40%.

However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's \"pure\" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation.

Success in this domain requires drones not only to navigate at their limits but also to anticipate and counteract competitors' actions. In this paper, we study a fundamental question that arises in this domain: how deeply should an agent strategize before taking an action? To this end, we compare two planning paradigms: the Model Predictive Game (MPG), which finds interaction-aware strategies at the expense of longer computation times, and contouring Model Predictive Control (MPC), which computes strategies rapidly but does not reason about interactions. We perform extensive experiments to study this trade-off, revealing that MPG outperforms MPC at moderate velocities but loses its advantage at higher speeds due to latency. To address this shortcoming, we propose a Learned Model Predictive Game (LMPG) approach that amortizes model predictive gameplay to reduce latency.

However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed.

However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability.

However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process.

ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation.

Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation.

Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection.

Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter.

However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes.

This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding.

However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario.

Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions.

Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPARC\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982token\u9884\u7b97\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "SPARC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "SPARC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728V* VQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06Qwen3VL-4B\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728OOD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ee5200\u500d\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u201cthinking with images\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "SPARC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m.

We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets.

However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods.

However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images.

In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier.

The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data.

We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity.

Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable.

Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NanoFLUX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece17B FLUX.1-Schnell\u84b8\u998f\u800c\u6765\u76842.4B\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u52a0\u5927\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4ece12B\u538b\u7f29\u81f32B\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eResNet\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91c7\u6837\u671f\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "NanoFLUX\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u751f\u6210512x512\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea62.5\u79d2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NanoFLUX\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u9002\u5408\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.\n  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.\n  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle.

However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert.

SICA: Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation for Unified-Yet-Discriminative Artifact Feature Space Reconstruction", "comment": null, "summary": "Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative\" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities.

However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects.

Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs.

We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models.

When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting.

In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks.

In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets.

To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CineScene\u5229\u7528\u9690\u5f0f3D\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u666f\u62cd\u6444\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e3b\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528VGGT\u7f16\u7801\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62fc\u63a5\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u6ce8\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6253\u4e71\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "CineScene\u5728\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "CineScene\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f3D\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.
