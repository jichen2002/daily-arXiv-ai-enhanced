Users need to wait minutes to days to start their jobs, which only takes a few seconds for execution. Current quantum cloud platforms employ a fair-share scheduler, as there is no way to multiplex a quantum computer among multiple programs at the same time, leaving many qubits idle and significantly under-utilizing the hardware. This imbalance between high user demand and scarce quantum resources has become a key barrier to scalable and cost-effective quantum computing.\n  We present HALO, the first quantum operating system design that supports fine-grained resource-sharing. HALO introduces two complementary mechanisms. First, a hardware-aware qubit-sharing algorithm that places shared helper qubits on regions of the quantum computer that minimize routing overhead and avoid cross-talk noise between different users' processes. Second, a shot-adaptive scheduler that allocates execution windows according to each job's sampling requirements, improving throughput and reducing latency. Together, these mechanisms transform the way quantum hardware is scheduled and achieve more fine-grained parallelism.\n  We evaluate HALO on the IBM Torino quantum computer on helper qubit intense benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art systems such as HyperQ, HALO improves overall hardware utilization by up to 2.44x, increasing throughput by 4.44x, and maintains fidelity loss within 33%, demonstrating the practicality of resource-sharing in quantum computing."}

Because each exploration path may modify files and spawn processes, agents require isolated environments with atomic commit and rollback semantics for both filesystem state and process state. We introduce the branch context, a new OS abstraction that provides: (1) copy-on-write state isolation with independent filesystem views and process groups, (2) a structured lifecycle of fork, explore, and commit/abort, (3) first-commit-wins resolution that automatically invalidates sibling branches, and (4) nestable contexts for hierarchical exploration. We realize branch contexts in Linux through two complementary components. First, BranchFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that gives each branch context an isolated copy-on-write workspace, with O(1) creation, atomic commit to the parent, and automatic sibling invalidation, all without root privileges. BranchFS is open sourced in https://github.com/multikernel/branchfs. Second, branch() is a proposed Linux syscall that spawns processes into branch contexts with reliable termination, kernel-enforced sibling isolation, and first-commit-wins coordination.

First, they lack multi-tenancy support, failing to handle stacked homogeneous or heterogeneous workloads.

By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

While there has been work in automatic approximate convex decompositions of meshes using convex hulls, they are not practical for applications with tight performance budgets such as games due to slower collision detection and inability to manually modify the output while maintaining convexity as compared to manually placed primitives. Rather than convex decomposition with convex hulls, we devise an approach for bottom-up decomposition of an input mesh into convex primitives specifically for rigid body simulation inspired by quadric mesh simplification. This approach fits primitives to complex, real-world meshes that provide plausible simulation performance and are guaranteed to enclose the input surface. We test convex primitive decomposition on over 60 models from Sketchfab, showing the algorithm's effectiveness. On this dataset, convex primitive decomposition has lower one-way mean and median Hausdorff and Chamfer distance from the collider to the input compared to V-HACD and CoACD, with less than one-third of the complexity as measured by total bytes for each collider. On top of that, rigid-body simulation performance measured by wall-clock time is consistently improved across 24 tested models."}

In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing."}

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

Most existing performance evaluations rely on synthetic traffic scenarios generated by simulators, which, while useful, may not fully capture the features of real-world traffic. In this paper, we present a large-scale, data-driven evaluation of V2X communication performance using real-world traffic datasets. Vehicle trajectories derived from the Highway Drone (HighD) and Intersection Drone (InD) datasets are converted into simulation-ready formats and coupled with a standardized V2X networking stack to enable message-level performance analysis for entire traffic populations comprising over hundred thousands vehicles across multiple locations. We evaluate key V2X performance indicators, including inter-generation gap, inter-packet gap, packet delivery ratio, and channel busy ratio, across both highway and urban intersection environments. Our results show that cooperative awareness services remain feasible at scale under realistic traffic conditions. In addition, the findings highlight how traffic density, mobility patterns, and communication range influence V2X performance and how synthetic traffic assumptions may overestimate channel congestion."}

This paper introduces the Knowledge Sharing paradigm as an innovative approach that uses the semantic richness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and the representational power of Graph Embeddings (GEs) to achieve decentralized intelligence. Our architecture empowers individual nodes to locally construct semantic representations of their operational context, iteratively aggregating embeddings through neighbor-based exchanges using GraphSAGE. This iterative local aggregation process results in a dynamically evolving global semantic abstraction called Knowledge Map, enabling coordinated decision-making without centralized control. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments under a distributed resource orchestration use case. We simulate different network topologies and node workloads, analyzing the local semantic drift of individual nodes. Experimental results confirm that our distributed knowledge-sharing mechanism effectively maintains semantic coherence and adaptability, making it suitable for complex and dynamic environments such as Edge Computing, IoT, and multi-agent systems."}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

Using a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) parameterization of the Koopman operator, our method learns the temporal evolution of deformable dynamics and predicts future states through efficient matrix evaluations instead of sequential time integration. This yields log-linear scaling in the number of time steps and allows large portions of the trajectory to be skipped while retaining accuracy. The resulting temporal efficiency is especially advantageous for optimization tasks such as control and initial-state estimation, where the objective often depends largely on the final configuration.\n  To broaden the scope of Koopman-based reduced-order models in graphics, we introduce a discretization-agnostic extension that learns shared dynamic behavior across multiple shapes and mesh resolutions. Prior DMD-based approaches have been restricted to a single shape and discretization, which limits their usefulness for tasks involving geometry variation. Our formulation generalizes across both shape and discretization, which enables fast shape optimization that was previously impractical for DMD models. This expanded capability highlights the potential of Koopman operator learning as a practical tool for efficient deformable simulation and design."}

However, this signal-level fidelity-oriented design often incurs high communication overhead and system complexity, particularly in video communication scenarios where mainstream frameworks rely on transmitting visual data itself, resulting in significant bandwidth consumption. To address this issue, we propose a visual data-free communication framework, Mirage, for extremely efficient video transmission while preserving semantic information. Mirage decomposes video content into two complementary components: temporal sequence information capturing motion dynamics and spatial appearance representations describing overall visual structure. Temporal information is preserved through video captioning, while key frames are encoded into compact semantic representations for spatial appearance. These representations are transmitted to the receiver, where videos are synthesized using generative video models. Since no raw visual data is transmitted, Mirage is inherently privacy-preserving. Mirage also supports personalized adaptation across deployment scenarios. The sender, network, and receiver can independently impose constraints on semantic representation, transmission, and generation, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency, privacy, control, and perceptual quality. Experimental results in video transmission demonstrate that Mirage achieves up to a 50000X data-level compression speedup over raw video transmission, with gains expected to scale with larger video content sizes."}

Packing algorithms seek to arrange a set of charts within a fixed-size atlas with as little downscaling as possible. Many packing applications such as content creation tools, dynamic atlas generation for video games, and texture space shading require on-the-fly interactive atlas packing. Unfortunately, while many methods have been developed for generating tight high-quality packings, they are designed for offline settings and have running times two or more orders of magnitude greater than what is required for interactive performance. While real-time GPU packing methods exist, they significantly downscale packed charts compared to offline methods. We introduce a GPU packing method that targets interactive speeds, provides packing quality approaching that of offline methods, and supports flexible user control over the tradeoff between performance and quality. We observe that current real-time packing methods leave large gaps between charts and often produce asymmetric, or poorly balanced, packings. These artifacts dramatically degrade packing quality. Our Tight And Balanced method eliminates these artifacts while retaining Interactive performance. TABI generates tight packings by compacting empty space between irregularly shaped charts both horizontally and vertically, using two approximations of chart shape that support efficient parallel processing. We balance packing outputs by automatically adjusting atlas row widths and orientations to accommodate varying chart heights. We show that our method significantly reduces chart downscaling compared to existing interactive methods while remaining orders of magnitude faster than offline alternatives."}

This is perhaps surprising, as previous work on expanders only succeeded in designing LCAs for \\emph{sparse spanning subgraphs}, rather than full spanning trees. We design an LCA with probe complexity $ O\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 n}{φ^2} + d\\right)\\right)$ for graphs with conductance at least $ φ$ and maximum degree at most $ d $ (not necessarily constant), which is nearly optimal when $φ$ and $d$ are constants, since $Ω(\\sqrt{n})$ probes are necessary even for expanders. Next, we show that for the natural class of \\emph{\\ER graphs} $ G(n, p) $ with $ np = n^δ $ for any constant $ δ> 0 $ (which are expanders with high probability), the $ \\sqrt{n} $ lower bound can be bypassed. Specifically, we give an \\emph{average-case} LCA for such graphs with probe complexity $ \\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n^{1 - δ}})$.\n  Finally, we extend our techniques to design LCAs for the \\emph{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem on weighted expander graphs. Specifically, given a $d$-regular unweighted graph $\\bar{G}$ with sufficiently strong expansion, we consider the weighted graph $G$ obtained by assigning to each edge an independent and uniform random weight from $\\{1,\\ldots,W\\}$, where $W = O(d)$. We show that there exists an LCA that is consistent with an exact MST of $G$, with probe complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}d^2)$."}

We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm.

We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes.

It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings.

Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

First, we design an algorithm that computes an upper bound for the \\emph{weighted max-min $2k$-matching problem}, where the chosen set must contain exactly $2k$ vertices. Building on this bound, we develop a general algorithm with a \\emph{$2 \\ln n$-approximation guarantee} that runs in $O(n^4)$ time.

Experiments show that the lower bounds from our approximation algorithm and the upper bounds from the ear decomposition method are consistently close, yielding empirically small constant-factor approximations.

In this paper, we develop two topology design methods that explicitly operate under real-world deployment constraints: the Long--Short Links (LSL) method, which systematically combines long-distance shortcut links with short-distance local links, and the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which constructs topologies via stochastic optimization.

This enables shared-memory semantics for distributed computing, but introduces new resilience challenges: a node failure leads to the loss of the dirty data in its caches, corrupting application state. Unfortunately, the CXL specification does not consider processor failures. Moreover, when a component fails, the specification tries to isolate it and continue application execution; there is no attempt to bring the application to a consistent state. To address these limitations, this paper extends the CXL specification to be resilient to node failures, and to correctly recover the application after node failures. We call the system ReCXL. To handle the failure of nodes, ReCXL augments the coherence transaction of a write with messages that propagate the update to a small set of other nodes (i.e., Replicas). Replicas save the update in a hardware Logging Unit. Such replication ensures resilience to node failures. Then, at regular intervals, the Logging Units dump the updates to memory. Recovery involves using the logs in the Logging Units to bring the directory and memory to a correct state. Our evaluation shows that ReCXL enables fault-tolerant execution with only a 30% slowdown over the same platform with no fault-tolerance support."}

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably.

To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations."}

While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

To mitigate extensive request timeouts caused by accumulation, systems for inference pipelines commonly drop a subset of requests so the remaining ones can satisfy latency constraints. Since it is commonly believed that request dropping adversely affects goodput, existing systems only drop requests when they have to, which we call reactive dropping. However, this reactive policy can not maintain high goodput, as it neither makes timely dropping decisions nor identifies the proper set of requests to drop, leading to issues of dropping requests too late or dropping the wrong set of requests.\n  We propose that the inference system should proactively drop certain requests in advance to enhance the goodput across the entire workload. To achieve this, we design an inference system PARD. It enhances goodput with timely and precise dropping decisions by integrating a proactive dropping method that decides when to drop requests using runtime information of the inference pipeline, and an adaptive request priority mechanism that selects which specific requests to drop based on remaining latency budgets and workload intensity. Evaluation on a cluster of 64 GPUs over real-world workloads shows that PARD achieves $16\\%$-$176\\%$ higher goodput than the state of the art while reducing the drop rate and wasted computation resources by $1.6\\times$-$17\\times$ and $1.5\\times$-$62\\times$ respectively."}

When facing context-dense product imagery and multimodal defects, current reference-based methods (e.g., SSIM, FID) lack explainability, while model-as-judge approaches lack domain-grounded, fine-grained reward signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance. The dataset and model will be released upon acceptance."}

While super-resolution is widely used in production, it uniformly sacrifices spatial detail and cannot exploit variations in noise, reconstruction difficulty, and perceptual importance across the image. Adaptive sampling offers a compelling alternative, but existing end-to-end approaches rely on approximations that break down in sparse regimes.\n  We introduce an end-to-end adaptive sampling and denoising pipeline explicitly designed for the sub-1-spp regime. Our method uses a stochastic formulation of sample placement that enables gradient estimation despite discrete sampling decisions, allowing stable training of a neural sampler at low sampling budgets. To better align optimization with human perception, we propose a tonemapping-aware training pipeline that integrates differentiable filmic operators and a state-of-the-art perceptual loss, preventing oversampling of regions with low visual impact.\n  In addition, we introduce a gather-based pyramidal denoising filter and a learnable generalization of albedo demodulation tailored to sparse sampling. Our results show consistent improvements over uniform sparse sampling, with notably better reconstruction of perceptually critical details such as specular highlights and shadow boundaries, and demonstrate that adaptive sampling remains effective even at minimal budgets."}

Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference.

Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities."}

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

Most vector databases adopt graph-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms, such as DiskANN (Subramanya et al., 2019), which have demonstrated state-of-the-art empirical performance. DiskANN's graph construction is governed by a reachability parameter $α$, which gives a trade-off between construction time, query time, and accuracy. However, adaptively tuning this trade-off typically requires rebuilding the index for different $α$ values, which is prohibitive at scale. In this work, we propose RP-Tuning, an efficient post-hoc routine, based on DiskANN's pruning step, to adjust the $α$ parameter without reconstructing the full index. Within the $α$-reachability framework of prior theoretical works (Indyk and Xu, 2023; Gollapudi et al., 2025), we prove that pruning an initially $α$-reachable graph with RP-Tuning preserves worst-case reachability guarantees in general metrics and improved guarantees in Euclidean metrics. Empirically, we show that RP-Tuning accelerates DiskANN tuning on four public datasets by up to $43\\times$ with negligible overhead."}

This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors.

To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation.

Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\\sum_{v \\in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\\varepsilon)^{\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\\varepsilon>0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\\!\\left(n\\cdot \\mathrm{tw}(G^2)\\cdot L^{\\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\\right)$ time.

In the nonnegative-reward regime, we give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NAGL in two settings: (i) given a proper $q$-coloring of $G^2$, we obtain a $1/q$-approximation; and (ii) on planar graphs of bounded maximum degree, we develop a Baker-type polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which becomes an efficient PTAS (EPTAS) when $L$ is constant."}

This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic.

Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead.

We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing.

Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications.

As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying.\n  MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription.

To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds."}

While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

We give a $\\frac{2k\\ln2}{1+\\ln2}+O(\\sqrt{k})<0.819k+O(\\sqrt{k})$ approximation for this problem. Our result is the first multiplicative improvement over the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for general $k$.

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration."}

We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments.

A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines.

Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%).

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures."}

This first stage is an intricate adaptation of the bicriteria approximation algorithm by Mettu and Plaxton [Machine Learning 2004] to incremental graphs.

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks.

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance. These results confirm the not-yet-unleashed potential of scalable decentralized solutions and question the need for the heavy signaling overheads and architectural complexity associated with emerging centralized solutions like Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC)."}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

Consider a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$. In the exact Cartesian tree matching problem, the task is to find all length-$m$ fragments of $T$ whose Cartesian tree coincides with the Cartesian tree $CT(P)$ of the pattern. Although the exact version of the problem can be solved in linear time [Park et al., TCS 2020], it remains rather restrictive; for example, it is not robust to outliers in the pattern.\n  To overcome this limitation, we consider the approximate setting, where the goal is to identify all fragments of $T$ that are close to some string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. In this work, we quantify closeness via the widely used Hamming distance metric. For a given integer parameter $k>0$, we present an algorithm that computes all fragments of $T$ that are at Hamming distance at most $k$ from a string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$.

Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop.

To address this gap, we build on Natural Language Processing methods that extract structural networks from textual requirements. Using these extracted structures, we conducted a controlled experiment employing molecular integration tasks as structurally isomorphic proxies for requirements integration - leveraging the topological equivalence between molecular graphs and requirement networks while eliminating confounding factors such as domain expertise and semantic ambiguity. Our results demonstrate that spectral measures predict integration effort with correlations exceeding 0.95, while structural metrics achieve correlations above 0.89. Notably, density-based metrics show no significant predictive validity. These findings indicate that eigenvalue-derived measures capture cognitive and effort dimensions that simpler connectivity metrics cannot. As a result, this research bridges a critical methodological gap between architectural complexity analysis and requirements engineering practice, providing a validated foundation for applying these metrics to requirements engineering, where similar structural complexity patterns may predict integration effort."}

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks."}

To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts.

In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives.

A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance.

After automated filtering and expert human validation, 3,722 questions are retained as a high-confidence evaluation set, while the full pool is released to support training and fine-tuning of 6G-specialized models. Using 6G-Bench, we evaluate 22 foundation models spanning dense and mixture-of-experts architectures, short- and long-context designs (up to 1M tokens), and both open-weight and proprietary systems. Across models, deterministic single-shot accuracy (pass@1) spans a wide range from 0.22 to 0.82, highlighting substantial variation in semantic reasoning capability. Leading models achieve intent and policy reasoning accuracy in the range 0.87--0.89, while selective robustness analysis on reasoning-intensive tasks shows pass@5 values ranging from 0.20 to 0.91. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the 6G-Bench dataset on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/6G-Bench"}

However, environment erosion-the rapid evolution of hardware and software ecosystems for machine learning-has rendered many published MLE notebooks non-reproducible in contemporary environments, hindering code reuse and scientific progress. To quantify this gap, we study 12,720 notebooks mined from 79 popular Kaggle competitions: only 35.4% remain reproducible today. Crucially, we find that environment backporting, i.e., downgrading dependencies to match the submission time, does not improve reproducibility but rather introduces additional failure modes.\n  To address environment erosion, we design and implement MLEModernizer, an LLM-driven agentic framework that treats the contemporary environment as a fixed constraint and modernizes notebook code to restore reproducibility. MLEModernizer iteratively executes notebooks, collects execution feedback, and applies targeted fixes in three types: error-repair, runtime-reduction, and score-calibration. Evaluated on 7,402 notebooks that are non-reproducible under the baseline environment, MLEModernizer makes 5,492 (74.2%) reproducible. MLEModernizer enables practitioners to validate, reuse, and maintain MLE artifacts as the hardware and software ecosystems continue to evolve."}

The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model."}

We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems.

Meanwhile, IPv6's massive address space breaks per-IP reputation and makes many defenses either non-scalable or narrowly scoped (e.g., only internal threats, only RA abuse, or only volumetric floods). We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions. We report results from a BMv2 prototype and validate the same pipeline on a Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC, and we discuss limitations and open directions."}

Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2° in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map."}

We introduce a scalable pipeline that converts noisy pull request diffs into Search/Replace edit blocks through reconstruction and validation, resulting in the largest publicly available corpus of 2 million pull requests spanning 12 programming languages.

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline.

Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.\n  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods.

The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.\n  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences.

However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact.

This issue, known as patch overfitting, has become a key concern in the APR community, with numerous approaches proposed to address it. Very recent work proposes a pre-trained language model (PLM)-based automated patch correctness assessment (APCA) approach, indicating the potential of such PLMs in reasoning about patch correctness. Despite being promising, it is still far from perfect due to various limitations, such as the training paradigm and training dataset. In this paper, we present ComPass, a PLM-based APCA approach that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to address the technical limitations of prior work. Our work is inspired by the opportunity to integrate contrastive learning with recent PLMs in the field of patch correctness assessment, where large-scale labeled patches are difficult to obtain. ComPass utilizes code transformation rules to generate semantic-preserving code snippets for both unlabeled pre-training corpus and labeled fine-tuning patches. ComPass then pre-trains PLMs with contrastive learning, which captures code features with the same semantics but different structures. ComPass finally integrates representation embeddings of patch code snippets and fine-tunes PLMs with a binary classifier jointly to assess patch code correctness. Experimental results on 2274 real-world patches from Defects4J demonstrate that ComPass achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline APPT."}

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications."}

Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\".

Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents. Notably, without context management or other tricks, we obtain 62.2% accuracy with GPT-5-Medium on BrowseComp, surpassing the original 54.9% reported by GPT-5-High."}

Using a Systematic Mapping approach, including automatic search and snowballing techniques, we analyzed 76 DMMs to answer two Research Questions: (RQ1) What are the most frequent dimensions in DMMs? and (RQ2) How are these dimensions described, including their components? We reconcile varying interpretations of the ten most frequent dimensions -- Organization, Strategy, Technology, Culture, Process, Operations, People, Management, Customer, and Data -- and propose integrative definitions for each.

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations.

To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate.

Our study analyzed 980 ADRs across 109 GitHub repositories using a multi-model pipeline in which one LLM primary screens potential decision violations, and three additional LLMs independently validate the reasoning.

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs."}

Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases.

The framework is developed following a Design Science Research methodology. HAIF explicitly addresses the central adoption paradox: the more capable AI becomes, the harder it is to justify the oversight the framework demands-and yet the greater the consequences of not providing it. The paper includes domain-specific validation checklists, adaptation guidance for non-software environments, and an examination of the framework's structural limitations-including the increasingly common pattern of continuous human-AI co-production that challenges the discrete delegation model.

ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split.

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy."}

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications.

We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types."}

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning."}

We show that these viral narratives were overwhelmingly human-driven. Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic \"heartbeat\" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths). These methods generalize to emerging multi-agent systems where attribution of autonomous versus human-directed behavior is critical."}

We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing four sequence modelling architectures: Transformer, Mamba state-space, monodirectional LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models. In total, 396 models are trained across multiple dataset configurations and evaluated using relative Levenshtein edit distance with statistical significance testing. Transformer achieves the lowest mean relative edit distance (0.111), followed by Mamba (0.145), mono-LSTM (0.186), and bi-LSTM (0.265), where lower values are better. Mamba provides competitive accuracy with substantially lower computational cost. Character-level tokenization generally improves performance, sequence length has negligible practical impact on Transformer accuracy, and both Mamba and Transformer demonstrate stronger sample efficiency than recurrent models. Overall, Transformers reduce parsing error by 23.4%, while Mamba is a strong alternative under data or compute constraints. These results also clarify the roles of representation choice, sequence length, and sample efficiency, providing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners."}

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines.

We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

Automated Linter Configuration via DSL-Based LLM Compilation of Coding Standards", "comment": "Accepted By FSE2026", "summary": "Coding standards are essential for maintaining consistent and high-quality code across teams and projects. Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters."}

We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results.

However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

In this paper, we argue that environment setup success should be evaluated through executable evidence rather than a single binary signal. We introduce the Environment Maturity Hierarchy, which defines three success levels based on progressively stronger execution requirements, culminating in successful execution of a project's main entry point. Guided by this hierarchy, we propose HerAgent, an automated environment setup approach that incrementally constructs executable environments through execution-based validation and repair. We evaluate HerAgent on four public benchmarks, where it outperforms all related work, achieving up to 79.6\\% improvement due to its holistic understanding of project structure and dependencies.

We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations."}

Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning.

In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, after controlling for code length, classical metrics exhibit no consistent correlation with LLM performance, revealing a fundamental mismatch with model-perceived difficulty. To address this gap, we propose LM-CC, a novel code complexity metric designed from the perspective of LLMs. The core premise of LM-CC is that LLM-perceived difficulty is driven by the nonlinearity of program semantics. Accordingly, we decompose programs into semantic units based on entropy, organize these units into a compositional hierarchy, and quantify complexity as a principled aggregation of compositional level and branching-induced divergence, capturing cumulative model uncertainty during code processing. Our extensive experiments show that LM-CC not only correlates more strongly with LLM performance than traditional metrics but also that lowering it directly enhances task performance."}

Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities. This work signals how future robots can leverage different embodiment configurations to obtain the benefit of multiple robots within a single body."}

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Android app logs serve as crucial computer resources, aiding developers in debugging and monitoring the status of Android apps, while also containing a wealth of software system information. Previous studies have acknowledged privacy leaks in software logs and Android apps as significant issues without providing a comprehensive view of the privacy leaks in Android app logs. In this study, we build a comprehensive dataset of Android app logs and conduct an empirical study to analyze the status and severity of privacy leaks in Android app logs. Our study comprises three aspects: (1) Understanding real-world developers' concerns regarding privacy issues related to software logs; (2) Studying privacy leaks in the Android app logs; (3) Investigating the characteristics of privacy-leaking Android app logs and analyzing the reasons behind them. Our study reveals five different categories of concerns from real-world developers regarding privacy issues related to software logs and the prevalence of privacy leaks in Android app logs, with the majority stemming from developers' unawareness of such leaks. Additionally, our study provides developers with suggestions to safeguard their privacy from being logged."}

The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time."}

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.\n  To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks."}

Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement."}

The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation."}

We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving \"verification by construction\" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall."}

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution."}

It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \\( n \\)-tuples.

Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

In this vision paper, we introduce Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks from the health sciences, which propose gathering experts in panels to assess the existing best evidence about the impact of an intervention in all relevant outcomes and make structured recommendations based on them. The insight we can leverage from EtD frameworks is not their structure per se but all the relevant criteria for making recommendations to practitioners from SLRs.

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt.

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots. The demonstration video is available at https://sites.google.com/view/colf/."}

On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline.

While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results in table understanding, they typically assume the relevant table is readily available. However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks."}

Automated documentation generation has evolved from heuristic and rule-based methods to neural network-based and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing methods often overlook structural and quantitative characteristics of code that influence readability and comprehension. Prior research suggests that code metrics capture information relevant to program understanding. Building on these insights, this paper investigates the role of source code metrics as auxiliary signals for automated documentation generation, focusing on computational notebooks, a popular medium among data scientists that integrates code, narrative, and results but suffers from inconsistent documentation. We propose a two-stage approach. First, the CodeSearchNet dataset construction process was refined to create a specialized dataset from over 17 million code and markdown cells. After structural and semantic filtering, approximately 36,734 high-quality (code, markdown) pairs were extracted. Second, two modeling paradigms, a lightweight CNN-RNN architecture and a few-shot GPT-3.5 architecture, were evaluated with and without metric information. Results show that incorporating code metrics improves the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated documentation, yielding gains of 6% in BLEU-1 and 3% in ROUGE-L F1 for CNN-RNN-based architecture, and 9% in BERTScore F1 for LLM-based architecture. These findings demonstrate that integrating code metrics provides valuable structural context, enhancing automated documentation generation across diverse model families."}

Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature."}

Over the years, various automated tools have been developed to aid in this process. Search-based approaches typically achieve high coverage but produce tests with low readability, whereas large language model (LLM)-based methods generate more human-readable tests but often suffer from low coverage and compilability. While the majority of research efforts have focused on improving test coverage and readability, little attention has been paid to enhancing the robustness of bug detection, particularly in exposing corner cases and vulnerable execution paths. To address this gap, we propose AdverTest, a novel adversarial framework for LLM-powered test case generation. AdverTest comprises two interacting agents: a test case generation agent (T) and a mutant generation agent (M). These agents engage in an adversarial loop, where M persistently creates new mutants \"hacking\" the blind spots of T's current test suite, while T iteratively refines its test cases to \"kill\" the challenging mutants produced by M. This interaction loop is guided by both coverage and mutation scores, enabling the system to co-evolve toward both high test coverage and bug detection capability. Experimental results in the Defects4J dataset show that our approach improves fault detection rates by 8.56% over the best existing LLM-based methods and by 63.30% over EvoSuite, while also improving line and branch coverage."}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning."}

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems."}

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments."}

This paper presents a novel framework for static architecture reconstruction that supports technology-specific analysis modules, called \\emph{extractors}, and supports \\emph{distributed architecture reconstruction} in multi-repo environments. We describe the core design concepts and algorithms that govern how extractors are executed, how data is passed between them, and how their outputs are unified.

When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

It is crucial that developers understand the architecture and how changes to a service affect the overall system, but rapid and independent development of services increases the risk of architectural drift and discourages the creation and maintenance of documentation. Automatic architecture reconstruction can help avoid these issues, but it is difficult to reuse reconstruction code across multiple projects, as all use different combinations of technologies and project-specific conventions. Reconstruction of architecture-level details is further complicated by the tendency to split microservices into separate repositories, preventing a full view of the system from any one codebase. In this paper, we present and evaluate ModARO, an approach to microservice architecture reconstruction that allows writing modular reconstruction code ('extractors') for any technologies and reusing them across different projects, independent of the surrounding technology stack or whether or not the services are split into multiple codebases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by configuring ModARO to reconstruct 10 open source projects, and we validate the usefulness and usability of ModARO against a state-of-the-art baseline in a user study with 8 industry practitioners. Using this approach, developers can assemble or create extractors tailored to their technology stacks and distribute architecture reconstruction across repositories, enabling integration into repository CI/CD pipelines."}

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection.

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution.

The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches."}

The results indicate a high level of proficiency and frequent use of LLMs, with 85% of respondents reporting intermediate or advanced proficiency and 52% using them daily. LLM use concentrates on exploring Scrum practices, with artifacts and events receiving targeted yet uneven support, whereas broader management tasks appear to be adopted more cautiously.

In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners."}

Code and data: https://github.com/amughalbscs16/network-layer-quality-testing", "summary": "Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications."}

While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \\emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision. We theoretically prove the convergence of our DuMeta++, ensuring stability. Experiments on diverse datasets (iSeg-2019, IBIS, OASIS, ADNI) under few-shot settings demonstrate that DuMeta++ outperforms existing methods in cross-age generalization.

We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible.

Mustafa", "Youcheng Sun"], "title": "Specification Vibing for Automated Program Repair", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-driven automated program repair (APR) has advanced rapidly, but most methods remain code-centric: they directly rewrite source code and thereby risk hallucinated, behaviorally inconsistent fixes. This limitation suggests the need for an alternative repair paradigm that relies on a representation more accessible to LLMs than raw code, enabling more accurate understanding, analysis, and alignment during repair. To address this gap, we propose VibeRepair, a specification-centric APR technique that treats repair as behavior-specification repair rather than ad-hoc code editing. VibeRepair first translates buggy code into a structured behavior specification that captures the program's intended runtime behavior, then infers and repairs specification misalignments, and finally synthesizes code strictly guided by the corrected behavior specification. An on-demand reasoning component enriches hard cases with program analysis and historical bug-fix evidence while controlling cost. Across Defects4J and real-world benchmarks and multiple LLMs, VibeRepair demonstrates consistently strong repair effectiveness with a significantly smaller patch space. On Defects4J v1.2, VibeRepair correctly repairs 174 bugs, exceeding the strongest state-of-the-art baseline by 28 bugs, which corresponds to a 19% improvement. On Defects4J v2.0, it repairs 178 bugs, outperforming prior approaches by 33 bugs, representing a 23% improvement. Evaluations on real-world benchmarks collected after the training period of selected LLMs further confirm its effectiveness and generalizability. By centering repair on explicit behavioral intent, VibeRepair reframes APR for the era of \"vibe\" coding: make the behavior sing, and the code will follow."}

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths.

While recent benchmarks evaluate correctness in realistic codebases, they largely treat tasks as independent and do not assess whether agents can reuse experience across related problems. As a result, the ability of agents to accumulate, retrieve, and apply prior experience, as well as the efficiency gains from such reuse, remains difficult to measure. We introduce SWE-ContextBench, a benchmark designed to explicitly evaluate experience reuse in programming agents. Built on SWE-Bench Lite, SWE-ContextBench augments 300 base tasks with 99 related tasks derived from real dependency and reference relationships among GitHub issues and pull requests, forming task sequences with shared context. The benchmark evaluates agents along three complementary dimensions: prediction accuracy, time efficiency, and cost efficiency. Using SWE-ContextBench, we study multiple experience reuse settings, including oracle guided and autonomous retrieval, as well as full execution trajectories and compact summaries. Our results show that correctly selected summarized experience improves resolution accuracy and substantially reduces runtime and token cost, particularly on harder tasks. In contrast, unfiltered or incorrectly selected experience provides limited or negative benefits. These findings highlight the importance of experience representation and retrieval quality, and position SWE-ContextBench as a principled benchmark for studying experience reuse in programming agents."}

For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023.

In practice, missing packages, fragile file paths, version conflicts, or incomplete logic frequently cause analyses to fail, even when materials are shared. This study investigates whether large language models and AI agents can automate the diagnosis and repair of such failures, making computational results easier to reproduce and verify. We evaluate this using a controlled reproducibility testbed built from five fully reproducible R-based social science studies. Realistic failures were injected, ranging from simple issues to complex missing logic, and two automated repair workflows were tested in clean Docker environments. The first workflow is prompt-based, repeatedly querying language models with structured prompts of varying context, while the second uses agent-based systems that inspect files, modify code, and rerun analyses autonomously. Across prompt-based runs, reproduction success ranged from 31-79 percent, with performance strongly influenced by prompt context and error complexity. Complex cases benefited most from additional context. Agent-based workflows performed substantially better, with success rates of 69-96 percent across all complexity levels. These results suggest that automated workflows, especially agent-based systems, can significantly reduce manual effort and improve reproduction success across diverse error types. Unlike prior benchmarks, our testbed isolates post-publication repair under controlled failure modes, allowing direct comparison of prompt-based and agent-based approaches."}

Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks.

This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

As mobile ecosystems evolve, HarmonyOS has emerged as a critical platform requiring robust development tools. Software development for the HarmonyOS ecosystem relies heavily on ArkTS, a statically typed extension of TypeScript. Despite its growing importance, the ecosystem lacks robust tools for automated code repair, primarily due to the absence of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation. To address this gap, we present ArkEval, a unified framework for ArkTS automated repair workflow evaluation and benchmark construction. It provides the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for ArkTS automated program repair. We constructed this benchmark by mining issues from a large-scale official Huawei repository containing over 400 independent ArkTS applications. Through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process, we curated 502 reproducible issues. To ensure testability, we employed a novel LLM-based test generation and voting mechanism involving Claude and other models. Furthermore, we standardized problem statements to facilitate fair evaluation. Finally, we evaluated four state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmark using a retrieval-augmented repair workflow. Our results highlight the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in repairing ArkTS code, paving the way for future research in this low-resource language domain."}

Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations.

To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/."}

Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

We propose and evaluate the LLM-based (GPT-4o) approach \"DeepQuali\", for assessing and improving requirements quality in agile software development. We applied it to projects in two small companies, where we compared LLM-based quality assessments with expert judgments.

Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments. Experts recognized the usefulness of the approach but criticized the lack of integration into their workflow. LLMs show potential in supporting software engineers with the quality assessment and improvement of requirements. The explicit use of quality models and explanatory feedback increases acceptance."}

First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions.

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level.

To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management."}

We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations."}

We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration."}

However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA. Our method achieves unlearning of not only individual concepts but also combinations of concepts and conditional concepts, without any specific regularization."}

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects. Experiments on the MFNet dataset demonstrate that CLARITY establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), achieving 62.3% mIoU and 77.5% mAcc."}

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models."}

To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment."}

First, we test whether LLMs can recover well-established instruments from the literature, assessing their ability to replicate standard reasoning. Second, we evaluate whether LLMs can identify and avoid instruments that have been empirically or theoretically discredited. Building on these results, we introduce IV Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, and refines IVs for a given treatment-outcome pair. We also introduce a statistical test to contextualize consistency in the absence of ground truth.

In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context.

To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing."}

Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings. Overall, SAG offers a scalable solution to digital health that better balances effectiveness, reliability, and deployment efficiency."}

We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes."}

This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations."}

Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use."}

To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%.

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this \"judging the judges\" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased.

The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image.

The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee.

We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems."}

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems."}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction.

In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning."}

Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency."}

By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution."}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies."}

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28.

Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data.

Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions."}

FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation."}

We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer."}

To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off.

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

To address this gap, we propose the \\texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \\texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting."}

Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.\n  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV.

The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs.

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services.

SHARP: Shapley Credit-based Optimization for Multi-Agent System", "comment": null, "summary": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning."}

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics.

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens.

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts.

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1.

First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching.

Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy.

Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility. This dataset and analysis establish a foundational cornerstone for future research to develop truly modality-agnostic medical foundation models."}

Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop.

Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline."}

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks."}

We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient.

We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications.

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy.

We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching. The fused outputs provide robust image-level anomaly scoring and accurate pixel-level localization. Experiments on CoalAD demonstrate that our method outperforms widely used baselines across the evaluated image-level and pixel-level metrics, and ablation studies validate the contribution of each component.

The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation.

We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture.

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation.

Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions.

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations.

We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.\n  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity."}

In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability.

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion.

These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals.

To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS."}

Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller.

We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment.

While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35.

This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.\n  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values."}

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning."}

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

To improve the generalization of the model, we regard different surveillance scenes as different category scenes, and introduce few-shot learning to make the model adapt to the unseen surveillance scene that belongs to the given exemplar category scene. To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting."}

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems.

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging."}

To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively.

Emerging techniques, such as diffusion-based models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), alongside enhancements in traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have contributed to the sophisticated generation of deepfake videos. Concurrently, deepfake detection methods have seen notable progress, driven by innovations in Transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and other machine learning approaches. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods. Our findings highlight a concerning trend: many state-of-the-art detection models exhibit markedly poor performance when challenged with deepfakes produced by modern synthesis techniques, including poor performance by human participants against the best quality deepfakes. Through extensive experimentation, we provide evidence that underscores the urgent need for continued refinement of detection models to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of deepfake generation technologies. This research emphasizes the critical gap between current detection methodologies and the sophistication of new generation techniques, calling for intensified efforts in this crucial area of study."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance."}

To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks.

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics.

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time."}

This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data.

These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures."}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines.

Synthesizing recent interdisciplinary research, the paper identifies key applications of AI in this domain, including automated bug triaging, system maintenance, contributor onboarding and mentorship, community health analytics, vulnerability detection, and task automation. The review also examines the limitations and ethical concerns that arise from applying AI in OSS contexts, including data availability, bias and fairness, transparency, risks of misuse, and the preservation of human-centered values in collaborative development. By framing AI not as a replacement but as a tool to augment human infrastructure, this study highlights both the promise and pitfalls of AI-driven interventions.

In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models. These findings establish DAS-SK as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for real-time agricultural robotics and high-resolution remote sensing, with strong potential for broader deployment in other vision domains."}

This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic. These findings establish internal introspection as a decodable property for verifying generated code. Our code is at https:// github.com/bruno686/CodeCircuit."}

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities."}

Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for code generation [Chen et al., 2021; Huynh and Lin, 2025], their effectiveness in domain-specific enterprise contexts remains underexplored, particularly when both retrieval and modification tasks must be handled jointly. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) variants [Lewis et al., 2021] -- standard RAG, Self-RAG [Asai et al., 2024], and CoRAG [Wang et al., 2025] -- across SQL query generation, REST API call generation, and a combined task requiring dynamic task classification. Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%). Critically, CoRAG proves most robust in hybrid documentation settings, achieving statistically significant improvements in the combined task (10.29% exact match vs. 7.45% for standard RAG), driven primarily by superior SQL generation performance (15.32% vs. 11.56%). Our findings establish retrieval-policy design as a key determinant of production-grade natural language interfaces, showing that iterative query decomposition outperforms both top-k retrieval and binary relevance filtering under documentation heterogeneity."}

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \\textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios.

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set."}

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27).

Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends.

A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot. We show that it supports over 20x faster-than-real-time, end-to-end simulation of a complete development and deployment stack -- including edge compute and networking -- significantly compressing the build-test-release cycle of perception-based autonomy."}

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation.

CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment.

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching."}

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147.

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm.

Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms."}

To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy.

We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts. L-LIO augments driver and scene understanding through multimodal fusion of audio and visual sensing, offering new paths for safety intervention."}

However, thermal imagery often exhibits low texture, low contrast, and high noise, complicating feature-based SLAM. In this work, we propose a sparse monocular graph-based SLAM system for thermal imagery that leverages general-purpose learned features -- the SuperPoint detector and LightGlue matcher, trained on large-scale visible-spectrum data to improve cross-domain generalization. To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches. We further incorporate keypoint confidence scores from SuperPoint into a confidence-weighted factor graph to improve estimation robustness. Evaluations on public thermal datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable performance without requiring dataset-specific training or fine-tuning a desired feature detector, given the scarcity of quality thermal data.

This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types."}

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools.

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods."}

To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer.

Automated Linter Configuration via DSL-Based LLM Compilation of Coding Standards", "comment": "Accepted By FSE2026", "summary": "Coding standards are essential for maintaining consistent and high-quality code across teams and projects. Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters."}

In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.\n  To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks."}

While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches."}

It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes.

In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework.

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions.

Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists."}

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts.

We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation."}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results.

We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios.

However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities."}

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning."}

We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions.

In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively.

A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model.

Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality.

To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors.

Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures.

We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency.

However, the decentralized optimization of SR parameters -- transmission power and Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) -- across different Basic Service Sets (BSSs) is challenging due to the lack of global state information. In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance. These results confirm the not-yet-unleashed potential of scalable decentralized solutions and question the need for the heavy signaling overheads and architectural complexity associated with emerging centralized solutions like Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC)."}

To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\\%. It also outperforms other pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference, making it promising for enhancing the efficiency of transformers."}

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks."}

To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios.

Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential.

Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse.

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead. This hybrid framework presents a robust and efficient solution for high-quality 3D CT image post-processing.

In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations."}

We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\\%.

To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations."}

We propose and evaluate the LLM-based (GPT-4o) approach \"DeepQuali\", for assessing and improving requirements quality in agile software development. We applied it to projects in two small companies, where we compared LLM-based quality assessments with expert judgments. Experts also participated in walkthroughs of the solution, provided feedback, and rated their acceptance of the approach. Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments. Experts recognized the usefulness of the approach but criticized the lack of integration into their workflow.

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits.

A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference.

First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS.

We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies."}

This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation.

To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations.

We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors.

In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures.

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems."}

To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation.
