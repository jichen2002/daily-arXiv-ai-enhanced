Abstract: Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis.

TL;DR: 提出基于归因的人类先验对齐方法，通过约束模型依赖预期证据，提升准确率和决策合理性，验证于图像分类和点击决策任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习仅提供类别级标签，导致模型可能通过捷径相关性而非预期证据实现高准确率。人类先验可约束此类行为，但模型表示常与人类感知不一致，对齐挑战大。

Method: 提出了一种基于归因的人类先验对齐方法，通过输入区域（如边界框）编码人类先验，并利用高保真子集选择归因方法在训练中暴露模型的决策证据。当归因区域偏离先验区域时，惩罚对非先验证据的依赖，促使模型将归因转向预期区域。

Result: 在图像分类和点击决策任务中，人类先验对齐方法不仅提高了任务准确率，还增强了模型决策的合理性。

Conclusion: 通过人类先验对齐方法，模型在保持高准确率的同时，决策合理性得到提升，验证了该方法在图像分类和点击决策任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Reliable models should not only predict correctly, but also justify decisions with acceptable evidence. Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜成像快速、无创且广泛应用，但其大规模分析仍受限于公共多标签数据集的不足和统一分割到量化流程的缺乏。

Method: RetSAM是一个通用的视网膜分割和量化框架，采用多阶段训练策略，结合私有和公共眼底数据，支持多目标分割和标准化生物标志物提取。

Result: RetSAM在17个公共数据集上表现出色，平均DSC提升3.9个百分点，在复杂多任务基准上提升高达15个百分点，并能泛化到不同人群、设备和临床环境。

Conclusion: RetSAM通过将眼底图像转化为标准化的、可解释的定量表型，支持大规模眼科研究和转化应用。

Abstract: Retinal imaging is fast, non-invasive, and widely available, offering quantifiable structural and vascular signals for ophthalmic and systemic health assessment. This accessibility creates an opportunity to study how quantitative retinal phenotypes relate to ocular and systemic diseases. However, such analyses remain difficult at scale due to the limited availability of public multi-label datasets and the lack of a unified segmentation-to-quantification pipeline. We present RetSAM, a general retinal segmentation and quantification framework for fundus imaging. It delivers robust multi-target segmentation and standardized biomarker extraction, supporting downstream ophthalmologic studies and oculomics correlation analyses. Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings. The resulting biomarkers enable systematic correlation analyses across major ophthalmic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and pathologic myopia. Together, RetSAM transforms fundus images into standardized, interpretable quantitative phenotypes, enabling large-scale ophthalmic research and translation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拒绝策略多为“一刀切”，无法适应多样化的用户需求和上下文约束，导致拒绝不足或过度拒绝。

Method: CR-VLM 包含三个集成组件：通过教师强制机制提取可配置拒绝向量以增强拒绝信号；引入门控机制以减轻过度拒绝；设计反事实视觉增强模块以对齐视觉表示与拒绝需求。

Result: 在多个数据集和各种视觉语言模型上的综合实验表明，CR-VLM 实现了有效、高效且鲁棒的可配置拒绝。

Conclusion: CR-VLM 提供了一种可扩展的路径，实现了在视觉语言模型中用户自适应的安全对齐，通过实验证明了其有效性、高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs), refusal mechanisms have become a critical component for ensuring responsible and safe model behavior. However, existing refusal strategies are largely \textit{one-size-fits-all} and fail to adapt to diverse user needs and contextual constraints, leading to either under-refusal or over-refusal. In this work, we firstly explore the challenges mentioned above and develop \textbf{C}onfigurable \textbf{R}efusal in \textbf{VLM}s (\textbf{CR-VLM}), a robust and efficient approach for {\em configurable} refusal based on activation steering. CR-VLM consists of three integrated components: (1) extracting a configurable refusal vector via a teacher-forced mechanism to amplify the refusal signal; (2) introducing a gating mechanism that mitigates over-refusal by preserving acceptance for in-scope queries; and (3) designing a counterfactual vision enhancement module that aligns visual representations with refusal requirements. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various VLMs demonstrate that CR-VLM achieves effective, efficient, and robust configurable refusals, offering a scalable path toward user-adaptive safety alignment in VLMs.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) powers cross-border e-commerce product listings; existing research focuses on machine translation evaluation, while visual rendering quality is critical for user engagement. When facing context-dense product imagery and multimodal defects, current reference-based methods (e.g., SSIM, FID) lack explainability, while model-as-judge approaches lack domain-grounded, fine-grained reward signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance. The dataset and model will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate currency recognition is essential for assistive technologies, particularly for visually impaired individuals who rely on others to identify banknotes. This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC. Additionally, explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are incorporated to enhance transparency and interpretability.

Abstract: Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability.

Conclusion: 理论上驱动的表示约束为将自监督学习原理与实际的结构从运动流程结合提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, particularly when images originate from multiple unrelated scenes and contain significant visual ambiguity. The Image Matching Challenge 2025 (IMC2025) highlights these difficulties by requiring both scene discovery and camera pose estimation under real-world conditions, including outliers and mixed content. This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines.

Conclusion: XAI-CLIP通过整合多模态视觉语言模型嵌入，显著提升了医学图像分割的解释性和效率，为临床部署提供了透明且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical component of clinical workflows, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.

Abstract: Creating photorealistic materials for 3D rendering requires exceptional artistic skill. Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a "virtual gonioreflectometer" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions. The resulting materials exhibit realism and diversity far exceeding the limited synthetic training data, demonstrating that material knowledge can be successfully transferred from internet-scale video models into standalone, reusable neural 3D assets.

Abstract: Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, often resulting in loss of life, severe aircraft damage, and substantial financial costs. Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.

Abstract: We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.
  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.
  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 研究通过分析VLMs的几何表征，发现概念向量的重叠与错误模式相关，为理解模型行为提供了量化框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型在多对象视觉任务中的失败机制，如幻觉非存在元素或无法识别相似对象。

Method: 通过分析开放权重视觉语言模型（Qwen、InternVL、Gemma）的表征几何，提取“概念向量”并验证其有效性。

Result: 概念向量的几何重叠与特定错误模式强相关，通过干预可可靠地操纵模型行为。

Conclusion: 几何重叠的概念向量与特定错误模式强相关，为理解内部表征如何塑造模型行为及驱动视觉失败提供了定量的框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit puzzling failures in multi-object visual tasks, such as hallucinating non-existent elements or failing to identify the most similar objects among distractions. While these errors mirror human cognitive constraints, such as the "Binding Problem", the internal mechanisms driving them in artificial systems remain poorly understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill "concept vectors" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures.

Result: 实验证明PEGAsus能有效提取广泛参考形状的属性，并灵活组合文本生成新形状，支持细粒度控制和跨类别应用，定量和定性评估均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PEGAsus框架通过几何和外观层面的渐进优化策略，能够有效提取和组合形状属性，支持细粒度控制和多样化、个性化的3D形状生成，在跨类别场景中表现优异，优于现有最先进解决方案。

Abstract: We present PEGAsus, a new framework capable of generating Personalized 3D shapes by learning shape concepts at both Geometry and Appearance levels. First, we formulate 3D shape personalization as extracting reusable, category-agnostic geometric and appearance attributes from reference shapes, and composing these attributes with text to generate novel shapes. Second, we design a progressive optimization strategy to learn shape concepts at both the geometry and appearance levels, decoupling the shape concept learning process. Third, we extend our approach to region-wise concept learning, enabling flexible concept extraction, with context-aware and context-free losses. Extensive experimental results show that PEGAsus is able to effectively extract attributes from a wide range of reference shapes and then flexibly compose these concepts with text to synthesize new shapes. This enables fine-grained control over shape generation and supports the creation of diverse, personalized results, even in challenging cross-category scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReAlign and ReVision to address the Modality Gap, enabling efficient scaling of MLLMs using unpaired data instead of expensive image-text pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the Modality Gap, a geometric anomaly where embeddings of distinct modalities expressing identical semantics occupy systematically offset regions, which prior approaches oversimplified.

Method: The paper introduces ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy, and ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for MLLMs. ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process (Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment), while ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates efficient model scaling by leveraging unpaired data, eliminating the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively replace expensive image-text pairs, providing a robust method for efficiently scaling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Abstract: Despite the success of multimodal contrastive learning in aligning visual and linguistic representations, a persistent geometric anomaly, the Modality Gap, remains: embeddings of distinct modalities expressing identical semantics occupy systematically offset regions. Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIBR4D是一种无学习的4D高斯分割框架，通过两阶段迭代边界细化（IGIT和RCC）及时间分割策略，显著提升了动态场景中对象分割的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态4D高斯场景中的对象级分割因复杂运动、遮挡和模糊边界而具有挑战性，现有的一刀切阈值方法难以处理遮挡和保持对象结构的完整性。

Method: 论文提出了一种无学习的4D高斯分割框架TIBR4D，包含两个核心阶段：1）迭代高斯实例追踪（IGIT），通过迭代追踪逐步细化高斯到实例的概率；2）帧间高斯渲染范围控制（RCC），通过抑制边界附近高不确定性的高斯点来提升边界准确性。此外，还引入了时间分割合并策略以平衡身份一致性和动态感知。

Result: 在HyperNeRF和Neu3D数据集上的实验表明，相比现有方法，TIBR4D能生成边界更清晰、效率更高的对象高斯点云。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的TIBR4D框架通过两阶段迭代边界细化（IGIT和RCC）及时间分割合并策略，显著提升了动态4D高斯场景中对象级分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Object-level segmentation in dynamic 4D Gaussian scenes remains challenging due to complex motion, occlusions, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods.

TL;DR: FCL通过公平约束和增强探索，避免熵最小化，显著提升分布偏移下的零样本识别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有基于提示的TTA方法因熵最小化而放大虚假相关性和过度自信错误的问题，提出FCL框架以显式解决共享证据偏差。

Method: FCL采用两阶段适应策略：(1) 基于增强的探索识别候选类别，(2) 公平驱动的校准调整文本上下文以平衡对共同视觉证据的敏感性。

Result: FCL在多样化的域偏移和细粒度基准测试中表现出与最先进TTA方法相当的适应性能。

Conclusion: FCL框架通过公平驱动的校准和增强探索，有效解决了共享证据偏差问题，提升了在分布偏移下的零样本识别性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP enable strong zero-shot recognition but suffer substantial degradation under distribution shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反渲染方法在反照率估计中存在颜色和阴影不准确的问题，RotLight旨在通过简单的捕捉设置解决这一模糊性。

Method: 提出了RotLight捕捉设置，仅需物体在过程中旋转几次，并结合2DGS反渲染方法引入代理网格，以改进入射光追踪和全局光照处理。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持高效计算的同时，实现了更优的反照率估计。

Conclusion: RotLight方法通过简单的旋转捕捉设置和引入代理网格，有效减少了反渲染中的模糊性，提高了反照率估计的准确性，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to decompose a scene into its geometry, material properties and light conditions under a certain rendering model. It has wide applications like view synthesis, relighting, and scene editing. In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation.

*Kaaustaaub Shankar,Bharadwaj Dogga,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANFIS增强的CNN在特定架构中提升对抗鲁棒性，但效果因模型而异，并非普遍有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管卷积神经网络（CNN）在图像分类中表现优异，但缺乏可解释性且易受对抗攻击。神经模糊混合模型（如DCNFIS）通过引入自适应神经模糊推理系统（ANFIS）提升可解释性，但其鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 本研究比较了标准CNN（ConvNet、VGG、ResNet18）与其ANFIS增强版本在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的表现，测试了基于梯度（PGD）和无梯度（Square）攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: ANFIS集成并未一致提升干净准确率，且对鲁棒性的影响因架构而异：ResNet18-ANFIS表现出更强的对抗鲁棒性，而VGG-ANFIS通常不如其基线模型。

Conclusion: 神经模糊增强（如ANFIS）在特定架构（如ResNet18）中可以提升对抗鲁棒性，但并非普遍适用，其效果依赖于具体架构。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve strong image classification performance but lack interpretability and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neuro-fuzzy hybrids such as DCNFIS replace fully connected CNN classifiers with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to improve interpretability, yet their robustness remains underexplored. This work compares standard CNNs (ConvNet, VGG, ResNet18) with their ANFIS-augmented counterparts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under gradient-based (PGD) and gradient-free (Square) attacks. Results show that ANFIS integration does not consistently improve clean accuracy and has architecture-dependent effects on robustness: ResNet18-ANFIS exhibits improved adversarial robustness, while VGG-ANFIS often underperforms its baseline. These findings suggest that neuro-fuzzy augmentation can enhance robustness in specific architectures but is not universally beneficial.

Motivation: 由于现实世界文档在布局结构、视觉质量和任务特定信息需求上的巨大差异，KIE 任务仍然具有挑战性。研究旨在通过 UNIKIE-BENCH 全面系统地评估 LMMs 的 KIE 能力。

Method: 研究引入了 UNIKIE-BENCH，一个包含两个互补轨道的统一基准测试：一个受约束类别的 KIE 轨道和一个开放类别的 KIE 轨道，用于评估 LMMs 的 KIE 能力。

Result: 对 15 种最先进的 LMMs 的实验表明，在多样化的模式定义、长尾关键字段和复杂布局下，性能显著下降，且不同文档类型和场景之间存在明显的性能差异。

Conclusion: UNIKIE-BENCH 基准测试揭示了大型多模态模型（LMMs）在关键信息提取（KIE）任务中面临的持续挑战，尤其是在布局感知推理和准确性方面。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from real-world documents remains challenging due to substantial variations in layout structures, visual quality, and task-specific information requirements. Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios. These findings underscore persistent challenges in grounding accuracy and layout-aware reasoning for LMM-based KIE. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/UNIKIE-BENCH.

Motivation: 现有AI诊断方法仅视为视觉模式识别任务，未反映牙科专业人员的结构化临床推理，且需大量专家标注数据，难以在多样化现实影像条件下泛化。

Method: OMNI-Dent采用多视角智能手机照片，嵌入牙科专家的诊断启发式方法，并利用通用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行牙齿级评估，无需针对牙科进行特定微调。

Result: OMNI-Dent能在缺乏临床影像资源的场景下支持诊断评估，帮助用户识别潜在异常并判断是否需要专业评估。

Conclusion: OMNI-Dent框架通过结合临床推理原则和视觉语言模型，为缺乏专业口腔医疗资源的用户提供了一种高效、可解释的早期辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Accurate dental diagnosis is essential for oral healthcare, yet many individuals lack access to timely professional evaluation. Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care.

Result: 在OpenOOD和文档数据集上，COMBOOD优于现有方法，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: COMBOOD框架在远OOD和近OOD场景下均表现出色，显著提升了检测准确率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) data at inference time is crucial for many machine learning applications, especially for automation. We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications.

Abstract: Pipeline integrity is critical to industrial safety and environmental protection, with Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) detection being a primary non-destructive testing technology. Despite the promise of deep learning for automating MFL interpretation, progress toward reliable models has been constrained by the absence of a large-scale public dataset and benchmark, making fair comparison and reproducible evaluation difficult. We introduce \textbf{PipeMFL-240K}, a large-scale, meticulously annotated dataset and benchmark for complex object detection in pipeline MFL pseudo-color images. PipeMFL-240K reflects real-world inspection complexity and poses several unique challenges: (i) an extremely long-tailed distribution over \textbf{12} categories, (ii) a high prevalence of tiny objects that often comprise only a handful of pixels, and (iii) substantial intra-class variability. The dataset contains \textbf{240,320} images and \textbf{191,530} high-quality bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately \textbf{1,480} km. Extensive experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art object detectors to establish baselines. Results show that modern detectors still struggle with the intrinsic properties of MFL data, highlighting considerable headroom for improvement, while PipeMFL-240K provides a reliable and challenging testbed to drive future research. As the first public dataset and the first benchmark of this scale and scope for pipeline MFL inspection, it provides a critical foundation for efficient pipeline diagnostics as well as maintenance planning and is expected to accelerate algorithmic innovation and reproducible research in MFL-based pipeline integrity assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled complex reasoning. However, existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks remain heavily biased toward perception tasks, such as object recognition and scene classification. This limitation hinders the development of MLLMs for cognitively demanding RS applications. To address this, , we propose a Vision Language ReaSoning Benchmark (VLRS-Bench), which is the first benchmark exclusively dedicated to complex RS reasoning. Structured across the three core dimensions of Cognition, Decision, and Prediction, VLRS-Bench comprises 2,000 question-answer pairs with an average length of 71 words, spanning 14 tasks and up to eight temporal phases. VLRS-Bench is constructed via a specialized pipeline that integrates RS-specific priors and expert knowledge to ensure geospatial realism and reasoning complexity. Experimental results reveal significant bottlenecks in existing state-of-the-art MLLMs, providing critical insights for advancing multimodal reasoning within the remote sensing community.

Abstract: Pixel-level feature attributions are an important tool in eXplainable AI for Computer Vision (XCV), providing visual insights into how image features influence model predictions. The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.

Abstract: Online handwriting recognition using inertial measurement units opens up handwriting on paper as input for digital devices. Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.

TL;DR: 研究发现视频模型采用分布式而非分解的物理变量表示，足以进行物理预测，物理信息在特定中间层（物理涌现区）变得可访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视频模型是否需要依赖物理变量的分解表示来进行准确的物理预测，或者它们是否可以在任务特定的分布式方式中隐含地表示这些变量。

Method: 通过分层探测、子空间几何、补丁级解码和目标注意力消融等方法，研究了视频编码器中的物理表示。

Result: 在架构中识别出一个称为“物理涌现区”的中间深度过渡，物理变量在此变得可访问。物理相关表示在此过渡后不久达到峰值，并在输出层逐渐退化。标量（如速度和加速度）从早期层开始就可访问，而运动方向仅在物理涌现区变得可访问。方向通过具有圆形几何结构的高维群体结构编码。

Conclusion: 现代视频模型并未使用像经典物理引擎那样分解的物理变量表示，而是采用了一种分布式表示，这种表示足以进行物理预测。

Abstract: A long-standing question in physical reasoning is whether video-based models need to rely on factorized representations of physical variables in order to make physically accurate predictions, or whether they can implicitly represent such variables in a task-specific, distributed manner. While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.
  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.

TL;DR: Neural Sentinel通过统一视觉语言模型实现高效车牌识别和多任务处理，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ALPR系统采用多阶段流水线，导致错误累积、延迟增加和架构复杂。研究旨在通过统一方法解决这些问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种名为Neural Sentinel的统一方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）通过单次前向传递完成车牌识别、状态分类和车辆属性提取。采用经过LoRA微调的PaliGemma 3B模型，并引入人机交互（HITL）持续学习框架，通过经验回放防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: Neural Sentinel在车牌识别准确率上达到92.3%，比EasyOCR和PaddleOCR分别提升14.1%和9.9%。系统平均推理延迟为152ms，ECE为0.048，并在零样本任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 统一视觉语言方法（如Neural Sentinel）代表了ALPR系统的范式转变，提供了更高的准确性、降低的架构复杂性以及传统流水线方法无法实现的突发多任务能力。

Abstract: Traditional Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems employ multi-stage pipelines consisting of object detection networks followed by separate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules, introducing compounding errors, increased latency, and architectural complexity. This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neuronavigation systems rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. This study aims to address these limitations by developing a markerless approach.

Method: The study introduces low-cost visible and infrared light cameras with stereo and depth sensing, combined with algorithmic modeling of facial geometry, to replace traditional marker-based systems.

Result: Validation with 50 human subjects showed a median tracking discrepancy of only 2.32 mm and 2.01° for the best markerless algorithms, indicating sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results.

Conclusion: The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Neuronavigation is widely used in biomedical research and interventions to guide the precise placement of instruments around the head to support procedures such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Traditional systems, however, rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further. The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Urban design profoundly impacts public spaces and community engagement. Traditional top-down methods often overlook public input, creating a gap in design aspirations and reality. Recent advancements in digital tools, like City Information Modelling and augmented reality, have enabled a more participatory process involving more stakeholders in urban design. Further, deep learning and latent diffusion models have lowered barriers for design generation, providing even more opportunities for participatory urban design. Combining state-of-the-art latent diffusion models with interactive semantic segmentation, we propose RECITYGEN, a novel tool that allows users to interactively create variational street view images of urban environments using text prompts. In a pilot project in Beijing, users employed RECITYGEN to suggest improvements for an ongoing Urban Regeneration project. Despite some limitations, RECITYGEN has shown significant potential in aligning with public preferences, indicating a shift towards more dynamic and inclusive urban planning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据保护法规和负责任 AI 实践的要求增加，机器遗忘成为必要能力，但文本到图像扩散模型中的遗忘仍面临高计算成本和平衡遗忘与保留的挑战。

Method: FADE 采用两阶段遗忘方法，结合参数定位与自蒸馏技术，通过梯度显著性识别遗忘集相关参数，并使用稀疏 LoRA 适配器进行轻量级局部修改。

Result: 在 UnlearnCanvas 基准测试及多个数据集上的实验表明，FADE 实现了最先进的遗忘性能，并精细控制了遗忘与保留的权衡。

Conclusion: FADE 是一种适用于扩散基图像生成模型的选择性遗忘解决方案，能够在各种领域中实现强概念擦除和高保留性。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data or concepts from trained models while preserving overall performance, a capability increasingly required by data protection regulations and responsible AI practices. Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，非金属夹杂物（污染）的比例由检查员视觉判断，这种方法因粉尘和移动机械而具有主观性和危险性。

Method: 该方法将污染评估制定为铁路车辆级别的回归任务，并通过多实例学习（MIL）和多任务学习（MTL）利用序列数据。

Result: 最佳结果包括MIL的MAE 0.27和R2 0.83；MTL设置达到MAE 0.36，废料类别的F1为0.79。

Conclusion: 该管道减少了主观判断的变异性，提高了人员安全性，并能够整合到验收和熔炼计划工作流程中。

Abstract: Scrap quality directly affects energy use, emissions, and safety in steelmaking. Today, the share of non-metallic inclusions (contamination) is judged visually by inspectors - an approach that is subjective and hazardous due to dust and moving machinery. We present an assistive computer vision pipeline that estimates contamination (per percent) from images captured during railcar unloading and also classifies scrap type. The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL). Best results include MAE 0.27 and R2 0.83 by MIL; and an MTL setup reaches MAE 0.36 with F1 0.79 for scrap class. Also we present the system in near real time within the acceptance workflow: magnet/railcar detection segments temporal layers, a versioned inference service produces railcar-level estimates with confidence scores, and results are reviewed by operators with structured overrides; corrections and uncertain cases feed an active-learning loop for continual improvement. The pipeline reduces subjective variability, improves human safety, and enables integration into acceptance and melt-planning workflows.

Conclusion: OmniFysics展示了在统一多模态理解方面的竞争力，尤其在物理导向评估中表现更优。

Abstract: Physical understanding remains brittle in omni-modal models because key physical attributes are visually ambiguous and sparsely represented in web-scale data. We present OmniFysics, a compact omni-modal model that unifies understanding across images, audio, video, and text, with integrated speech and image generation. To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting. FysicsOmniCap distills web videos via audio--visual consistency filtering to generate high-fidelity video--instruction pairs emphasizing cross-modal physical cues. We train OmniFysics with staged multimodal alignment and instruction tuning, adopt latent-space flow matching for text-to-image generation, and use an intent router to activate generation only when needed. Experiments show competitive performance on standard multimodal benchmarks and improved results on physics-oriented evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无接触、非侵入性地从光学观测中估计物理介质的机械性质，适用于无法进行直接物理测量的工程和生物医学应用。

Method: 采用两个深度神经网络分别进行图像配准和材料压缩性估计，构建了一个高效的端到端框架。

Result: 深度学习模型在效率和准确性上均优于传统方法，即使在图像配准预测的映射与参考位移场存在显著局部偏差时，仍能准确估计材料压缩性。

Conclusion: 深度学习端到端模型通过评估高阶认知特征（如矢量场的涡度）而非传统的图像位移局部特征，实现了对材料压缩性的高精度估计。

Abstract: Contactless and non-invasive estimation of mechanical properties of physical media from optical observations is of interest for manifold engineering and biomedical applications, where direct physical measurements are not possible. Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement.

Motivation: 解决基于扩散的超分辨率模型在合成数据上训练后，因分布偏移而无法适应真实世界LR图像的问题。

Method: 提出Bird-SR框架，结合合成LR-HR对和真实LR图像，通过奖励反馈学习（ReFL）进行轨迹级偏好优化。早期扩散步骤直接优化合成对以保持结构，后期采样步骤应用质量引导奖励。采用动态保真度-感知权重策略平衡结构学习和感知优化。

Conclusion: Bird-SR通过双向奖励引导的扩散框架，结合合成和真实LR图像，在保持结构一致性的同时提升感知质量，有效解决了真实世界超分辨率问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution can synthesize rich details, but models trained on synthetic paired data often fail on real-world LR images due to distribution shifts. We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution.

Conclusion: MosaicThinker技术显著提升了资源受限的具身AI设备在跨帧空间推理任务中的准确性。

Abstract: When embodied AI is expanding from traditional object detection and recognition to more advanced tasks of robot manipulation and actuation planning, visual spatial reasoning from the video inputs is necessary to perceive the spatial relationships of objects and guide device actions. However, existing visual language models (VLMs) have very weak capabilities in spatial reasoning due to the lack of knowledge about 3D spatial information, especially when the reasoning task involve complex spatial relations across multiple video frames. In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks. Our basic idea is to integrate fragmented spatial information from multiple frames into a unified space representation of global semantic map, and further guide the VLM's spatial reasoning over the semantic map via a visual prompt. Experiment results show that our technique can greatly enhance the accuracy of cross-frame spatial reasoning on resource-constrained embodied AI devices, over reasoning tasks with diverse types and complexities.

Conclusion: WorldEdit数据集和两阶段训练框架显著缩小了与GPT-4o和Nano-Banana的差距，在指令遵循和知识合理性方面表现出竞争力。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing explicit instructions, such as attribute manipulation, style transfer, and pose synthesis. However, these models often face challenges when dealing with implicit editing instructions, which describe the cause of a visual change without explicitly detailing the resulting outcome. These limitations arise because existing models rely on uniform editing strategies that are not equipped to handle the complex world knowledge and reasoning required for implicit instructions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward. Our results show that the proposed dataset and methods significantly narrow the gap with GPT-4o and Nano-Banana, demonstrating competitive performance not only in instruction following but also in knowledge plausibility, where many open-source systems typically struggle.

Abstract: Automated floorplan generation aims to improve design quality, architectural efficiency, and sustainability by jointly modeling global spatial organization and precise geometric detail. However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on RPLAN dataset (FID = 1.84, MSE = 2.06) and leading results on LIFULL dataset. The proposed framework advances constraint-aware and scalable vector floorplan generation for real-world architectural applications.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的端到端强化学习框架，结合可重光照的3D高斯泼溅技术，显著提升了无人机在非结构化户外环境中的导航能力，尤其是在动态光照条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: UAV navigation in unstructured outdoor environments using passive monocular vision is hindered by the substantial visual domain gap between simulation and reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PI3D作为一种针对3D环境中多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的提示注入攻击方法，通过物理对象放置而非数字图像编辑实现攻击，实验证明其有效性，且现有防御措施不足以抵御此类攻击。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced the capabilities to interpret and act on visual input in 3D environments, empowering diverse applications such as robotics and situated conversational agents. When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D.

Motivation: 尽管语音与 3D 面部动画对自然交互至关重要，但现有 OLLMs 在这方面的研究仍不足。主要挑战在于 LLMs 的离散、令牌级语义推理与 3D 面部动作所需的密集、细粒度时间动态之间的表示不匹配。

Conclusion: Ex-Omni 框架通过解耦语义推理与时间生成，利用语音单元作为时间支架和统一的 TQGF 机制，成功实现了稳定的语音和 3D 面部动画生成，性能与现有开源 OLLMs 竞争。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的兴起导致大规模互联网数据集的使用增加，但缺乏数据整理可能包含敏感或私人信息，尤其是妊娠超声图像这类敏感信息。

Method: 通过CLIP嵌入相似性对LAION-400M数据集进行系统检查，检索包含妊娠超声的图像并检测数千条私人信息实体（如姓名和位置）。

Result: 研究发现多个图像包含高风险信息，可能导致重新识别或冒充。

Conclusion: 论文建议了数据集整理、数据隐私和公共图像数据集伦理使用的最佳实践。

Abstract: The rise of generative models has led to increased use of large-scale datasets collected from the internet, often with minimal or no data curation. This raises concerns about the inclusion of sensitive or private information. In this work, we explore the presence of pregnancy ultrasound images, which contain sensitive personal information and are often shared online. Through a systematic examination of LAION-400M dataset using CLIP embedding similarity, we retrieve images containing pregnancy ultrasound and detect thousands of entities of private information such as names and locations. Our findings reveal that multiple images have high-risk information that could enable re-identification or impersonation. We conclude with recommended practices for dataset curation, data privacy, and ethical use of public image datasets.

Conclusion: DuMeta++通过双元学习框架和内存库正则化策略，无需配对纵向数据即可实现跨年龄的脑组织分割，实验证明其在少样本设置下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tissues from MRI scans is critical for neuroscience and clinical applications, but achieving consistent performance across the human lifespan remains challenging due to dynamic, age-related changes in brain appearance and morphology. While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision. We theoretically prove the convergence of our DuMeta++, ensuring stability. Experiments on diverse datasets (iSeg-2019, IBIS, OASIS, ADNI) under few-shot settings demonstrate that DuMeta++ outperforms existing methods in cross-age generalization. Code will be available at https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/DuMeta++.

Motivation: 现有的交通基准缺乏与官方安全标准一致的系统性评估，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 通过从大量多样的真实世界视频数据集中提取并系统化组织，RoadSafe365提供了一个支持细粒度交通安全分析的视觉-语言基准。它采用分层分类法，扩展了事故、事件和违规的基础定义，并与官方交通安全标准对齐。

Conclusion: RoadSafe365被设计为一个大规模、标准化的评估基准，旨在推动现实世界交通安全分析的可重复研究，并通过跨领域实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Although recent traffic benchmarks have advanced multimodal data analysis, they generally lack systematic evaluation aligned with official safety standards. To fill this gap, we introduce RoadSafe365, a large-scale vision-language benchmark that supports fine-grained analysis of traffic safety from extensive and diverse real-world video data collections. Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice question-answer sets, comprising 864K candidate options, 8.4K unique answers, and 36K detailed scene descriptions collectively designed for vision-language understanding and reasoning. We establish strong baselines and observe consistent gains when fine-tuning on RoadSafe365. Cross-domain experiments on both real and synthetic datasets further validate its effectiveness. Designed for large-scale training and standardized evaluation, RoadSafe365 provides a comprehensive benchmark to advance reproducible research in real-world traffic safety analysis.

Motivation: 探索数据驱动SR模型作为成像管道预处理步骤时引入的未研究攻击面。

Method: 通过联合优化重建质量和目标对抗结果，AdvSR在训练阶段直接嵌入对抗行为，无需推理时输入访问。

Result: AdvSR在三种SR架构（SRCNN、EDSR、SwinIR）与YOLOv11分类器配对中，实现了高攻击成功率且质量退化最小。

Conclusion: AdvSR框架揭示了SR模型权重中嵌入对抗行为的新威胁，强调了在安全关键应用中模型来源和验证的重要性。

Abstract: Data-driven super-resolution (SR) methods are often integrated into imaging pipelines as preprocessing steps to improve downstream tasks such as classification and detection. However, these SR models introduce a previously unexplored attack surface into imaging pipelines. In this paper, we present AdvSR, a framework demonstrating that adversarial behavior can be embedded directly into SR model weights during training, requiring no access to inputs at inference time. Unlike prior attacks that perturb inputs or rely on backdoor triggers, AdvSR operates entirely at the model level. By jointly optimizing for reconstruction quality and targeted adversarial outcomes, AdvSR produces models that appear benign under standard image quality metrics while inducing downstream misclassification. We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation. These findings highlight a new model-level threat for imaging pipelines, with implications for how practitioners source and validate models in safety-critical applications.

Method: 3D-TBM框架包括数据预处理、最优运输嵌入计算以及分析方法，如可视化主要运输方向、识别区分方向等。

Result: 3D-TBM能够有效地进行分类、回归等任务，并通过逆向映射将分析结果投影回原始图像空间，实现空间上有意义的临床特征解释。

Conclusion: 3D-TBM工具通过提供全面的文档和实践教程，支持研究人员在医学影像研究中应用基于运输的形态测量方法，其源代码已通过PyTransKit公开。

Abstract: Transport-Based Morphometry (TBM) has emerged as a new framework for 3D medical image analysis. By embedding images into a transport domain via invertible transformations, TBM facilitates effective classification, regression, and other tasks using transport-domain features. Crucially, the inverse mapping enables the projection of analytic results back into the original image space, allowing researchers to directly interpret clinical features associated with model outputs in a spatially meaningful way. To facilitate broader adoption of TBM in clinical imaging research, we present 3D-TBM, a tool designed for morphological analysis of 3D medical images. The framework includes data preprocessing, computation of optimal transport embeddings, and analytical methods such as visualization of main transport directions, together with techniques for discerning discriminating directions and related analysis methods. We also provide comprehensive documentation and practical tutorials to support researchers interested in applying 3D-TBM in their own medical imaging studies. The source code is publicly available through PyTransKit.

TL;DR: TwistNet-2D提出一种轻量级局部通道交互模块STCI，通过方向性空间位移增强纹理识别，性能优于现有大模型且计算开销极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉纹理特征时存在全局通道相关性丢失空间结构或空间上下文依赖加权聚合而非显式特征交互的问题，TwistNet-2D旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: TwistNet-2D采用Spiral-Twisted Channel Interaction（STCI）模块，通过方向性空间位移计算局部通道乘积，结合四个方向头和学习通道重加权，以极低的计算开销增强特征交互。

Result: TwistNet-2D在四个纹理和细粒度识别基准测试中，仅增加3.5%参数和2%计算量，即超越包括ConvNeXt、Swin Transformer等在内的多种基线模型。

Conclusion: TwistNet-2D通过轻量级的局部通道交互模块STCI，显著提升了纹理识别性能，超越了现有参数匹配和更大规模的基线模型。

Abstract: Second-order feature statistics are central to texture recognition, yet current methods face a fundamental tension: bilinear pooling and Gram matrices capture global channel correlations but collapse spatial structure, while self-attention models spatial context through weighted aggregation rather than explicit pairwise feature interactions. We introduce TwistNet-2D, a lightweight module that computes \emph{local} pairwise channel products under directional spatial displacement, jointly encoding where features co-occur and how they interact. The core component, Spiral-Twisted Channel Interaction (STCI), shifts one feature map along a prescribed direction before element-wise channel multiplication, thereby capturing the cross-position co-occurrence patterns characteristic of structured and periodic textures. Aggregating four directional heads with learned channel reweighting and injecting the result through a sigmoid-gated residual path, \TwistNet incurs only 3.5% additional parameters and 2% additional FLOPs over ResNet-18, yet consistently surpasses both parameter-matched and substantially larger baselines -- including ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and hybrid CNN--Transformer architectures -- across four texture and fine-grained recognition benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有世界模型通常仅从单一视角（通常是自我中心视角）操作，而多视角（如鸟瞰视角）可能使规划（如导航）更高效。

Method: 引入跨视角预测目标：给定一个视角的帧序列，预测同一或不同视角在采取行动后的未来状态。利用Aimlabs平台的多视角游戏数据进行训练。

Result: 模型能够提供跨视角的并行想象流，支持在不同参考框架中进行规划，同时从自我中心视角执行。多视角一致性为空间基础表示提供了强大的学习信号。

Conclusion: 跨视角世界模型（XVWM）通过多视角一致性学习提供了空间基础表示，为多智能体环境中的视角转换奠定了基础。

Abstract: World models enable agents to plan by imagining future states, but existing approaches operate from a single viewpoint, typically egocentric, even when other perspectives would make planning easier; navigation, for instance, benefits from a bird's-eye view. We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings.

TL;DR: An Attention-DeepLab model enhances DR lesion segmentation, boosting detection accuracy, especially for microaneurysms, aiding early diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of DR is vital to prevent vision loss, but existing deep learning-based algorithms lack clinical applicability in lesion segmentation. This work aims to provide pixel-level annotations to support ophthalmologists in DR screening.

Method: The study integrates an attention mechanism with DeepLab-V3+ to segment four types of DR-related lesions (microaneurysms, soft exudates, hard exudates, hemorrhages) on 757 images from the DDR dataset.

Result: The Attention-DeepLab model improved mean average precision (mAP) from 0.3010 to 0.3326 and mean Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.1791 to 0.1928. Microaneurysm detection notably increased from 0.0205 to 0.0763.

Conclusion: The Attention-DeepLab model significantly improves lesion segmentation in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, particularly enhancing microaneurysm detection, which is crucial for early DR diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease which arises due to diabetes mellitus. It might cause vision loss and blindness. To prevent irreversible vision loss, early detection through systematic screening is crucial. Although researchers have developed numerous automated deep learning-based algorithms for DR screening, their clinical applicability remains limited, particularly in lesion segmentation. Our method provides pixel-level annotations for lesions, which practically supports Ophthalmologist to screen DR from fundus images. In this work, we segmented four types of DR-related lesions: microaneurysms, soft exudates, hard exudates, and hemorrhages on 757 images from DDR dataset. To enhance lesion segmentation, an attention mechanism was integrated with DeepLab-V3+. Compared to the baseline model, the Attention-DeepLab model increases mean average precision (mAP) from 0.3010 to 0.3326 and the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.1791 to 0.1928. The model also increased microaneurysm detection from 0.0205 to 0.0763, a clinically significant improvement. The detection of microaneurysms is the earliest visible symptom of DR.

Conclusion: 该研究通过优化的过滤和分割算法，显著提升了铌基铜合金在增材制造中的迭代速度，为聚变反应堆部件的材料开发提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Current analysis of additive manufactured niobium-based copper alloys relies on hand annotation due to varying contrast, noise, and image artifacts present in micrographs, slowing iteration speed in alloy development. We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts.

Result: LUCID产生了可解释的共享特征，支持补丁级接地，建立跨模态神经元对应，并增强了对基于相似性评估中的概念聚类问题的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LUCID通过共享潜在字典和模态特定细节的保留，提供了一种可解释的多模态表示方法，其共享特征捕捉了包括对象、动作、属性和抽象概念在内的多样化语义类别。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a natural path toward comparable explanations across different representation spaces. However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations.

Motivation: 现有RGB-热融合方法采用静态策略，导致模态特定噪声传播，无法适应不同光照条件。

Method: 提出CLARITY方法，动态调整融合策略以适应不同光照条件，利用视觉语言模型先验调制各模态贡献，并引入两种机制：保留有效暗物体语义和分层解码器以增强结构一致性。

Result: 在MFNet数据集上达到62.3% mIoU和77.5% mAcc，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: CLARITY通过动态融合策略和视觉语言模型先验，成功提升了在恶劣光照条件下的语义分割性能，并在MFNet数据集上达到了新的SOTA。

Abstract: Robust semantic segmentation of road scenes under adverse illumination, lighting, and shadow conditions remain a core challenge for autonomous driving applications. RGB-Thermal fusion is a standard approach, yet existing methods apply static fusion strategies uniformly across all conditions, allowing modality-specific noise to propagate throughout the network. Hence, we propose CLARITY that dynamically adapts its fusion strategy to the detected scene condition. Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects. Experiments on the MFNet dataset demonstrate that CLARITY establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), achieving 62.3% mIoU and 77.5% mAcc.

Motivation: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)在Forbidden Zones区域稳定性不足，因真实教师提供不可靠指导而假教师施加的排斥力不足。

Method: 提出Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD)，一种自校正机制，利用奖励代理明确检测并逃离Forbidden Zones，通过结构信号分解动态优先校正梯度，并引入Repulsive Landscape Sharpening以增强对失败模式崩溃的能量屏障。

Result: AMD在图像和视频生成任务（如SDXL、Wan2.1）及严格基准测试（如VBench、GenEval）中显著提升样本保真度和训练鲁棒性，例如将SDXL的HPSv2分数从30.64提高到31.25，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: AMD通过明确纠正Forbidden Zones内的优化轨迹，显著提升了少步生成模型的性能上限。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a powerful acceleration paradigm, yet its stability is often compromised in Forbidden Zone, regions where the real teacher provides unreliable guidance while the fake teacher exerts insufficient repulsive force. In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为RCSA的模块，结合改进的U-Net结构，有效利用全局信息指导局部信息，减少了参数和计算量，并在低光照图像/视频增强任务中表现出色。

Abstract: U-Net structure is widely used for low-light image/video enhancement. The enhanced images result in areas with large local noise and loss of more details without proper guidance for global information. Attention mechanisms can better focus on and use global information. However, attention to images could significantly increase the number of parameters and computations. We propose a Row-Column Separated Attention module (RCSA) inserted after an improved U-Net. The RCSA module's input is the mean and maximum of the row and column of the feature map, which utilizes global information to guide local information with fewer parameters. We propose two temporal loss functions to apply the method to low-light video enhancement and maintain temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the LOL, MIT Adobe FiveK image, and SDSD video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cq-dong/URCSA.

Abstract: We address the problem of reconstructing 3D surfaces from depth and surface normal maps acquired by a sensor system based on a single perspective camera. Depth and normal maps can be obtained through techniques such as structured-light scanning and photometric stereo, respectively. We propose a perspective-aware log-depth fusion approach that extends existing orthographic gradient-based depth-normals fusion methods by explicitly accounting for perspective projection, leading to metrically accurate 3D reconstructions. Additionally, the method handles missing depth measurements by leveraging available surface normal information to inpaint gaps. Experiments on the DiLiGenT-MV data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of perspective-aware depth-normals fusion.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) digitization-converting paper-based or scanned ECG images back into time-series signals-is critical for leveraging decades of legacy clinical data in modern deep learning applications. However, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets providing both ECG images and their corresponding ground truth signals with comprehensive annotations. We introduce PTB-XL-Image-17K, a complete synthetic ECG image dataset comprising 17,271 high-quality 12-lead ECG images generated from the PTB-XL signal database. Our dataset uniquely provides five complementary data types per sample: (1) realistic ECG images with authentic grid patterns and annotations (50% with visible grid, 50% without), (2) pixel-level segmentation masks, (3) ground truth time-series signals, (4) bounding box annotations in YOLO format for both lead regions and lead name labels, and (5) comprehensive metadata including visual parameters and patient information. We present an open-source Python framework enabling customizable dataset generation with controllable parameters including paper speed (25/50 mm/s), voltage scale (5/10 mm/mV), sampling rate (500 Hz), grid appearance (4 colors), and waveform characteristics. The dataset achieves 100% generation success rate with an average processing time of 1.35 seconds per sample. PTB-XL-Image-17K addresses critical gaps in ECG digitization research by providing the first large-scale resource supporting the complete pipeline: lead detection, waveform segmentation, and signal extraction with full ground truth for rigorous evaluation. The dataset, generation framework, and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/naqchoalimehdi/PTB-XL-Image-17K and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18197519.

Conclusion: SoulX-FlashHead 通过 Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training 和 Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation 技术，实现了高保真视觉质量与低延迟流式传输的平衡，并在 HDTF 和 VFHQ 基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Achieving a balance between high-fidelity visual quality and low-latency streaming remains a formidable challenge in audio-driven portrait generation. Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks. Notably, our Lite variant achieves an inference speed of 96 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, facilitating ultra-fast interaction without sacrificing visual coherence.

Motivation: 现有评估器存在'注意力崩溃'问题，导致跨图像比较和细粒度细节捕捉不足，评分不准确。

Method: 提出SpatialReward奖励模型，通过显式空间推理进行精确验证，并在260k空间感知数据集上训练。

Result: 在MMRB2和EditReward-Bench上达到最先进性能，在MultiEditReward-Bench上优于专有评估器，并在在线RL中提升OmniGen2性能。

Conclusion: 空间推理对于实现图像编辑中的有效对齐至关重要，SpatialReward通过像素级证据显著提升了评估准确性。

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for complex image editing but is currently constrained by the scarcity of reliable and fine-grained reward signals. Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term "Attention Collapse," where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45). These results demonstrate that spatial reasoning is essential for unlocking effective alignment in image editing.

Conclusion: GWD档案提供了一个统一、高质量的数据集，支持开发稳健且可泛化的废物识别模型，促进环境监测和回收自动化等领域的ML应用。

Abstract: The growing amount of waste is a problem for the environment that requires efficient sorting techniques for various kinds of waste. An automated waste classification system is used for this purpose. The effectiveness of these Artificial Intelligence (AI) models depends on the quality and accessibility of publicly available datasets, which provide the basis for training and analyzing classification algorithms. Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability. Overall, this dataset offers a strong foundation for Machine Learning (ML) applications in environmental monitoring, recycling automation, and waste identification, and is publicly available to promote future research and reproducibility.

Conclusion: TOM-GS是一种结合学习型里程计与高斯泼溅技术的热成像里程计与建图方法，其在运动估计和新视角渲染方面表现优于现有学习型方法，验证了学习型流程在鲁棒热成像里程计和密集重建中的优势。

Abstract: Thermal infrared sensors, with wavelengths longer than smoke particles, can capture imagery independent of darkness, dust, and smoke. This robustness has made them increasingly valuable for motion estimation and environmental perception in robotics, particularly in adverse conditions. Existing thermal odometry and mapping approaches, however, are predominantly geometric and often fail across diverse datasets while lacking the ability to produce dense maps. Motivated by the efficiency and high-quality reconstruction ability of recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) techniques, we propose TOM-GS, a thermal odometry and mapping method that integrates learning-based odometry with GS-based dense mapping. TOM-GS is among the first GS-based SLAM systems tailored for thermal cameras, featuring dedicated thermal image enhancement and monocular depth integration. Extensive experiments on motion estimation and novel-view rendering demonstrate that TOM-GS outperforms existing learning-based methods, confirming the benefits of learning-based pipelines for robust thermal odometry and dense reconstruction.

Abstract: Decoding visual representations from brain signals has attracted significant attention in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, the degree to which brain signals truly encode visual information remains unclear. Current visual decoding approaches explore various brain-image alignment strategies, yet most emphasize high-level semantic features while neglecting pixel-level details, thereby limiting our understanding of the human visual system. In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a Fusion Prior, which learns a stable mapping on large-scale visual data and subsequently matches brain features to this pre-trained prior, thereby enhancing distributional consistency across modalities. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between retrieval accuracy and reconstruction fidelity.

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has markedly advanced character animation, which synthesizes motioned videos by animating a static identity image according to a driving video. Explicit methods represent motion using skeleton, DWPose or other explicit structured signals, but struggle to handle spatial mismatches and varying body scales. %proportions. Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel implicit motion representation that compresses per-frame motion into compact 1D motion tokens. This design relaxes strict spatial constraints inherent in 2D representations and effectively prevents identity information leakage from the motion video. Furthermore, we design a temporally consistent mask token-based retargeting module that enforces a temporal training bottleneck, mitigating interference from the source images' motion and improving retargeting consistency. Our methodology employs a three-stage training strategy to enhance the training efficiency and ensure high fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our implicit motion representation and the propose IM-Animation's generative capabilities are achieve superior or competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 无人机图像中的前景物体通常较小且稀疏，这阻碍了有效物体检测器的优化，因此需要自适应放大物体以更好地捕捉特征。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的偏移预测方案和基于框的放大目标，用于学习输入图像的非均匀放大，并设计了角对齐的边界框变换方法，用于在放大空间中进行训练和推理。

Result: 在VisDrone、UAVDT和SeaDronesSee数据集上进行了广泛实验，ZoomDet显著提升了检测性能（如SeaDronesSee上mAP提升8.4），且仅增加约3ms延迟。

Conclusion: ZoomDet是一个架构无关的自适应放大框架，通过非均匀放大和边界框变换方法显著提升了无人机图像中的小物体检测性能，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Detecting objects from UAV-captured images is challenging due to the small object size. In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

Abstract: In modern complex environments, achieving accurate and efficient target localization is essential in numerous fields. However, existing systems often face limitations in both accuracy and the ability to recognize small targets. In this study, we propose a bionic stabilized localization system based on CA-YOLO, designed to enhance both target localization accuracy and small target recognition capabilities. Acting as the "brain" of the system, the target detection algorithm emulates the visual focusing mechanism of animals by integrating bionic modules into the YOLO backbone network. These modules include the introduction of a small target detection head and the development of a Characteristic Fusion Attention Mechanism (CFAM). Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), a bionic pan-tilt tracking control strategy is developed, which incorporates central positioning, stability optimization, adaptive control coefficient adjustment, and an intelligent recapture function. The experimental results show that CA-YOLO outperforms the original model on standard datasets (COCO and VisDrone), with average accuracy metrics improved by 3.94%and 4.90%, respectively.Further time-sensitive target localization experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of this bionic stabilized localization system.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个统一的评估任务和指标，以联合评估对象中心学习（OCL）模型的定位和表示有用性，解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn structured scene representations that support compositional generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. However, OCL models are often not evaluated regarding these goals. Instead, most prior work focuses on evaluating OCL models solely through object discovery and simple reasoning tasks, such as probing the representation via image classification. We identify two limitations in existing benchmarks: (1) They provide limited insights on the representation usefulness of OCL models, and (2) localization and representation usefulness are assessed using disjoint metrics. To address (1), we use instruction-tuned VLMs as evaluators, enabling scalable benchmarking across diverse VQA datasets to measure how well VLMs leverage OCL representations for complex reasoning tasks. To address (2), we introduce a unified evaluation task and metric that jointly assess localization (where) and representation usefulness (what), thereby eliminating inconsistencies introduced by disjoint evaluation. Finally, we include a simple multi-feature reconstruction baseline as a reference point.

Conclusion: 编码器衍生的特征流形反映了潜在的组织表型和状态转换，为基于影像的卒中演变量化提供了见解。

Abstract: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) at admission is routinely used to estimate the ischemic core and penumbra, while follow-up diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) provides the definitive infarct outcome. However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉-语言预训练方法依赖全局或局部对齐，但全局对齐易受非诊断信息干扰，局部对齐难以整合关键诊断证据，导致在配对数据有限的情况下难以学习可靠的诊断表示。

Method: 提出LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment (LGDEA)方法，利用LLM从放射学报告中提取关键诊断证据，构建共享诊断证据空间，实现证据感知的跨模态对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，LGDEA在短语定位、图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务上均取得显著提升，且在配对数据有限的情况下性能接近依赖大量配对数据的方法。

Conclusion: LGDEA方法通过证据级别的对齐显著提升了医学视觉-语言预训练的性能，甚至在有限配对数据的情况下也能与依赖大量配对数据的方法相媲美。

Abstract: Most existing CLIP-style medical vision--language pretraining methods rely on global or local alignment with substantial paired data. However, global alignment is easily dominated by non-diagnostic information, while local alignment fails to integrate key diagnostic evidence. As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data.

Conclusion: MUFASA通过多层级特征融合策略显著提升了无监督物体中心学习的分割性能，同时仅带来轻微推理开销。

Abstract: Unsupervised object-centric learning (OCL) decomposes visual scenes into distinct entities. Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation. Our model computes slot attention across multiple feature layers of the ViT encoder, fully leveraging their semantic richness. We propose a fusion strategy to aggregate slots obtained on multiple layers into a unified object-centric representation. Integrating MUFASA into existing OCL methods improves their segmentation results across multiple datasets, setting a new state of the art while simultaneously improving training convergence with only minor inference overhead.

Conclusion: 研究发现，DINOv3的最后一层特征作为基线表现优异，揭示了基础模型中存在的'语义选择鸿沟'，即传统启发式方法难以可靠识别高保真特征。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv3, provide rich feature representations for dense vision tasks. This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a "Safest vs. Optimal" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a "Semantic Selection Gap" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features. Our work establishes the "Last-Layer" as a deceptively strong baseline and provides a rigorous diagnostic of the latent semantic potentials in DINOv3.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hussni0997/fssdino.

Result: 在IBench上的实验表明，FlexID在身份一致性和文本遵循方面达到了最先进的平衡。

Conclusion: FlexID通过正交解耦身份特征和引入上下文感知自适应门控机制，在保持身份一致性和文本适应性之间实现了最佳平衡，为复杂叙事生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to seamlessly integrate specific identities into textual descriptions. However, existing training-free methods often rely on rigid visual feature injection, creating a conflict between identity fidelity and textual adaptability. To address this, we propose FlexID, a novel training-free framework utilizing intent-aware modulation. FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种紧凑的3B参数视觉-语言-动作（VLA）代理，通过显式的图像基础推理，提升了可解释性、泛化能力和导航效率。

Abstract: Language-driven object navigation requires agents to interpret natural language descriptions of target objects, which combine intrinsic and extrinsic attributes for instance recognition and commonsense navigation. Existing methods either (i) use end-to-end trained models with vision-language embeddings, which struggle to generalize beyond training data and lack action-level explainability, or (ii) rely on modular zero-shot pipelines with large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detectors, which suffer from error propagation, high computational cost, and difficulty integrating their reasoning back into the navigation policy. To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer "Is this the target object?" and "Why should I take this action?" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: "think", "think summary", and "action", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

Motivation: 现有统一模型如Bagel虽能对齐多个视觉任务，但仅限于单条件输入，缺乏多源异构输入的灵活性。

Method: SIGMA是一个后训练框架，通过选择性多属性令牌（如风格、内容、主题和身份令牌）在扩散变压器中实现多条件生成。

Result: 实验表明，SIGMA在多样编辑和生成任务中提升了控制性、跨条件一致性和视觉质量，尤其在组合任务上显著优于Bagel。

Conclusion: SIGMA通过引入选择性多属性令牌和后训练，显著提升了扩散变压器在多条件生成任务中的控制性、跨条件一致性和视觉质量，优于现有模型Bagel。

Abstract: Recent unified models such as Bagel demonstrate that paired image-edit data can effectively align multiple visual tasks within a single diffusion transformer. However, these models remain limited to single-condition inputs and lack the flexibility needed to synthesize results from multiple heterogeneous sources. We present SIGMA (Selective-Interleaved Generation with Multi-Attribute Tokens), a unified post-training framework that enables interleaved multi-condition generation within diffusion transformers. SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks.

Abstract: Human identification at a distance (HID) is challenging because traditional biometric modalities such as face and fingerprints are often difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Gait recognition provides a practical alternative, as it can be captured reliably at a distance. To promote progress in gait recognition and provide a fair evaluation platform, the International Competition on Human Identification at a Distance (HID) has been organized annually since 2020. Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization. While HID 2023 and HID 2024 already used this dataset, HID 2025 explicitly examined whether algorithmic advances could surpass the accuracy limits observed previously. Despite the heightened difficulty, participants achieved further improvements, and the best-performing method reached 94.2% accuracy, setting a new benchmark on this dataset. We also analyze key technical trends and outline potential directions for future research in gait recognition.

Abstract: Precise identification of individual cows is a fundamental prerequisite for comprehensive digital management in smart livestock farming. While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments.

Method: MammoColor结合了轻量级的TDCE模块和BI-RADS分类器，并在VinDr-Mammo数据集上进行了端到端训练。

Result: 在VinDr-Mammo数据集上，MammoColor将AUC从0.7669提升至0.8461（P=0.004），在致密乳腺组织中提升更明显（AUC 0.749至0.835）。MRMC研究中，TDCE编码图像提高了特异性（0.90至0.96；P=0.052），同时保持敏感性。

Conclusion: TDCE提供了一种任务优化的色彩表示方法，可能提高乳腺X光检查的感知显著性并减少假阳性召回。

Abstract: Purpose:Mammography screening is less sensitive in dense breasts, where tissue overlap and subtle findings increase perceptual difficulty. We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity. Conclusion:TDCE provides a task-optimized chromatic representation that may improve perceptual salience and reduce false-positive recalls in mammography triage.

Conclusion: ViCA 是一种高效的 MLLM 架构，通过稀疏跨注意力机制显著降低了视觉计算开销，同时保持了基线性能的 98%，并在硬件友好的推理流程中实现了显著的加速。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adopt a unified self-attention design that processes visual and textual tokens at every Transformer layer, incurring substantial computational overhead. In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

Abstract: This paper presents a geology-driven machine learning method for automated rock joint trace mapping from images. The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.

Abstract: Post-training is the decisive step for converting a pretrained video generator into a production-oriented model that is instruction-following, controllable, and robust over long temporal horizons. This report presents a systematical post-training framework that organizes supervised policy shaping, reward-driven reinforcement learning, and preference-based refinement into a single stability-constrained optimization stack. The framework is designed around practical video-generation constraints, including high rollout cost, temporally compounding failure modes, and feedback that is heterogeneous, uncertain, and often weakly discriminative. By treating optimization as a staged, diagnostic-driven process rather than a collection of isolated tricks, the report summarizes a cohesive recipe for improving perceptual fidelity, temporal coherence, and prompt adherence while preserving the controllability established at initialization. The resulting framework provides a clear blueprint for building scalable post-training pipelines that remain stable, extensible, and effective in real-world deployment settings.

Abstract: Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of "visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Motivation: 转移进展是癌症相关死亡的主要原因，但直接从组织病理学预测原发肿瘤是否会转移及其扩散部位仍是一个基本挑战。

Method: 提出了一个决策感知、概念对齐的多实例学习框架HistoMet，采用两模块预测流程：首先估计原发肿瘤转移进展的可能性，随后对高风险病例进行转移部位的预测。

Result: 在临床高灵敏度筛查设置下（95%灵敏度），HistoMet显著减少下游工作量，同时保持高转移风险召回率。对于转移病例，HistoMet的宏F1为74.6，标准差为1.3，宏一对多AUC为92.1。

Conclusion: 显式建模临床决策结构能够直接从原发肿瘤组织病理学中实现对转移进展和部位趋向性的稳健且可部署的预后预测。

Abstract: Metastatic Progression remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, yet predicting whether a primary tumor will metastasize and where it will disseminate directly from histopathology remains a fundamental challenge. Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology.

Method: AD-MIR采用两阶段架构：1. 结构感知记忆构建阶段，通过语义检索与精确关键词匹配将原始视频转换为结构化数据库；2. 结构化推理代理阶段，模仿营销专家通过迭代查询循环分解叙事并推断隐含说服策略，同时采用基于证据的自我校正机制。

Conclusion: AD-MIR框架通过两阶段架构（结构化记忆构建和结构化推理代理）成功解码广告意图，证明了将抽象营销策略明确基于像素级证据的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of advertising videos is essential for interpreting the intricate relationship between visual storytelling and abstract persuasion strategies. However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

Abstract: While emerging 3D medical foundation models are envisioned as versatile tools with offer general-purpose capabilities, their validation remains largely confined to regional and structural imaging, leaving a significant modality discrepancy unexplored. To provide a rigorous and objective assessment, we curate the UMD dataset comprising 490 whole-body PET/CT and 464 whole-body PET/MRI scans ($\sim$675k 2D images, $\sim$12k 3D organ annotations) and conduct a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of representative 3D segmentation foundation models. Through intra-subject controlled comparisons of paired scans, we isolate imaging modality as the primary independent variable to evaluate model robustness in real-world applications. Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility. This dataset and analysis establish a foundational cornerstone for future research to develop truly modality-agnostic medical foundation models.

TL;DR: Images2Slides系统将静态信息图转换为可编辑Google Slides，通过VLM和API实现高恢复率和布局保真度，并探讨了工程挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态信息图内容锁定为像素后更新、本地化和重用成本高昂的问题。

Method: 通过基于API的管道，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）提取区域级规范，将像素几何映射到幻灯片坐标，并使用Google Slides批量更新API重新创建元素。

Result: 在29个程序生成的信息图基准测试中，元素恢复率为0.989±0.057，文本转录错误率CER=0.033±0.149，布局保真度IoU为0.364±0.161（文本区域）和0.644±0.131（图像区域）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种将静态信息图转换为可编辑Google Slides的系统，展示了高元素恢复率和布局保真度，同时指出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Infographics are widely used to communicate information with a combination of text, icons, and data visualizations, but once exported as images their content is locked into pixels, making updates, localization, and reuse expensive. We describe \textsc{Images2Slides}, an API-based pipeline that converts a static infographic (PNG/JPG) into a native, editable Google Slides slide by extracting a region-level specification with a vision-language model (VLM), mapping pixel geometry into slide coordinates, and recreating elements using the Google Slides batch update API. The system is model-agnostic and supports multiple VLM backends via a common JSON region schema and deterministic postprocessing. On a controlled benchmark of 29 programmatically generated infographic slides with known ground-truth regions, \textsc{Images2Slides} achieves an overall element recovery rate of $0.989\pm0.057$ (text: $0.985\pm0.083$, images: $1.000\pm0.000$), with mean text transcription error $\mathrm{CER}=0.033\pm0.149$ and mean layout fidelity $\mathrm{IoU}=0.364\pm0.161$ for text regions and $0.644\pm0.131$ for image regions. We also highlight practical engineering challenges in reconstruction, including text size calibration and non-uniform backgrounds, and describe failure modes that guide future work.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了3D模型重建流程中的误差，发现Otsu方法最适用，但AAA因壁薄和对齐问题表现较差。表面和体素指标趋势不同，Jaccard指数更适合薄壁结构评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是探索几何类型、类别不平衡、体素和点云对齐对3D模型重建准确性的影响，这些因素尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 本研究评估了重建流程中的误差，并探索了不同分割算法和几何类型的体素和表面为基础的准确性指标。使用SLA技术打印了球体、面罩和AAA，并通过微CT机器扫描。使用GMM、Otsu和RG方法进行分割。分割后的模型与参考模型通过KU算法对齐，并定量比较了Dice和Jaccard分数、精确度等指标。表面网格通过ICP对齐过程与参考网格注册，评估了Chamfer距离和平均Hausdorff距离等指标。

Result: 结果表明，Otsu方法对所有几何类型最适用。AAA由于壁薄和对齐问题导致重叠分数较低。类别不平衡对AAA的特异性影响最大。表面为基础的准确性指标与体素为基础的趋势不同。RG方法在球体上表现最佳，而GMM和Otsu在AAA上表现更好。面罩表面误差最多，可能是由于ICP过程中的对齐问题。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，分割准确性是重建过程中不同阶段误差的累积总和。高体素为基础的准确性指标在类别不平衡和对齐敏感的情况下可能具有误导性。Jaccard指数比Dice更严格，更适合用于薄壁结构的准确性评估。体素和点云对齐必须确保，才能对重建流程进行可靠评估。

Abstract: The accuracy of the 3D models created from medical scans depends on imaging hardware, segmentation methods and mesh processing techniques etc. The effects of geometry type, class imbalance, voxel and point cloud alignment on accuracy remain to be thoroughly explored. This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频模态作为额外信息来源，能更全面地理解驾驶员、乘客及车辆外部人员状态，提升车辆安全。

Method: 扩展了LILO框架，引入音频信号形成L-LIO，通过多模态传感器融合评估驾驶员状态和环境理解。

Result: 初步结果表明，音频在复杂或情境丰富的场景中提供安全相关见解，尤其在视觉信号不足时。

Conclusion: L-LIO框架通过融合音频和视觉感知，增强了驾驶员和场景理解，为安全干预提供了新途径。

Abstract: The looking-in-looking-out (LILO) framework has enabled intelligent vehicle applications that understand both the outside scene and the driver state to improve safety outcomes, with examples in smart airbag deployment, takeover time prediction in autonomous control transitions, and driver attention monitoring. In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., "turn after that red building") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts. L-LIO augments driver and scene understanding through multimodal fusion of audio and visual sensing, offering new paths for safety intervention.

TL;DR: VLMs enhance autonomous driving safety by detecting hazards, integrating embeddings, and using language constraints, but require careful design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how vision-language representations can support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making in autonomous driving by integrating them into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines.

Method: The paper investigates three use cases: a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach using CLIP-based image-text similarity; integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework; and using natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning.

Result: The hazard screening approach robustly detects diverse hazards without explicit object detection. Global embeddings did not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the need for task-aligned representation extraction. Natural language constraints improved safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: Vision-language representations show significant promise for enhancing autonomous driving safety by expressing semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints, but require careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要长时间、多步骤的推理，但现有方法难以处理长且嘈杂的观察数据。

Method: PoT框架将视频推理分解为轻量级、可验证的步骤，包括时间证据选择、逐步状态更新和受限答案合成。

Result: 实验表明，PoT在标准视频推理任务中提高了事实正确性和时间定位能力。

Conclusion: PoT框架通过显式结构化推理过程，显著提升了视频理解任务的事实准确性和时间定位能力，并提供了可解释的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only recognizing visual content but also performing temporally grounded, multi-step reasoning over long and noisy observations. We propose Process-of-Thought (PoT) Reasoning for Videos, a framework that makes the reasoning process explicit by structuring video inference into a sequence of lightweight, verifiable steps. PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools. We further introduce a unified representation for PoT traces that aligns intermediate decisions with temporal segments, which improves robustness to distractors and reduces hallucinated explanations. Extensive experiments on standard video reasoning tasks demonstrate that PoT consistently improves factual correctness and temporal grounding, while providing interpretable reasoning traces for diagnosis and downstream use.

Motivation: 由于煤炭场景的高度非结构化环境（如随机堆放的煤和矸石、复杂多变的背景、低对比度的异物等），现有异常检测方法性能显著下降，因此需要一种新的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种互补线索协作感知框架，从对象级语义组成建模、基于语义属性的全局偏差分析和细粒度纹理匹配三个角度提取并融合互补异常证据。

Result: 在CoalAD基准测试中，该方法在图像级和像素级指标上均优于广泛使用的基线方法，消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的互补线索协作感知框架在煤炭场景中的异物异常检测和像素级定位任务上表现优异，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Reliable foreign-object anomaly detection and pixel-level localization in conveyor-belt coal scenes are essential for safe and intelligent mining operations. This task is particularly challenging due to the highly unstructured environment: coal and gangue are randomly piled, backgrounds are complex and variable, and foreign objects often exhibit low contrast, deformation, occlusion, resulting in coupling with their surroundings. These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes. We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching. The fused outputs provide robust image-level anomaly scoring and accurate pixel-level localization. Experiments on CoalAD demonstrate that our method outperforms widely used baselines across the evaluated image-level and pixel-level metrics, and ablation studies validate the contribution of each component.

Motivation: 医学图像分割在诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但由于医学图像的复杂性和变异性，尤其是数据中的非线性关系，仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种名为U-KABS的混合框架，整合了卷积和挤压激励阶段以增强通道特征表示，以及KAN Bernstein Spline（KABS）阶段，采用基于Bernstein多项式和B-splines的可学习激活函数。

Result: 在多种医学图像基准数据集上的评估表明，U-KABS相比强基线表现出更优的性能，特别是在复杂解剖结构的分割上。

Conclusion: U-KABS模型通过结合Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）和U型编码器-解码器架构，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能，尤其在复杂解剖结构的划分上表现优异。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of medical images, especially in capturing non-linear relationships within the data. We propose U-KABS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates the expressive power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture to enhance segmentation performance. The U-KABS model combines the convolutional and squeeze-and-excitation stage, which enhances channel-wise feature representations, and the KAN Bernstein Spline (KABS) stage, which employs learnable activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials and B-splines. This hybrid design leverages the global smoothness of Bernstein polynomials and the local adaptability of B-splines, enabling the model to effectively capture both broad contextual trends and fine-grained patterns critical for delineating complex structures in medical images. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers support effective multi-scale feature fusion and preserve spatial details. Evaluated across diverse medical imaging benchmark datasets, U-KABS demonstrates superior performance compared to strong baselines, particularly in segmenting complex anatomical structures.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation and lane detection are crucial tasks in autonomous driving systems. Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的统一框架通过结合动态占用网格地图和轻量级时空骨干网络，显著提升了驾驶场景预测的准确性，特别是在动态车辆和通用动态场景元素的预测上表现优于基线方法。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving scene is a challenging task due to uncertainty in sensor data, the complex behaviors of agents, and the possibility of multiple feasible futures. Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 研究训练时长有限导致的训练-测试差距（尤其是在超出训练时长时的开放测试场景），并寻求无需训练的解决方案。

Method: 通过系统分析AR缓存维护，提出了Rolling Sink方法，基于Self Forcing（仅训练5秒片段）在测试时实现超长持续时间的AR视频合成。

Result: Rolling Sink在测试时实现了超长持续时间的AR视频合成，保持了主题一致、颜色稳定、结构连贯和运动平滑，视觉保真度和时间一致性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Rolling Sink作为一种无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了AR视频扩散模型在超长持续时间（如5-30分钟）下的视觉保真度和时间一致性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: ForecastOcc框架在多个数据集上表现优于现有基线方法，能够生成语义丰富且未来感知的预测，为自动驾驶提供了关键的场景动态和语义信息。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires forecasting both geometry and semantics over time to effectively reason about future environment states. Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: UCATSC通过显式模型和硬约束预测，在提高交通延迟和排放的同时，防止安全关键错误，并提供可解释的控制策略输出。

Abstract: Real-world deployment of adaptive traffic signal control, to date, remains limited due to the uncertainty associated with vision-based perception, implicit safety, and non-interpretable control policies learned and validated mainly in simulation. In this paper, we introduce UCATSC, a model-based traffic signal control system that models traffic signal control at an intersection using a stochastic decision process with constraints and under partial observability, taking into account the uncertainty associated with vision-based perception. Unlike reinforcement learning methods that learn to predict safety using reward shaping, UCATSC predicts and enforces hard constraints related to safety and starvation prevention during counterfactual rollouts in belief space.

*Xihang Yu,Rajat Talak,Lorenzo Shaikewitz,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Picasso提出了一种物理约束的多物体场景重建方法，显著提升了物理合理性和人类直觉对齐，并在新数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遮挡和测量噪声存在的情况下，几何准确的场景重建可能物理上不正确，导致物体穿透或不稳定平衡，影响数字孪生的动态行为预测。

Method: Picasso是一个物理约束的重建管道，通过考虑几何、非穿透性和物理来构建多物体场景重建。它依赖于一种快速拒绝采样方法，利用推断的物体接触图来指导样本。

Result: Picasso在新引入的数据集和YCB-V数据集上表现优异，提供了物理上合理的重建。

Conclusion: Picasso显著优于现有技术，提供了物理上合理且更符合人类直觉的重建结果。

Abstract: In the presence of occlusions and measurement noise, geometrically accurate scene reconstructions -- which fit the sensor data -- can still be physically incorrect. For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.

Conclusion: VideoTemp-o3 是一个统一的代理视频思考框架，通过联合建模视频定位和问答，显著提升了长视频理解和定位的性能。

Abstract: In long-video understanding, conventional uniform frame sampling often fails to capture key visual evidence, leading to degraded performance and increased hallucinations. To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding.

Abstract: Accurately predicting pedestrian motion is crucial for safe and reliable autonomous driving in complex urban environments. In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 研究评估了16种AI生成图像检测器的零样本性能，发现无通用最佳检测器，性能差异显著，并提供了针对具体威胁场景选择检测器的实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像在数字平台的泛滥，可靠的检测方法对于打击错误信息和维护内容真实性变得至关重要。现有基准主要评估微调模型，忽视了即开即用性能这一最常见的部署场景。

Method: 首次对16种最先进的检测方法进行了全面的零样本评估，包括23个预训练检测器变体，覆盖12个多样化数据集，共260万张图像样本，涵盖291种生成器。

Result: 研究发现：（1）没有通用的最佳检测器，检测器排名存在显著不稳定性；（2）最佳与最差检测器间存在37个百分点的性能差距；（3）训练数据对齐对泛化影响巨大，导致架构相同检测器家族内20-60%的性能差异；（4）现代商业生成器（如Flux Dev、Firefly v4、Midjourney v7）击败大多数检测器，平均准确率仅18-30%；（5）识别出三种影响跨数据集泛化的系统性失败模式。统计证实检测器间性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了'一刀切'的检测器范式，并提供了实用的部署指南，表明从业者需要根据具体威胁场景而非公布的基准性能来谨慎选择检测器。

Abstract: As AI-generated images proliferate across digital platforms, reliable detection methods have become critical for combating misinformation and maintaining content authenticity. While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate fine-tuned models, leaving a critical gap in understanding out-of-the-box performance -- the most common deployment scenario for practitioners. We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models. Our systematic analysis reveals striking findings: (1)~no universal winner exists, with detector rankings exhibiting substantial instability (Spearman~$ρ$: 0.01 -- 0.87 across dataset pairs); (2)~a 37~percentage-point performance gap separates the best detector (75.0\% mean accuracy) from the worst (37.5\%); (3)~training data alignment critically impacts generalization, causing up to 20--60\% performance variance within architecturally identical detector families; (4)~modern commercial generators (Flux~Dev, Firefly~v4, Midjourney~v7) defeat most detectors, achieving only 18--30\% average accuracy; and (5)~we identify three systematic failure patterns affecting cross-dataset generalization. Statistical analysis confirms significant performance differences between detectors (Friedman test: $χ^2$=121.01, $p<10^{-16}$, Kendall~$W$=0.524). Our findings challenge the ``one-size-fits-all'' detector paradigm and provide actionable deployment guidelines, demonstrating that practitioners must carefully select detectors based on their specific threat landscape rather than relying on published benchmark performance.

Motivation: 当前对具身世界模型的评估主要关注感知保真度，忽视了其在决策任务中的功能效用，因此需要统一的评估框架。

Method: 通过视频感知质量（16个指标）和具身任务功能（作为数据引擎、策略评估器和动作规划器）三个维度评估模型，并提出EWMScore作为综合指标。

Result: 实验揭示了感知与功能之间的显著差距，表明高视觉质量并不一定转化为强大的具身任务能力。

Conclusion: WorldArena提供了一个统一的基准，系统地评估了具身世界模型在感知和功能维度上的表现，并揭示了感知与功能之间的显著差距。

Abstract: While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://worldarena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.

TL;DR: 零样本视觉语言模型在面部年龄估计中显著优于专用模型，建议将研究方向转向VLM能力蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部年龄估计在内容审核、年龄验证和深度伪造检测中至关重要，但此前缺乏对现代视觉语言模型与专用年龄估计架构的系统性比较。

Method: 论文提出了第一个大规模跨范式基准测试，评估了34个模型（22个专用架构和12个通用VLM）在8个标准数据集上的表现。

Result: 关键发现是零样本VLM显著优于大多数专用模型，平均MAE为5.65年（非LLM模型为9.88年）。最佳VLM（Gemini 3 Flash Preview，MAE 4.32）比最佳非LLM模型（MiVOLO，MAE 5.10）表现优15%。

Conclusion: 论文结论挑战了任务特定架构在年龄估计中的必要性，并建议将研究方向转向将视觉语言模型（VLM）能力蒸馏到高效专用模型中。

Abstract: Facial age estimation is critical for content moderation, age verification, and deepfake detection, yet no prior benchmark has systematically compared modern vision-language models (VLMs) against specialized age estimation architectures. We present the first large-scale cross-paradigm benchmark, evaluating \textbf{34 models} -- 22 specialized architectures with publicly available pretrained weights and 12 general-purpose VLMs -- across \textbf{8 standard datasets} (UTKFace, IMDB-WIKI, MORPH, AFAD, CACD, FG-NET, APPA-REAL, AgeDB) totaling 1{,}100 test images per model. Our key finding is striking: \emph{zero-shot VLMs significantly outperform most specialized models}, achieving an average MAE of 5.65 years compared to 9.88 for non-LLM models. The best VLM (Gemini~3 Flash Preview, MAE~4.32) outperforms the best non-LLM model (MiVOLO, MAE~5.10) by 15\%. Only MiVOLO, which uniquely combines face and body features via Vision Transformers, competes with VLMs. We further analyze age verification at the 18-year threshold, revealing that non-LLM models exhibit 60--100\% false adult rates on minors while VLMs achieve 13--25\%, and demonstrate that coarse age binning (8--9 classes) consistently degrades MAE beyond 13 years. Our stratified analysis across 14 age groups reveals that all models struggle most at extreme ages ($<$5 and 65+). These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific architectures are necessary for age estimation and suggest that the field should redirect toward distilling VLM capabilities into efficient specialized models.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的重建方法通常假设高斯噪声，与SMS采集中的算子主导退化不匹配，因此需要一种更匹配的框架来改善重建质量。

Method: 提出了一种基于已知采集算子的操作引导框架，设计了OCDI-Net网络，通过双流交互明确分离目标切片内容和切片间干扰，并采用两阶段链式推理进行重建。

Result: 在fastMRI脑数据和前瞻性扩散MRI数据上的实验表明，该方法在保真度和减少切片泄漏方面优于传统和基于学习的SMS重建方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的OCDI-Net框架在SMS成像中通过明确分离目标切片内容和切片间干扰，结合确定性更新和两阶段推理，显著提高了重建的保真度并减少了切片泄漏。

Abstract: Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging with in-plane undersampling enables highly accelerated MRI but yields a strongly coupled inverse problem with deterministic inter-slice interference and missing k-space data. Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion. Experiments on fastMRI brain data and prospectively acquired in vivo diffusion MRI data demonstrate improved fidelity and reduced slice leakage over conventional and learning-based SMS reconstructions.

Motivation: OVAD和RSVG各自存在局限性，无法同时支持丰富的语义理解和多目标检测，因此需要一种统一的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了任务重构策略和密集语义对齐策略，基于RT-DETR架构引入高效模块，扩展至开放文本检测。

Conclusion: OTA-Det通过统一OVAD和RSVG范式，实现了丰富的语义理解和多目标检测，同时在六个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并保持了实时推理速度。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Aerial Detection (OVAD) and Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) have emerged as two key paradigms for aerial scene understanding. However, each paradigm suffers from inherent limitations when operating in isolation: OVAD is restricted to coarse category-level semantics, while RSVG is structurally limited to single-target localization. These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS.

Conclusion: 研究强调了评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成推理链的忠实性的重要性，并提出了SAGE框架来改善视觉路由和推理对齐。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning is widely used to improve the interpretability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the faithfulness of the generated reasoning traces remains unclear. Prior work has mainly focused on perceptual hallucinations, leaving reasoning level unfaithfulness underexplored. To isolate faithfulness from linguistic priors, we introduce SPD-Faith Bench, a diagnostic benchmark based on fine-grained image difference reasoning that enforces explicit visual comparison. Evaluations on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal two systematic failure modes, perceptual blindness and perception-reasoning dissociation. We trace these failures to decaying visual attention and representation shifts in the residual stream. Guided by this analysis, we propose SAGE, a train-free visual evidence-calibrated framework that improves visual routing and aligns reasoning with perception. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly evaluating faithfulness beyond response correctness. Our benchmark and codes are available at https://github.com/Johanson-colab/SPD-Faith-Bench.

Abstract: We present a training-free, plug-and-play method, namely VFace, for high-quality face swapping in videos. It can be seamlessly integrated with image-based face swapping approaches built on diffusion models. First, we introduce a Frequency Spectrum Attention Interpolation technique to facilitate generation and intact key identity characteristics. Second, we achieve Target Structure Guidance via plug-and-play attention injection to better align the structural features from the target frame to the generation. Third, we present a Flow-Guided Attention Temporal Smoothening mechanism that enforces spatiotemporal coherence without modifying the underlying diffusion model to reduce temporal inconsistencies typically encountered in frame-wise generation. Our method requires no additional training or video-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances temporal consistency and visual fidelity, offering a practical and modular solution for video-based face swapping.

Result: ViewRope显著改善了长期一致性，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: ViewRope通过引入几何感知编码和选择性注意力机制，显著提升了长期一致性并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: SSI-Bench 揭示了当前视觉-语言模型在空间推理能力上的显著不足，尤其是在结构基础和约束一致的3D推理方面。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is crucial for vision--language models (VLMs) in the physical world, yet many benchmarks evaluate largely unconstrained scenes where models can exploit 2D shortcuts. We introduce SSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark for spatial reasoning on constrained manifolds, built from complex real-world 3D structures whose feasible configurations are tightly governed by geometric, topological, and physical constraints. SSI-Bench contains 1,000 ranking questions spanning geometric and topological reasoning and requiring a diverse repertoire of compositional spatial operations, such as mental rotation, cross-sectional inference, occlusion reasoning, and force-path reasoning. It is created via a fully human-centered pipeline: ten researchers spent over 400 hours curating images, annotating structural components, and designing questions to minimize pixel-level cues. Evaluating 31 widely used VLMs reveals a large gap to humans: the best open-source model achieves 22.2% accuracy and the strongest closed-source model reaches 33.6%, while humans score 91.6%. Encouraging models to think yields only marginal gains, and error analysis points to failures in structural grounding and constraint-consistent 3D reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床重要线索微妙、高度局部化且常被重叠解剖结构或不同成像视角所掩盖，检索具有类似骨折模式的手腕X光片具有挑战性。此外，缺乏大型、注释良好的数据集也限制了进展。

Method: WristMIR利用密集放射学报告和骨特异性定位，通过全局和局部对比编码器的联合训练，以及两阶段检索过程（全局粗匹配和区域条件重排）来学习细粒度的临床有意义图像表示。

Result: WristMIR显著提高了检索性能，将图像到文本的Recall@5从0.82%提升至9.35%，其嵌入还实现了更强的骨折分类（AUROC 0.949，AUPRC 0.953）。在区域感知评估中，两阶段设计显著提高了基于检索的骨折诊断，平均F1分数从0.568增至0.753。

Conclusion: WristMIR展示了通过解剖学引导的检索在儿科肌肉骨骼影像中增强诊断推理和支持临床决策的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieving wrist radiographs with analogous fracture patterns is challenging because clinically important cues are subtle, highly localized and often obscured by overlapping anatomy or variable imaging views. Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

Conclusion: SAGE通过利用互联网视频流，提出了一种可扩展的几何基础模型适应框架，显著提升了零样本泛化能力，为通用3D学习建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Geometric foundation models show promise in 3D reconstruction, yet their progress is severely constrained by the scarcity of diverse, large-scale 3D annotations. While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning.

Conclusion: TLQ框架通过细粒度的校准策略和分布式层校准方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型的量化稳定性，并在多种模型规模和量化设置下表现一致。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a primary approach for deploying large language models without fine-tuning, and the quantized performance is often strongly affected by the calibration in PTQ. By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability. The code will be released publicly.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are often used for zero-shot detection of visual attributes in the image. We present a zero-shot evaluation of open-source VLMs for privacy-related attribute recognition. We identify the attributes for which VLMs exhibit strong inter-annotator agreement, and discuss the disagreement cases of human and VLM annotations. Our results show that when evaluated against human annotations, VLMs tend to predict the presence of privacy attributes more often than human annotators. In addition to this, we find that in cases of high inter-annotator agreement between VLMs, they can complement human annotation by identifying attributes overlooked by human annotators. This highlights the potential of VLMs to support privacy annotations in large-scale image datasets.

Abstract: Crowd scenes captured by cameras at different locations vary greatly, and existing crowd models have limited generalization for unseen surveillance scenes. To improve the generalization of the model, we regard different surveillance scenes as different category scenes, and introduce few-shot learning to make the model adapt to the unseen surveillance scene that belongs to the given exemplar category scene. To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way. Experiments on three surveillance datasets shows that proposed method can adapt to the unseen surveillance scene and outperform recent state-of-the-art methods in the few-shot crowd counting.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is a primary source of information in videos; therefore, accurately identifying who spoke what and when is essential for deep video understanding. We introduce D-ORCA, a \textbf{d}ialogue-centric \textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \textbf{r}obust audio-visual \textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding. Notably, despite having only 8 billion parameters, D-ORCA achieves performance competitive with Qwen3-Omni across several general-purpose audio-visual understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: EasyTune通过分步微调扩散模型和引入SPL机制，显著提升了运动生成模型的对齐性能，同时大幅降低了内存消耗并加速了训练过程。

Abstract: In recent years, motion generative models have undergone significant advancement, yet pose challenges in aligning with downstream objectives. Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，FSP-Diff在图像质量和计算效率上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FSP-Diff框架在超低剂量光谱CT重建中显著优于现有方法，展示了其在临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Spectral computed tomography (CT) with photon-counting detectors holds immense potential for material discrimination and tissue characterization. However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging.

Conclusion: 提出的CSDN方法在超稀疏视角CBCT重建中有效抑制了伪影并恢复了精细纹理，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The clinical application of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is constrained by the inherent trade-off between radiation exposure and image quality. Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology and its increasing realism necessitate improved detection methods to counteract potential misuse.

Method: A comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against advanced synthesis methods.

Result: Many state-of-the-art detection models perform poorly against modern deepfake synthesis techniques, with human participants also struggling against high-quality deepfakes.

Conclusion: The study underscores the urgent need for refining detection models to match the evolving sophistication of deepfake generation technologies, highlighting a critical gap in current methodologies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technology has significantly elevated the realism and accessibility of synthetic media. Emerging techniques, such as diffusion-based models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), alongside enhancements in traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have contributed to the sophisticated generation of deepfake videos. Concurrently, deepfake detection methods have seen notable progress, driven by innovations in Transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and other machine learning approaches. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods. Our findings highlight a concerning trend: many state-of-the-art detection models exhibit markedly poor performance when challenged with deepfakes produced by modern synthesis techniques, including poor performance by human participants against the best quality deepfakes. Through extensive experimentation, we provide evidence that underscores the urgent need for continued refinement of detection models to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of deepfake generation technologies. This research emphasizes the critical gap between current detection methodologies and the sophistication of new generation techniques, calling for intensified efforts in this crucial area of study.

Conclusion: MCIE-E1在复杂指令图像编辑任务中表现优异，显著提升了指令遵循能力和背景一致性，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-based image editing have shown remarkable progress. However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance.

Motivation: 囊性水瘤是一种高风险产前超声发现，与染色体异常、结构畸形和不良妊娠结局相关。自动化检测可提高可重复性并支持早期筛查，但监督深度学习方法受限于小规模标记数据集。

Method: 研究使用超声特定的自监督预训练模型USF-MAE（基于掩码自编码），并在37万张未标记的超声图像上进行预训练，随后对正常对照组和囊性水瘤病例进行二元分类微调。

Result: USF-MAE在准确性（0.96）、敏感性（0.94）、特异性（0.98）和ROC-AUC（0.98）上均优于DenseNet-169基线模型（0.93、0.92、0.94、0.94），且Score-CAM可视化显示模型预测具有临床相关性。

Conclusion: USF-MAE模型在超声图像中自动检测囊性水瘤方面表现优于DenseNet-169基线模型，具有更高的准确性、敏感性和特异性，且结果具有统计学意义。

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Abstract: Deep learning-based garment draping has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Physics-Based Simulation (PBS), yet robust collision handling remains a critical bottleneck. Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time.

Motivation: 现有VLLMs加速框架独立压缩空间和时间冗余，忽略了时空关系，导致次优压缩效果。FlashVID旨在通过动态视频特征的高相关性优化时空压缩。

Method: FlashVID采用基于注意力和多样性的令牌选择（ADTS）和基于树的时空令牌合并（TSTM）方法，分别用于基础视频表示和细粒度时空冗余消除。

Result: 实验表明，FlashVID在五个视频理解基准测试中表现出色，可将Qwen2.5-VL的视频帧输入提升10倍，计算预算内相对性能提升8.6%。

Conclusion: FlashVID是一种无需训练、即插即用的推理加速框架，通过保留10%的视觉令牌即可保持99.1%的性能表现，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Although Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in video understanding, they are required to process high volumes of visual tokens, causing significant computational inefficiency. Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Abstract: World models aim to understand, remember, and predict dynamic visual environments, yet a unified benchmark for evaluating their fundamental abilities remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

*Yahia Hamdi,Nicolas Andrialovanirina,Kélig Mahé,Emilie Poisson Caillault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-DCGAN combines 3D CGANs with MoE to improve 3D object generation and completion, outperforming existing methods with specialized generators and a DCC mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of GANs in capturing complex and diverse data distributions, especially in scenarios with incomplete inputs or significant missing regions, by leveraging MoE models for improved performance and efficiency.

Method: Integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, incorporating multiple specialized generators and an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the effectiveness of the MoE-DCGAN in generating high-quality 3D models and reconstructing incomplete or damaged objects.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE-DCGAN framework effectively addresses the challenges of generating and completing 3D objects, demonstrating superior performance in handling complex and incomplete data compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The generation and completion of 3D objects represent a transformative challenge in computer vision. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed MoE-DCGAN in handling complex 3D data.

### [126] [Vanilla Group Equivariant Vision Transformer: Simple and Effective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08047)
*Jiahong Fu,Qi Xie,Deyu Meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统化构建等变ViT的框架，解决了现有方法在性能和等变性之间的平衡问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的等变ViT在性能和等变性之间难以平衡，主要问题在于难以在ViT的多样化模块中实现全面的等变修改，尤其是协调自注意力机制与补丁嵌入。

Method: 通过系统性地使ViT的关键组件（如补丁嵌入、自注意力、位置编码和上下采样）等变化，构建了一个具有保证等变性的ViT架构。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，所提出的等变ViT在各种视觉任务中持续提升了性能和数据效率。

Conclusion: 提出的等变ViT框架不仅理论上严谨，而且在实际应用中表现出色，能够无缝扩展到Swin Transformers，并在多种视觉任务中提升性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Incorporating symmetry priors as inductive biases to design equivariant Vision Transformers (ViTs) has emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing their performance. However, existing equivariant ViTs often struggle to balance performance with equivariance, primarily due to the challenge of achieving holistic equivariant modifications across the diverse modules in ViTs-particularly in harmonizing the Self-Attention mechanism with Patch Embedding. To address this, we propose a straightforward framework that systematically renders key ViT components, including patch embedding, self-attention, positional encodings, and Down/Up-Sampling, equivariant, thereby constructing ViTs with guaranteed equivariance. The resulting architecture serves as a plug-and-play replacement that is both theoretically grounded and practically versatile, scaling seamlessly even to Swin Transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our equivariant ViTs consistently improve performance and data efficiency across a wide spectrum of vision tasks.

*Yufei Wang,Haixu Liu,Tianxiang Xu,Chuancheng Shi,Hongsheng Xing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多模态弱监督框架，结合伪标签生成和简化MLP骨干，显著提升隐藏情绪识别准确率至0.69。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频中'隐藏情绪'的自动识别问题，克服类别严重不平衡的挑战。

Method: 结合YOLO 11x、DINOv2-Base、Chain-of-Thought + Reflection提示、OpenPose和超长序列Transformer，通过多模态预训练和联合微调，生成伪标签并建模时空关系。

Result: 准确率从之前工作的不足0.6提升至超过0.69，建立了新的公共基准。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种多模态弱监督框架，成功在iMiGUE网球采访数据集上实现了最先进的性能，验证了简化后的MLP关键点骨干网络在该任务中优于传统GCN模型。

Abstract: To tackle the automatic recognition of "concealed emotions" in videos, this paper proposes a multimodal weak-supervision framework and achieves state-of-the-art results on the iMiGUE tennis-interview dataset. First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark. The study also validates that an "MLP-ified" key-point backbone can match - or even surpass - GCN-based counterparts in this task.

### [128] [DICE: Disentangling Artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08059)
*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DICE 是一种无需训练的实时风格消除框架，通过对比子空间分解和自适应注意力解耦，高效抑制风格模仿，平衡风格消除与内容保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的普及使得风格模仿变得轻而易举，但这也带来了版权和知识产权风险。现有的应对措施要么需要昂贵的权重编辑，要么依赖于明确指定的编辑风格，限制了其在实际部署中的实用性。

Method: DICE 通过构建对比三元组，迫使模型在潜在空间中区分风格和非风格特征，并将这一解耦过程形式化为可解的广义特征值问题，实现风格子空间的精确识别。此外，引入自适应注意力解耦编辑策略，动态评估每个令牌的风格集中度，并对 QKV 向量进行差异抑制和内容增强。

Result: 大量实验表明，DICE 在风格消除的彻底性和内容完整性的保留之间取得了优越的平衡，仅需额外 3 秒的开销即可解耦风格。

Conclusion: DICE 提出了一种无需训练、实时消除艺术家风格的框架，通过对比子空间分解和自适应注意力解耦编辑策略，有效平衡了风格消除的彻底性和内容完整性的保留，为抑制风格模仿提供了一种实用且高效的技术。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of diffusion models has made style mimicry effortless, enabling users to imitate unique artistic styles without authorization. In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.

*Chunyang Li,Yuanbo Yang,Jiahao Shao,Hongyu Zhou,Katja Schwarz,Yiyi Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReRoPE是一种即插即用的框架，通过优化Rotary Positional Embeddings的低频波段，实现了对预训练视频扩散模型的相机视角控制，无需额外训练或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用相机姿态进行视频生成时，由于缺乏平移不变性，导致泛化能力差和累积漂移问题。ReRoPE旨在解决这一问题，同时避免高昂的训练成本或架构修改。

Method: ReRoPE通过将相对相机姿态信息无缝注入到Rotary Positional Embeddings（RoPE）中未被充分利用的低频波段，实现了对预训练视频扩散模型的增强。

Result: ReRoPE在图像到视频（I2V）和视频到视频（V2V）任务中，在相机控制精度和视觉保真度方面表现出色。

Conclusion: ReRoPE提供了一种训练高效的方法，实现了可控且高保真的视频生成，同时保持了预训练模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Video generation with controllable camera viewpoints is essential for applications such as interactive content creation, gaming, and simulation. Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity. Our results demonstrate that ReRoPE offers a training-efficient path toward controllable, high-fidelity video generation. See project page for more results: https://sisyphe-lee.github.io/ReRoPE/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用过去五年的架构进步，对Vision Transformer主干进行现代化改造，以提升其性能和适应性。

Method: 通过组件级优化（包括归一化、激活函数、位置编码、门控机制和可学习标记）对Vision Transformer进行现代化改造，同时保留Attention-FFN结构。

Result: ViT-5在ImageNet-1k分类任务中达到84.2%的top-1准确率，优于DeiT-III-Base的83.8%；在生成任务中，ViT-5作为SiT扩散框架的骨干，FID降至1.84，优于普通ViT的2.06。

Conclusion: ViT-5作为一种简单且现代化的Vision Transformer升级方案，在理解和生成任务中均表现出色，并可作为未来视觉基础模型的可靠选择。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into modernizing Vision Transformer backbones by leveraging architectural advancements from the past five years. While preserving the canonical Attention-FFN structure, we conduct a component-wise refinement involving normalization, activation functions, positional encoding, gating mechanisms, and learnable tokens. These updates form a new generation of Vision Transformers, which we call ViT-5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-5 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art plain Vision Transformers across both understanding and generation benchmarks. On ImageNet-1k classification, ViT-5-Base reaches 84.2\% top-1 accuracy under comparable compute, exceeding DeiT-III-Base at 83.8\%. ViT-5 also serves as a stronger backbone for generative modeling: when plugged into an SiT diffusion framework, it achieves 1.84 FID versus 2.06 with a vanilla ViT backbone. Beyond headline metrics, ViT-5 exhibits improved representation learning and favorable spatial reasoning behavior, and transfers reliably across tasks. With a design aligned with contemporary foundation-model practices, ViT-5 offers a simple drop-in upgrade over vanilla ViT for mid-2020s vision backbones.

Motivation: 尽管生成式多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频任务上的表现不及视频基础模型（VFMs），但本文旨在探索如何利用MLLMs进行视频-文本嵌入与检索。

Method: 首先进行系统性的层间分析，发现中间层已编码大量任务相关信息。随后结合中间层嵌入与校准的MLLM头部，并引入轻量级文本对齐策略，将密集视频字幕映射为简短摘要。

Result: 无需额外训练或视觉监督，该方法在常见视频检索基准测试中显著优于现有方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过结合中间层嵌入和校准的MLLM头部，无需训练即可实现强大的零样本检索性能。此外，轻量级的文本对齐策略显著提升了视频检索性能，无需视觉监督即可达到最先进的结果。

Abstract: Recent studies have adapted generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into embedding extractors for vision tasks, typically through fine-tuning to produce universal representations. However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: We present MMLSv2, a dataset for landslide segmentation on Martian surfaces. MMLSv2 consists of multimodal imagery with seven bands: RGB, digital elevation model, slope, thermal inertia, and grayscale channels. MMLSv2 comprises 664 images distributed across training, validation, and test splits. In addition, an isolated test set of 276 images from a geographically disjoint region from the base dataset is released to evaluate spatial generalization. Experiments conducted with multiple segmentation models show that the dataset supports stable training and achieves competitive performance, while still posing challenges in fragmented, elongated, and small-scale landslide regions. Evaluation on the isolated test set leads to a noticeable performance drop, indicating increased difficulty and highlighting its value for assessing model robustness and generalization beyond standard in-distribution settings.

Abstract: Rapid building damage assessment is critical for post-disaster response. Damage classification models built on satellite imagery provide a scalable means of obtaining situational awareness. However, label noise and severe class imbalance in satellite data create major challenges. The xBD dataset offers a standardized benchmark for building-level damage across diverse geographic regions. In this study, we evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) model performance on the xBD dataset, specifically investigating how these models distinguish between types of structural damage when training on noisy, imbalanced data.
  In this study, we specifically evaluate DINOv2-small and DeiT for multi-class damage classification. We propose a targeted patch-based pre-processing pipeline to isolate structural features and minimize background noise in training. We adopt a frozen-head fine-tuning strategy to keep computational requirements manageable. Model performance is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-averaged F1 scores. We show that small ViT architectures with our novel training method achieves competitive macro-averaged F1 relative to prior CNN baselines for disaster classification.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的3D物体检测是关键，但现有基于BEV的融合框架存在上下文建模低效、空间不变融合及不确定性推理困难等问题。

Conclusion: MambaFusion通过结合选择性状态空间模型（SSMs）和窗口化Transformer，实现了高效、自适应且物理基础的多模态3D感知，为自动驾驶系统提供了鲁棒、时间稳定且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable 3D object detection is fundamental to autonomous driving, and multimodal fusion algorithms using cameras and LiDAR remain a persistent challenge. Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现VLM在分片图像输入中存在安全漏洞，提出SIVA攻击方法并通过Adv-KD算法提升迁移成功率，最终提出改进安全对齐的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLM在预训练和指令调优中对分片图像输入表现良好，但其安全对齐通常仅针对完整图像，未考虑跨多个图像片段分布的有害语义。这导致VLM无法检测和拒绝有害的分片图像输入。

Method: 研究提出了一种分片图像视觉越狱攻击（SIVA），包括从简单分片到自适应白盒攻击的渐进阶段，最终形成黑盒迁移攻击。最强策略采用了一种新颖的对抗性知识蒸馏（Adv-KD）算法，显著提高了跨模型迁移能力。

Result: 在三种最先进的现代VLM和三个越狱数据集上的评估表明，最强攻击的迁移成功率比现有基线高出60%。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的视觉语言模型（VLM）安全漏洞，即分片图像攻击（SIVA），并通过实验证明了其有效性。同时，提出了改进VLM安全对齐效率的方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are now a core part of modern AI. Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment.

Conclusion: DAS-SK被证明是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实时农业机器人和高分辨率遥感，并在其他视觉领域具有广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in high-resolution agricultural imagery demands models that strike a careful balance between accuracy and computational efficiency to enable deployment in practical systems. In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models. These findings establish DAS-SK as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for real-time agricultural robotics and high-resolution remote sensing, with strong potential for broader deployment in other vision domains.

Abstract: Estimating Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising research direction in remote sensing, enabling the recognition of diverse land-cover types beyond pre-defined category sets. However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and GID5 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: 通过结合多种上下文信息，提出的无需训练的Chain-of-Caption框架在多个数据集上显著提升了REC任务的性能，准确率提升了5%至30%。

Abstract: Given a textual description, the task of referring expression comprehension (REC) involves the localisation of the referred object in an image. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved high accuracy on REC benchmarks through scaling up the model size and training data. Moreover, the performance of MLLMs can be further improved using techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and tool use, which provides additional visual or textual context to the model. In this paper, we analyse the effect of various techniques for providing additional visual and textual context via tool use to the MLLM and its effect on the REC task. Furthermore, we propose a training-free framework named Chain-of-Caption to improve the REC performance of MLLMs. We perform experiments on RefCOCO/RefCOCOg/RefCOCO+ and Ref-L4 datasets and show that individual textual or visual context can improve the REC performance without any fine-tuning. By combining multiple contexts, our training-free framework shows between 5% to 30% performance gain over the baseline model on accuracy at various Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.

Motivation: SAM2在视频对象分割任务中表现出色，但计算负担重，现有改进多集中在轻量化主干网络，缺乏对训练后加速的探索。

Method: 提出了对象感知的稀疏窗口路由（SWR）和稀疏内存检索（SMR）机制，分别优化图像编码器和内存注意力计算。

Result: Efficient-SAM2在SAM2.1-L模型上实现了1.68倍的加速，SA-V测试集上准确率仅下降1.0%。

Conclusion: Efficient-SAM2通过自适应聚焦对象区域并消除任务无关计算，显著提升了推理效率，实现了1.68倍的加速，仅带来1.0%的准确率下降。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) shows excellent performance in video object segmentation tasks; however, the heavy computational burden hinders its application in real-time video processing. Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.

Conclusion: MA-ADV 通过点云表示生成对抗性事件，首次解决了事件相机对抗攻击的难题，实验验证其攻击成功率达100%，且扰动成本最小，凸显了事件感知系统面临的安全挑战。

Abstract: Event cameras have been widely adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and human-computer interaction. A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \textbf{M}otion-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems.

Conclusion: 分析表明，选择性控制视觉想象在空间推理中至关重要，既能匹配或超越固定想象策略，又能显著减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于功能连接（FC）的方法将4D BOLD信号简化为静态2D矩阵，忽略了时间动态性和非线性关系，限制了分类性能。

Method: 提出了DeCI框架，包含两个关键原则：（i）周期与漂移分解（Cycle and Drift Decomposition）；（ii）通道独立性（Channel-Independence），分别建模每个ROI。

Result: DeCI在五个公共数据集上均优于传统FC方法和时间序列基线模型，验证了直接建模时间信息的价值。

Conclusion: DeCI框架通过直接建模时间信息（如周期性和漂移趋势）显著提升了fMRI脑疾病分类的准确性和泛化能力，推动了fMRI分析向端到端时间建模的转变。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables non-invasive brain disorder classification by capturing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/DeCI.

Conclusion: PISCO模型在稀疏控制条件下表现优于现有的修复和视频编辑基线，并随着控制信号的增加显示出明显的性能提升。

Abstract: The landscape of AI video generation is undergoing a pivotal shift: moving beyond general generation - which relies on exhaustive prompt-engineering and "cherry-picking" - towards fine-grained, controllable generation and high-fidelity post-processing. In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Conclusion: 本文提出的多模态融合框架和伪标签聚合策略在PA数据有限且分布偏移显著的情况下，显著提升了植物分布预测的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale, cross-species plant distribution prediction plays a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, yet modeling efforts in this area still face significant challenges due to the sparsity and bias of observational data. Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts.

Abstract: Audio-visual learning suffers from modality misalignment caused by off-screen sources and background clutter, and current methods usually amplify irrelevant regions or moments, leading to unstable training and degraded representation quality. To address this challenge, we proposed a novel Caption-aligned and Agreement-guided Enhancement framework (CAE-AV) for audio-visual learning, which used two complementary modules: Cross-modal Agreement-guided Spatio-Temporal Enrichment (CASTE) and Caption-Aligned Saliency-guided Enrichment (CASE) to relieve audio-visual misalignment. CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment. CASE injects cross-modal semantic guidance into selected spatio-temporal positions, leveraging high-level semantic cues to further alleviate misalignment. In addition, we design lightweight objectives, caption-to-modality InfoNCE, visual-audio consistency, and entropy regularization to guide token selection and strengthen cross-modal semantic alignment. With frozen backbones, CAE-AV achieves state-of-the-art performance on AVE, AVVP, AVS, and AVQA benchmarks, and qualitative analyses further validate its robustness against audio-visual misalignment.

Conclusion: LG-Tok通过语言引导的标记化方法，在保持高重建质量的同时降低了生成复杂度，显著优于现有方法，验证了其语义表示的高效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on motion discrete tokenization, which converts raw motion into compact discrete tokens--a process proven crucial for efficient motion generation. In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147. LG-Tok-mini uses only half the tokens while maintaining competitive performance (Top-1: 0.521/0.588, FID: 0.085/0.071), validating the efficiency of our semantic representations.

Abstract: Learning transferable multimodal embeddings for urban environments is challenging because urban understanding is inherently spatial, yet existing datasets and benchmarks lack explicit alignment between street-view images and urban structure. We introduce UGData, a spatially grounded dataset that anchors street-view images to structured spatial graphs and provides graph-aligned supervision via spatial reasoning paths and spatial context captions, exposing distance, directionality, connectivity, and neighborhood context beyond image content. Building on UGData, we propose UGE, a two-stage training strategy that progressively and stably aligns images, text, and spatial structures by combining instruction-guided contrastive learning with graph-based spatial encoding. We finally introduce UGBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how spatially grounded embeddings support diverse urban understanding tasks -- including geolocation ranking, image retrieval, urban perception, and spatial grounding. We develop UGE on multiple state-of-the-art VLM backbones, including Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral, and train fixed-dimensional spatial embeddings with LoRA tuning. UGE built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone achieves up to 44% improvement in image retrieval and 30% in geolocation ranking on training cities, and over 30% and 22% gains respectively on held-out cities, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit spatial grounding for spatially intensive urban tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has demonstrated excellent abilities in various visual tasks. Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and establish crucial foundations for advancing PRMs in LVLMs.

Abstract: E-commerce short videos represent a high-revenue segment of the online video industry characterized by a goal-driven format and dense multi-modal signals. Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a \textbf{multi-modal information density assessment framework} to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds)}, which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop \textbf{E-VAds-R1}, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called \textbf{MG-GRPO}. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.

Conclusion: GeoEdit框架通过扩散变换模块和效果敏感注意力机制，显著提升了图像编辑的几何精度和光影效果的真实性，实验证明其在视觉质量、几何准确性和真实感方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image editing. However, challenges persist in handling geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, particularly in complex scenes. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) difficulty in achieving accurate geometric editing of object translation, rotation, and scaling; (2) inadequate modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects, leading to unrealistic results. To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that GeoEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality, geometric accuracy, and realism.

Conclusion: D$^2$-VR通过创新的Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment模块和对抗蒸馏范式，显著提升了视频修复的效率和稳定性，实现了12倍的加速，同时保持了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The integration of diffusion priors with temporal alignment has emerged as a transformative paradigm for video restoration, delivering fantastic perceptual quality, yet the practical deployment of such frameworks is severely constrained by prohibitive inference latency and temporal instability when confronted with complex real-world degradations. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{D$^2$-VR}, a single-image diffusion-based video-restoration framework with low-step inference. To obtain precise temporal guidance under severe degradation, we first design a Degradation-Robust Flow Alignment (DRFA) module that leverages confidence-aware attention to filter unreliable motion cues. We then incorporate an adversarial distillation paradigm to compress the diffusion sampling trajectory into a rapid few-step regime. Finally, a synergistic optimization strategy is devised to harmonize perceptual quality with rigorous temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D$^2$-VR achieves state-of-the-art performance while accelerating the sampling process by \textbf{12$\times$}

Abstract: Deep learning has the potential to improve colonoscopy by enabling 3D reconstruction of the colon, providing a comprehensive view of mucosal surfaces and lesions, and facilitating the identification of unexplored areas. However, the development of robust methods is limited by the scarcity of large-scale ground truth data. We propose RealSynCol, a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to replicate the endoscopic environment. Colon geometries extracted from 10 CT scans were imported into a virtual environment that closely mimics intraoperative conditions and rendered with realistic vascular textures. The resulting dataset comprises 28\,130 frames, paired with ground truth depth maps, optical flow, 3D meshes, and camera trajectories. A benchmark study was conducted to evaluate the available synthetic colon datasets for the tasks of depth and pose estimation. Results demonstrate that the high realism and variability of RealSynCol significantly enhance generalization performance on clinical images, proving it to be a powerful tool for developing deep learning algorithms to support endoscopic diagnosis.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of training attention-based sparse image matching models for various local features. We first identify one critical design choice that has been previously overlooked, which significantly impacts the performance of the LightGlue model. We then investigate the role of detectors and descriptors within the transformer-based matching framework, finding that detectors, rather than descriptors, are often the primary cause for performance difference. Finally, we propose a novel approach to fine-tune existing image matching models using keypoints from a diverse set of detectors, resulting in a universal, detector-agnostic model. When deployed as a zero-shot matcher for novel detectors, the resulting model achieves or exceeds the accuracy of models specifically trained for those features. Our findings offer valuable insights for the deployment of transformer-based matching models and the future design of local features.

Conclusion: Demo-ICL模型通过两阶段训练策略显著提升了从上下文示例中学习的能力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite the growing video understanding capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), existing video benchmarks primarily assess understanding based on models' static, internal knowledge, rather than their ability to learn and adapt from dynamic, novel contexts from few examples. To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.

TL;DR: Vista是一个场景感知的流媒体视频问答框架，通过动态场景分割、压缩和召回实现高效长时推理，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流媒体视频问答（Streaming Video QA）对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）提出了独特挑战，因为视频帧是顺序到达的，用户查询可以在任意时间点发出。现有解决方案依赖于固定大小的内存或简单压缩，常常遭受上下文丢失或内存溢出的问题，限制了其在长时、实时场景中的有效性。

Method: Vista通过三个创新方面实现高效和可扩展的流媒体视频问答：(1) 场景感知分割，动态将连续帧聚类为时间和视觉上连贯的场景单元；(2) 场景感知压缩，将每个场景压缩为紧凑的令牌表示并存储在GPU内存中，同时将全分辨率帧卸载到CPU内存；(3) 场景感知召回，在收到查询时选择性召回并重新整合相关场景到模型输入中。

Result: Vista框架在StreamingBench上的实验证明了其高效性和可扩展性，能够在不影响延迟或内存效率的情况下实现长上下文推理，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Vista框架在StreamingBench上的广泛实验表明，其在实时视频理解任务中达到了最先进的性能，为实际应用中的流媒体视频理解设定了强有力的基准。

Abstract: Streaming video question answering (Streaming Video QA) poses distinct challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as video frames arrive sequentially and user queries can be issued at arbitrary time points. Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.

Result: TriC-Motion在HumanML3D数据集上实现了0.612的R@1分数，显著优于现有方法，能够生成高保真、连贯、多样且与文本对齐的动作序列。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, a rapidly evolving field in computer vision, aims to produce realistic and text-aligned motion sequences. Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/.

Method: 使用WIVW数据集的真实视频序列，应用2D姿态估计技术，提取76个静态和动态特征，将手势分为四类（停止、前进、感谢/问候、无手势）。

Result: 手部位置和移动速度对手势分类特别有效，分类准确率为87%。

Conclusion: 研究发现手势分类框架通过2D姿态估计能有效提升自动驾驶车辆对行人手势的理解，分类准确率达87%，增强了AV系统的感知能力。

Abstract: Gestures are a key component of non-verbal communication in traffic, often helping pedestrian-to-driver interactions when formal traffic rules may be insufficient. This problem becomes more apparent when autonomous vehicles (AVs) struggle to interpret such gestures. In this study, we present a gesture classification framework using 2D pose estimation applied to real-world video sequences from the WIVW dataset. We categorise gestures into four primary classes (Stop, Go, Thank & Greet, and No Gesture) and extract 76 static and dynamic features from normalised keypoints. Our analysis demonstrates that hand position and movement velocity are especially discriminative in distinguishing between gesture classes, achieving a classification accuracy score of 87%. These findings not only improve the perceptual capabilities of AV systems but also contribute to the broader understanding of pedestrian behaviour in traffic contexts.

Conclusion: 本研究强调了光照鲁棒性在食品识别系统中的重要性，并提供了在实际检查场景中部署可靠食品识别系统的实用见解。

Abstract: Visual food recognition systems deployed in real-world environments, such as automated conveyor-belt inspection, are highly sensitive to domain shifts caused by illumination changes. While recent studies have shown that lighting variations can significantly distort food perception by both humans and AI, existing works are often limited to single food categories or controlled settings, and most public food datasets lack explicit illumination annotations.
  In this work, we investigate illumination-induced domain shift in multi-class food category recognition using two widely adopted datasets, Food-101 and Fruits-360. We demonstrate substantial accuracy degradation under cross-dataset evaluation due to mismatched visual conditions. To address this challenge, we construct synthetic illumination-augmented datasets by systematically varying light temperature and intensity, enabling controlled robustness analysis without additional labels.
  We further evaluate cross-dataset transfer learning and domain generalization, with a focus on illumination-sensitive target categories such as apple-based classes. Experimental results show that illumination-aware augmentation significantly improves recognition robustness under domain shift while preserving real-time performance. Our findings highlight the importance of illumination robustness and provide practical insights for deploying reliable food recognition systems in real-world inspection scenarios.

Method: 提出了校正特定rollouts（Octopus）框架，通过重组现有rollouts合成密集的自校正示例，并引入响应掩码策略解耦自校正与直接推理。

Result: Octopus-8B在性能上优于最佳RLVR基线1.0分，且每步训练时间仅需0.72倍。

Conclusion: Octopus-8B 在7个基准测试中表现优异，成为开源VLMs中的最佳模型，显著提升了自校正能力。

Abstract: Self-correction is essential for solving complex reasoning problems in vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only $0.72\times$ training time per step.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFMs在单一EM数据集上通过轻量级适配表现良好，但跨数据集训练时性能下降，显示当前PEFT策略需结合领域对齐机制以提升跨域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉基础模型（VFMs）的潜在表示是否足够通用，以支持跨异构显微镜图像数据集的有效迁移和重用，特别是在线粒体分割任务中。

Method: 研究采用两种模型适配策略：冻结主干网络仅训练轻量级分割头，以及通过低秩适配（LoRA）进行参数高效微调。评估了三种VFMs（DINOv2、DINOv3、OpenCLIP）在两个EM数据集（Lucchi++和VNC）上的表现。

Result: 在单一EM数据集上训练时，所有模型均表现良好，且LoRA能持续提升域内性能；但在多数据集训练时，所有模型性能显著下降，PEFT仅带来边际改善。潜在表示空间分析揭示了数据集间的显著领域不匹配。

Conclusion: 尽管视觉基础模型（VFMs）在单一领域内通过轻量级适配能提供竞争力的电子显微镜（EM）分割结果，但当前的参数高效微调（PEFT）策略不足以在不引入额外领域对齐机制的情况下，跨异构EM数据集获得单一稳健模型。

Abstract: Although vision foundation models (VFMs) are increasingly reused for biomedical image analysis, it remains unclear whether the latent representations they provide are general enough to support effective transfer and reuse across heterogeneous microscopy image datasets. Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: Geometry problem-solving remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), requiring not only global shape recognition but also attention to intricate local relationships related to geometric theory. To address this, we propose GeoFocus, a novel framework comprising two core modules. 1) Critical Local Perceptor, which automatically identifies and emphasizes critical local structure (e.g., angles, parallel lines, comparative distances) through thirteen theory-based perception templates, boosting critical local feature coverage by 61% compared to previous methods. 2) VertexLang, a compact topology formal language, encodes global figures through vertex coordinates and connectivity relations. By replacing bulky code-based encodings, VertexLang reduces global perception training time by 20% while improving topology recognition accuracy. When evaluated in Geo3K, GeoQA, and FormalGeo7K, GeoFocus achieves a 4.7% accuracy improvement over leading specialized models and demonstrates superior robustness in MATHVERSE under diverse visual conditions.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于双网格离散化的自动正则化参数选择方法，有效解决了X射线断层扫描中数据有限时的图像重建问题。

Abstract: Image reconstruction in X-ray tomography is an ill-posed inverse problem, particularly with limited available data. Regularization is thus essential, but its effectiveness hinges on the choice of a regularization parameter that balances data fidelity against a priori information. We present a novel method for automatic parameter selection based on the use of two distinct computational discretizations of the same problem. A feedback control algorithm dynamically adjusts the regularization strength, driving an iterative reconstruction toward the smallest parameter that yields sufficient similarity between reconstructions on the two grids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using real tomographic data.

Abstract: Thermal imaging provides a practical sensing modality for visual SLAM in visually degraded environments such as low illumination, smoke, or adverse weather. However, thermal imagery often exhibits low texture, low contrast, and high noise, complicating feature-based SLAM. In this work, we propose a sparse monocular graph-based SLAM system for thermal imagery that leverages general-purpose learned features -- the SuperPoint detector and LightGlue matcher, trained on large-scale visible-spectrum data to improve cross-domain generalization. To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches. We further incorporate keypoint confidence scores from SuperPoint into a confidence-weighted factor graph to improve estimation robustness. Evaluations on public thermal datasets demonstrate that the proposed system achieves reliable performance without requiring dataset-specific training or fine-tuning a desired feature detector, given the scarcity of quality thermal data. Code will be made available upon publication.

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一MLP，难以捕捉复杂点运动和细粒度动态细节。

Method: 采用双变形网络（IDN和GMN）和预训练光流骨干网络，结合变形引导注意力机制。

Result: FLAG-4D在实验中表现出更高的保真度和时间一致性，细节保留更佳。

Conclusion: FLAG-4D通过双变形网络和运动特征融合，实现了动态场景的高保真重建，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce FLAG-4D, a novel framework for generating novel views of dynamic scenes by reconstructing how 3D Gaussian primitives evolve through space and time. Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SemiNFT超越了简单的统计匹配，实现了更高层次的审美理解，在标准预设转移基准测试中表现优异，并在零样本任务中展现出显著智能。

Abstract: Photorealistic color retouching plays a vital role in visual content creation, yet manual retouching remains inaccessible to non-experts due to its reliance on specialized expertise. Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

Conclusion: 本文回顾了AVS PCC标准的技术和性能比较，展示了其在点云压缩领域的独特性和优势。

Abstract: Point cloud is a prevalent 3D data representation format with significant application values in immersive media, autonomous driving, digital heritage protection, etc. However, the large data size of point clouds poses challenges to transmission and storage, which influences the wide deployments. Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC). In the meantime, the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup of China also have launched and completed the development for its first generation point cloud compression standard, namely AVS PCC. This new standardization effort has adopted many new coding tools and techniques, which are different from the other counterpart standards. This paper reviews the AVS PCC standard from two perspectives, i.e., the related technologies and performance comparisons.

Motivation: 生成模型通常针对精心设计的文本提示优化，缺乏对开放视觉探索的支持，而设计师常从松散连接的视觉参考中寻找灵感。

Method: 使用 CLIP Sparse Autoencoders 提取 CLIP 潜在空间中的编辑方向，并通过视觉手段分解视觉方面生成合成三元组。

Result: 模型能够生成多样且视觉连贯的构图，揭示输入图像之间的潜在关系。

Conclusion: Inspiration Seeds 提供了一种无需依赖文本提示的生成框架，支持创意工作早期的视觉探索和构思。

Abstract: While generative models have become powerful tools for image synthesis, they are typically optimized for executing carefully crafted textual prompts, offering limited support for the open-ended visual exploration that often precedes idea formation. In contrast, designers frequently draw inspiration from loosely connected visual references, seeking emergent connections that spark new ideas. We propose Inspiration Seeds, a generative framework that shifts image generation from final execution to exploratory ideation. Given two input images, our model produces diverse, visually coherent compositions that reveal latent relationships between inputs, without relying on user-specified text prompts. Our approach is feed-forward, trained on synthetic triplets of decomposed visual aspects derived entirely through visual means: we use CLIP Sparse Autoencoders to extract editing directions in CLIP latent space and isolate concept pairs. By removing the reliance on language and enabling fast, intuitive recombination, our method supports visual ideation at the early and ambiguous stages of creative work.

Conclusion: LV-RAE通过增强语义特征的低级信息，显著提高了重建保真度，同时保持了语义抽象和生成质量。

Abstract: Recent work leverages Vision Foundation Models as image encoders to boost the generative performance of latent diffusion models (LDMs), as their semantic feature distributions are easy to learn. However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.

Conclusion: 通过专门处理路径选择性解耦类别和补丁令牌的计算流程，特别是在归一化层和早期查询-键-值投影中，显著提高了密集预测任务的补丁表示质量。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have emerged as powerful, scalable and versatile representation learners. To capture both global and local features, a learnable [CLS] class token is typically prepended to the input sequence of patch tokens. Despite their distinct nature, both token types are processed identically throughout the model. In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy. The proposed modifications introduce only an 8% increase in parameters, with no additional computational overhead. Through comprehensive ablations, we provide insights into which architectural components benefit most from specialization and how our approach generalizes across model scales and learning frameworks.

Method: 提出了一种基于深度学习模型的方法，利用低分辨率预扫描缩略图预测固定类型，训练数据来自TUM病理研究所的WSIs，并在TCGA、Augsburg和Regensburg的数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 模型在TCGA数据集上AUROC为0.88，比同类方法高4.8%；在Regensburg和Augsburg数据集上AUROC分别为0.72，处理速度比现有高倍全分辨率方法快400倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为高通量病理工作流程中的质量控制提供了高效解决方案，未来将进一步提升模型对不同扫描仪类型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate annotation of fixation type is a critical step in slide preparation for pathology laboratories. However, this manual process is prone to
  errors, impacting downstream analyses and diagnostic accuracy. Existing methods for verifying formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), and frozen
  section (FS) fixation types typically require full-resolution whole-slide images (WSIs), limiting scalability for high-throughput quality control.
  We propose a deep-learning model to predict fixation types using low-resolution, pre-scan thumbnail images. The model was trained on WSIs from
  the TUM Institute of Pathology (n=1,200, Leica GT450DX) and evaluated on a class-balanced subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (TCGA, n=8,800,
  Leica AT2), as well as on class-balanced datasets from Augsburg (n=695 [392 FFPE, 303 FS], Philips UFS) and Regensburg (n=202, 3DHISTECH P1000).
  Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.88 on TCGA, outperforming comparable pre-scan methods by 4.8%. It also achieves AUROCs of 0.72 on Regensburg and
  Augsburg slides, underscoring challenges related to scanner-induced domain shifts. Furthermore, the model processes each slide in 21 ms, $400\times$
  faster than existing high-magnification, full-resolution methods, enabling rapid, high-throughput processing.
  This approach provides an efficient solution for detecting labelling errors without relying on high-magnification scans, offering a valuable tool for
  quality control in high-throughput pathology workflows. Future work will improve and evaluate the model's generalisation to additional scanner
  types. Our findings suggest that this method can increase accuracy and efficiency in digital pathology workflows and may be extended to other
  low-resolution slide annotations.

Conclusion: WiFlow通过创新的编码器-解码器架构，显著降低了模型复杂度和计算成本，为基于WiFi的连续人体姿态估计设定了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is fundamental to intelligent perception in the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling applications ranging from smart healthcare to human-computer interaction. While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

Abstract: Machine learning methods have been successful in many areas, like image classification and natural language processing. However, it still needs to be determined how to apply ML to areas with mathematical constraints, like solving PDEs. Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework. Experiments show that our classic solver performs much better than the Pyclaw solver. Then we propose four different deep neural networks for the ML-based solver. The results indicate that two of these approaches could output satisfactory solutions.

TL;DR: OV-Encoder aligns with video Codecs to focus on sparse predictive regions, achieving better efficiency and accuracy than current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision architectures waste compute on redundant visual signals rather than focusing on predictive residuals. Aligning architectures with information-theoretic principles of video (Codecs) can improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: OneVision-Encoder employs Codec Patchification to focus on regions rich in signal entropy, using a shared 3D RoPE and trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective.

Result: OV-Encoder outperforms Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 benchmarks, with a 4.1% average improvement on video tasks, using fewer tokens and data.

Conclusion: Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.

Abstract: Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.
  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.
  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.

Conclusion: VLLVE++通过引入残差项和双向学习机制，显著提升了低光视频增强的性能，尤其在处理真实场景和高动态视频时表现优异。

Abstract: Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic or static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Omni Dense Captioning, a novel task designed to generate continuous, fine-grained, and structured audio-visual narratives with explicit timestamps. To ensure dense semantic coverage, we introduce a six-dimensional structural schema to create "script-like" captions, enabling readers to vividly imagine the video content scene by scene, akin to a cinematographic screenplay. To facilitate research, we construct OmniDCBench, a high-quality, human-annotated benchmark, and propose SodaM, a unified metric that evaluates time-aware detailed descriptions while mitigating scene boundary ambiguity. Furthermore, we construct a training dataset, TimeChatCap-42K, and present TimeChat-Captioner-7B, a strong baseline trained via SFT and GRPO with task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeChat-Captioner-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro, while its generated dense descriptions significantly boost downstream capabilities in audio-visual reasoning (DailyOmni and WorldSense) and temporal grounding (Charades-STA).

Abstract: Contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on a wide range of tasks by pairing a vision encoder with a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned for visual-text inputs. Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to "see". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于分割驱动的规则方法在CT和MR图像中表现出最强且最一致的性能，而MLLM在视觉显著区域表现良好，但分割感知MLLM存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Reliable identification of anatomical body regions is a prerequisite for many automated medical imaging workflows, yet existing solutions remain heavily dependent on unreliable DICOM metadata. Current solutions mainly use supervised learning, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether body region detection in volumetric CT and MR images can be achieved in a fully zero-shot manner by using knowledge embedded in large pre-trained foundation models. We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage. The MLLM performs competitively in visually distinctive regions, while the segmentation-aware MLLM reveals fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: FusionEdit通过软掩码边界和统计注意力融合技术，显著提升了图像编辑的精确性和可控性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions according to the target prompt while preserving the identity of the source image. Recent methods exploit explicit binary masks to constrain editing, but hard mask boundaries introduce artifacts and reduce editability. To address these issues, we propose FusionEdit, a training-free image editing framework that achieves precise and controllable edits. First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results. Second, FusionEdit leverages AdaIN-based modulation within DiT attention layers to perform a statistical attention fusion in the editing region, enhancing editability while preserving global consistency with the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FusionEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究通过合成数据集和脉冲神经网络（SNNs）展示了在眼动分类任务中的高效性和稳定性，为事件相机在认知研究中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The study of eye movements, particularly saccades and fixations, are fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of human cognition and perception. Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

Motivation: 欠采样CT体积虽减少了采集时间和辐射暴露，但会引入伪影，降低图像质量和诊断效用。减少这些伪影对高质量成像至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种计算效率高的混合深度学习框架，结合了2D和3D模型的优势。首先，2D U-Net在欠采样CT体积的单个切片上提取特征图，然后将这些切片特征图堆叠起来作为3D解码器的输入，利用切片间的上下文信息预测无伪影的3D CT体积。

Conclusion: 该混合深度学习框架为高质量3D CT图像后处理提供了一个稳健且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Undersampled CT volumes minimize acquisition time and radiation exposure but introduce artifacts degrading image quality and diagnostic utility. Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead. This hybrid framework presents a robust and efficient solution for high-quality 3D CT image post-processing.

Method: CGA框架包含三个部分：MCA（检测方向性混淆对）、MCC（利用CLIP构建混淆感知的文本提示）、FAM（通过对比学习对齐特征空间）。

Conclusion: CGA框架通过显式建模和缓解类别混淆，在无源域适应任务中显著优于现有方法，特别是在易混淆和细粒度场景下。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) tackles the problem of adapting a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without accessing any source data, which is quite suitable for the field of data security. Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA

TL;DR: HATCH是一种多图像空间推理训练框架，通过补丁级对齐和动作-答案推理提升性能，优于基线模型并与大规模模型竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多图像空间推理需要整合来自多个视角的信息，现有方法仅部分且隐式地结合了人类认知机制（跨视图对应和逐步视角变换），缺乏明确监督。

Method: HATCH通过两个互补目标实现：1）跨视图的补丁级空间对齐，鼓励不同视图中对应区域的补丁表示对齐；2）动作-答案推理，要求模型在预测最终答案前生成明确的视角转换动作。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，HATCH明显优于同类基线模型，并与更大规模的模型竞争。

Conclusion: HATCH框架在保持单图像推理能力的同时，显著提升了多图像空间推理性能，并在多个基准测试中优于同类基线模型，甚至与更大规模的模型竞争。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in single-image spatial reasoning, multi-image spatial reasoning, which requires integration of information from multiple viewpoints, remains challenging. Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的基于流的编辑器主要支持全局或单指令编辑，难以处理多实例场景中多个部分独立编辑的需求，原因是全局条件速度场和联合注意力机制导致编辑纠缠。

Method: 提出了Instance-Disentangled Attention机制，通过分割联合注意力操作，在速度场估计过程中强制绑定实例特定的文本指令与空间区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多实例编辑任务中促进了编辑的解耦和局部性，同时保持了全局输出的连贯性。

Conclusion: 通过引入Instance-Disentangled Attention机制，该方法成功解决了多实例编辑中的语义干扰问题，实现了单次传递的实例级编辑，同时保持了全局输出的连贯性。

Abstract: Flow matching models have recently emerged as an efficient alternative to diffusion, especially for text-guided image generation and editing, offering faster inference through continuous-time dynamics. However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing.

Therefore, we introduce MVAnimate, a novel framework that synthesizes both 2D and 3D information of dynamic figures based on multi-view prior information, to enhance the generated video quality. Our approach leverages multi-view prior information to produce temporally consistent and spatially coherent animation outputs, demonstrating improvements over existing animation methods. Our MVAnimate also optimizes the multi-view videos of the target character, enhancing the video quality from different views. Experimental results on diverse datasets highlight the robustness of our method in handling various motion patterns and appearances.

Abstract: Talking-head avatars are increasingly adopted in educational technology to deliver content with social presence and improved engagement. However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

Abstract: The pantograph-catenary interface is essential for ensuring uninterrupted and reliable power delivery in electrified rail systems. However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.

Abstract: Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task.

Conclusion: 置信驱动的课程学习和选择性遗忘在有限监督和噪声伪标签下提供了鲁棒的分割效果。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is limited by expensive annotations and data heterogeneity across scanners and sites. We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed. These results show that confidence-driven curricula and selective unlearning provide robust segmentation under limited supervision and noisy pseudo-labels.

Abstract: We present Omni-Video 2, a scalable and computationally efficient model that connects pretrained multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) with video diffusion models for unified video generation and editing. Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.

TL;DR: 开发了一个统一基础模型，通过对比学习和视觉语言对齐实现任意到所有MRI合成，提升鼻咽癌放疗规划的准确性和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI在鼻咽癌放疗中至关重要，但患者不适、扫描时间长和高成本等实际限制常导致临床实践中模态不全，影响放疗规划准确性。传统MRI合成方法局限于特定模态，解剖适应性差且缺乏临床可解释性。

Method: 模型采用对比编码器获取模态不变表示，并基于CLIP的文本信息解码器实现语义一致的合成，通过一个统一的基础模型支持任意到所有MRI合成。

Result: 模型在13个机构的40,825张图像上训练，在26个内外部验证站点（15,748张图像）上表现一致优异（平均SSIM 0.90，PSNR 27），合成保真度高，对噪声和域偏移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合对比视觉表示学习和视觉语言对齐，开发了一个统一的基础模型，支持任意到所有MRI合成，显著提升了鼻咽癌放疗规划的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) radiotherapy (RT), but practical constraints, such as patient discomfort, long scan times, and high costs often lead to incomplete modalities in clinical practice, compromising RT planning accuracy. Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model. Trained on 40,825 images from 13 institutions, it achieves consistently high performance (average SSIM 0.90, PSNR 27) across 26 internal/external validation sites (15,748 images), with superior synthesis fidelity and robustness to noise and domain shifts. Meanwhile, its unified representation enhances downstream RT-relevant tasks (e.g., segmentation). This work advances digital medicine solutions for NPC care by leveraging foundation models to bridge technical synthesis and clinical utility.

TL;DR: VideoVeritas通过强化学习提升细粒度感知能力，结合事实推理，在视频生成检测任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频生成能力的增强，其安全风险也随之上升，因此需要可靠的检测方法。当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽具备强推理能力，但细粒度感知能力有限。

Method: 采用联合偏好对齐和感知借口强化学习（PPRL），在强化学习阶段使用通用的时空定位和自监督对象计数任务来增强检测性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，VideoVeritas在多样化基准测试中表现更均衡，而现有方法往往偏向于表面推理或机械分析。

Conclusion: VideoVeritas框架通过结合细粒度感知和基于事实的推理，在视频生成检测任务中实现了更平衡的性能表现，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing capability of video generation poses escalating security risks, making reliable detection increasingly essential. In this paper, we introduce VideoVeritas, a framework that integrates fine-grained perception and fact-based reasoning. We observe that while current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capacity, their granular perception ability remains limited. To mitigate this, we introduce Joint Preference Alignment and Perception Pretext Reinforcement Learning (PPRL). Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods tend to bias towards either superficial reasoning or mechanical analysis, while VideoVeritas achieves more balanced performance across diverse benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在剪枝整个块时可能丢弃重要信息，导致性能下降；而通道剪枝虽能保留性能，却无法减少模型深度。因此，需要一种既能压缩深度又能保留性能的方法。

Method: 提出 FlattenGPT，通过将相邻的两个块合并为一个来压缩网络深度，同时更有效地检测和移除参数冗余。

Result: 在 LLaMA-2/3 和 Qwen-1.5 模型上，FlattenGPT 在压缩 20% 的情况下保留了 90-96% 的零样本性能，并在加速 LLM 推理方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: FlattenGPT 在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了效率，优于现有的剪枝方法，并在不同模型和参数规模上表现优异。

Abstract: Recent works have indicated redundancy across transformer blocks, prompting the research of depth compression to prune less crucial blocks. However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\%. It also outperforms other pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference, making it promising for enhancing the efficiency of transformers.

TL;DR: TiFRe框架通过文本引导选择关键帧并整合非关键帧信息，有效降低Video MLLMs的计算成本，同时提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video MLLMs在处理大量视频帧时计算成本高，固定帧率选择关键帧会忽略非关键帧的有价值信息，导致性能下降。因此，需要一种既能减少帧数又能保留关键信息的方法。

Method: 提出了Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe)框架，包括Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS)策略和Frame Matching and Merging (FMM)机制。TFS通过用户输入生成CLIP风格提示，利用预训练CLIP编码器计算语义相似度选择关键帧；FMM将非关键帧信息整合到关键帧中，减少信息丢失。

Result: 实验表明，TiFRe在减少计算成本的同时，提升了视频语言任务的性能。

Conclusion: TiFRe框架通过文本引导的帧采样和帧匹配合并机制，有效减少了视频输入帧数，同时保留了关键信息，显著降低了计算成本并提升了视频语言任务的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Video Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Video MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in video-language tasks such as video understanding and question answering. However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.

Motivation: 探究标准多视角优化中3DGS解决方案的结构特性，理解其参数的决定因素。

Method: 通过可学习性探针训练预测器，从点云无渲染监督重建RORs，并进行方差分解分析参数耦合。

Result: 揭示了RORs的稳定统计模式（混合结构尺度和双模态辐射）及密度分层现象：密集区域参数与几何相关，稀疏区域参数受可见性异质性主导。

Conclusion: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）解决方案中的渲染最优参考（RORs）展现出双重特性：在密集区域表现为几何基元，可通过点云预测；在稀疏区域则需多视角约束作为视图合成基元。密度感知策略能提升训练鲁棒性。

Abstract: We investigate what structure emerges in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) solutions from standard multi-view optimization. We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的3D高斯流场表示方法，用于建模植物生长过程中的时间变化外观，相比现有方法在图像质量和几何精度上表现更优。

Abstract: Modeling the time-varying 3D appearance of plants during their growth poses unique challenges: unlike many dynamic scenes, plants generate new geometry over time as they expand, branch, and differentiate. Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.

Result: 在多个数据集上，MotionCrafter在几何重建和密集场景流估计上分别实现了38.64%和25.0%的改进。

Conclusion: MotionCrafter通过联合表示和优化的4D VAE，在无需后优化的情况下，实现了在几何重建和密集场景流估计上的显著性能提升。

Abstract: We introduce MotionCrafter, a video diffusion-based framework that jointly reconstructs 4D geometry and estimates dense motion from a monocular video. The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

Conclusion: 通过利用目标领域的辅助数据和提出新的评估指标，该方法在有限标注条件下实现了更有意义和实用的体育反馈生成。

Abstract: While there is rapid progress in video-LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities, prior work shows that these models struggle on the challenging task of sports feedback generation and require expensive and difficult-to-collect finetuning feedback data for each sport. This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability. Together, our approach enables more meaningful and practical generation of sports feedback under limited annotations.

Motivation: 扩散模型推理成本高，现有蒸馏方法因线性近似难以匹配教师轨迹的动态变化，导致质量下降。

Method: ArcFlow将推理轨迹的底层速度场参数化为连续动量过程的混合，并通过解析积分避免数值离散误差。

Conclusion: ArcFlow通过非线性的流轨迹近似预训练教师轨迹，实现了高效的少步蒸馏，显著提升了推理速度且保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generation quality, but they suffer from significant inference cost due to their reliance on multiple sequential denoising steps, motivating recent efforts to distill this inference process into a few-step regime. However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of ArcFlow both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Raster2Seq通过序列到序列的方法，结合自回归解码器和可学习锚点，成功实现了从栅格化平面图图像中重构结构化矢量图形的目标，并在多个基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing a structured vector-graphics representation from a rasterized floorplan image is typically an important prerequisite for computational tasks involving floorplans such as automated understanding or CAD workflows. However, existing techniques struggle in faithfully generating the structure and semantics conveyed by complex floorplans that depict large indoor spaces with many rooms and a varying numbers of polygon corners. To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations.

Abstract: This work presents WorldCompass, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training framework for the long-horizon, interactive video-based world models, enabling them to explore the world more accurately and consistently based on interaction signals. To effectively "steer" the world model's exploration, we introduce three core innovations tailored to the autoregressive video generation paradigm: 1) Clip-level rollout Strategy: We generate and evaluate multiple samples at a single target clip, which significantly boosts rollout efficiency and provides fine-grained reward signals. 2) Complementary Reward Functions: We design reward functions for both interaction-following accuracy and visual quality, which provide direct supervision and effectively suppress reward-hacking behaviors. 3) Efficient RL Algorithm: We employ the negative-aware fine-tuning strategy coupled with various efficiency optimizations to efficiently and effectively enhance model capacity. Evaluations on the SoTA open-source world model, WorldPlay, demonstrate that WorldCompass significantly improves interaction accuracy and visual fidelity across various scenarios.

Result: BAR在ImageNet-256上实现了0.99的gFID，超越了连续和离散范式中的领先方法，同时显著降低了采样成本并比先前的连续方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: BAR框架通过逐步生成离散令牌的构成位，有效解决了现有离散生成方法在扩大码本时的性能下降或训练成本过高的问题，实现了在ImageNet-256上0.99的gFID新纪录。

Abstract: This paper challenges the dominance of continuous pipelines in visual generation. We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) is foundational to modern digital infrastructure, yet this context for group work continues to struggle to ensure sufficient contributions in many critical cases. This literature review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is being leveraged to address critical challenges to OSS sustainability, including maintaining contributor engagement, securing funding, ensuring code quality and security, fostering healthy community dynamics, and preventing project abandonment. Synthesizing recent interdisciplinary research, the paper identifies key applications of AI in this domain, including automated bug triaging, system maintenance, contributor onboarding and mentorship, community health analytics, vulnerability detection, and task automation. The review also examines the limitations and ethical concerns that arise from applying AI in OSS contexts, including data availability, bias and fairness, transparency, risks of misuse, and the preservation of human-centered values in collaborative development. By framing AI not as a replacement but as a tool to augment human infrastructure, this study highlights both the promise and pitfalls of AI-driven interventions. It concludes by identifying critical research gaps and proposing future directions at the intersection of AI, sustainability, and OSS, aiming to support more resilient and equitable open-source ecosystems.

Key findings reveal that (1) models achieving identical perfect scores exhibit 22x variation in completion time, 49x variation in tool efficiency, and 53x variation in estimated cost; (2) tool usage frequency shows no correlation with success (r = 0.077, p = 0.575) - one model used 917 tool calls while another solved the same task with 3 calls; (3) we identify two distinct inefficiency patterns: loop inefficiency and inference inefficiency; and (4) coding tasks achieve 100 percent success while research tasks present greater challenges (90.9 percent). We release all experimental data, verification scripts, and analysis code for full reproducibility.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过分析LLM内部计算结构来验证生成代码功能正确性的方法，减少对外部验证的依赖，并在多种编程语言中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否可以通过LLM的内部计算结构来评估其功能正确性，减少对外部验证机制的依赖。

Method: 受机制可解释性启发，将代码验证视为机制诊断任务，通过分解复杂的残差流，识别模型内部电路中区分合理推理与逻辑失败的结构特征。

Result: 分析证实，内在正确性信号在不同语法中具有鲁棒性，内部图的拓扑特征比表面启发式方法更能可靠预测正确性，并能进行针对性因果干预以修正错误逻辑。

Conclusion: 研究发现，LLM的内部计算结构可以编码可解码的信号，用于预测代码生成时的逻辑有效性，从而为代码验证提供了一种新的内部自省方法。

Abstract: Current paradigms for code verification rely heavily on external mechanisms-such as execution-based unit tests or auxiliary LLM judges-which are often labor-intensive or limited by the judging model's own capabilities. This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic. These findings establish internal introspection as a decodable property for verifying generated code. Our code is at https:// github.com/bruno686/CodeCircuit.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个物理一致性的自动建筑建模框架，通过CivilInstruct数据集和两阶段微调策略显著减少了不符合工程约束的输出，并通过MBEval基准验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Structural modeling is a fundamental component of computational engineering science, in which even minor physical inconsistencies or specification violations may invalidate downstream simulations. The potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatic generation of modeling code has been demonstrated. However, non-executable or physically inconsistent outputs remain prevalent under stringent engineering constraints. A framework for physics-consistent automatic building modeling is therefore proposed, integrating domain knowledge construction, constraint-oriented model alignment, and verification-driven evaluation. CivilInstruct is introduced as a domain-specific dataset that formalizes structural engineering knowledge and constraint reasoning to enable simulation-ready model generation. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy is further employed to enforce constraint satisfaction and application programming interface compliance, substantially reducing hallucinated and non-conforming outputs. MBEval is presented as a verification-driven benchmark that evaluates executability and structural dynamics consistency through closed-loop validation. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baselines across rigorous verification metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jovanqing/AutoBM.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）在领域特定的企业环境中的有效性，尤其是在需要同时处理检索和修改任务的情况下。

Method: 本文评估了三种RAG变体（标准RAG、Self-RAG和CoRAG）在SQL查询生成、REST API调用生成及动态任务分类中的表现，使用了SAP Transactional Banking作为实际案例。

Result: 结果显示，RAG显著提升了执行准确率（最高达79.30%）和组件匹配准确率（最高达78.86%）。CoRAG在混合文档设置中表现最佳，SQL生成性能显著优于标准RAG（15.32% vs. 11.56%）。

Conclusion: 检索增强生成（RAG）在领域特定的企业环境中至关重要，尤其是在处理联合任务时。CoRAG在混合文档设置中表现最为稳健，显著提升了SQL生成性能。

Abstract: Enterprise systems increasingly require natural language interfaces that can translate user requests into structured operations such as SQL queries and REST API calls. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for code generation [Chen et al., 2021; Huynh and Lin, 2025], their effectiveness in domain-specific enterprise contexts remains underexplored, particularly when both retrieval and modification tasks must be handled jointly. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) variants [Lewis et al., 2021] -- standard RAG, Self-RAG [Asai et al., 2024], and CoRAG [Wang et al., 2025] -- across SQL query generation, REST API call generation, and a combined task requiring dynamic task classification. Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%). Critically, CoRAG proves most robust in hybrid documentation settings, achieving statistically significant improvements in the combined task (10.29% exact match vs. 7.45% for standard RAG), driven primarily by superior SQL generation performance (15.32% vs. 11.56%). Our findings establish retrieval-policy design as a key determinant of production-grade natural language interfaces, showing that iterative query decomposition outperforms both top-k retrieval and binary relevance filtering under documentation heterogeneity.

Abstract: Teaching microservice architectures is challenging due to distributed complexity and the gap between academia and industry. Understanding the quality issues students introduce in MSAs is essential to improve education. This study analyzes student-developed microservices using an established anti-pattern taxonomy and derives lessons learned with actionable teaching recommendations. We conducted a longitudinal, project-based course (2023-2025) involving 216 Master's students (67 teams) who designed and deployed a realistic, containerized MSA for a gamified testing platform. The final systems revealed 23 out of 58 known MSA anti-patterns, spanning five categories. Security issues were most frequent, highlighting weaknesses in authentication, authorization, and data protection. Team Organization and Service Interaction problems followed, reflecting limited DevOps experience and difficulties in inter-service coordination. Fewer issues appeared in Intra-service Design and Inter-service Decomposition, suggesting students generally defined service boundaries well. Overall, students prioritized feature delivery over robustness and operational discipline. To address this, we recommend enforcing minimal standards (API contracts, gateways), providing labs on resilient communication, integrating security-by-design practices, and offering CI-CD templates. The paper contributes a realistic, full-scale educational experience and a replicable model for teaching industry-aligned microservice architecture.

Motivation: 需求中的结构复杂性尚未被充分理解和量化，而需求是系统设计的根本驱动力，其复杂性会贯穿架构、实现和集成阶段。

Method: 基于自然语言处理（NLP）方法从文本需求中提取结构网络，并通过分子集成任务作为结构同构代理进行对照实验。

Result: 谱度量预测集成工作量的相关性超过0.95，结构度量的相关性超过0.89，而基于密度的度量则无显著预测效度。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了架构复杂性分析与需求工程实践之间的方法论空白，为将谱度量应用于需求工程提供了验证基础，其中类似的结构复杂性模式可能预测集成工作量。

Abstract: Complexity in engineered systems presents one of the most persistent challenges in modern development since it is driving cost overruns, schedule delays, and outright project failures. Yet while architectural complexity has been studied, the structural complexity embedded within requirements specifications remains poorly understood and inadequately quantified. This gap is consequential: requirements fundamentally drive system design, and complexity introduced at this stage propagates through architecture, implementation, and integration. To address this gap, we build on Natural Language Processing methods that extract structural networks from textual requirements. Using these extracted structures, we conducted a controlled experiment employing molecular integration tasks as structurally isomorphic proxies for requirements integration - leveraging the topological equivalence between molecular graphs and requirement networks while eliminating confounding factors such as domain expertise and semantic ambiguity. Our results demonstrate that spectral measures predict integration effort with correlations exceeding 0.95, while structural metrics achieve correlations above 0.89. Notably, density-based metrics show no significant predictive validity. These findings indicate that eigenvalue-derived measures capture cognitive and effort dimensions that simpler connectivity metrics cannot. As a result, this research bridges a critical methodological gap between architectural complexity analysis and requirements engineering practice, providing a validated foundation for applying these metrics to requirements engineering, where similar structural complexity patterns may predict integration effort.

Motivation: 环境侵蚀导致许多已发布的机器学习工程笔记本在现代环境中无法复现，阻碍了代码重用和科学进步。

Method: 设计并实现了MLEModernizer，一个基于LLM的代理框架，通过迭代执行笔记本、收集执行反馈并应用针对性修复（错误修复、运行时优化和分数校准）。

Result: 在7,402个无法复现的笔记本中，MLEModernizer成功修复了5,492个（74.2%）。

Conclusion: MLEModernizer成功解决了机器学习工程笔记本的环境侵蚀问题，通过现代化代码修复，显著提高了笔记本的复现性（74.2%）。

Abstract: Interactive computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) are widely used in machine learning engineering (MLE) to program and share end-to-end pipelines, from data preparation to model training and evaluation. However, environment erosion-the rapid evolution of hardware and software ecosystems for machine learning-has rendered many published MLE notebooks non-reproducible in contemporary environments, hindering code reuse and scientific progress. To quantify this gap, we study 12,720 notebooks mined from 79 popular Kaggle competitions: only 35.4% remain reproducible today. Crucially, we find that environment backporting, i.e., downgrading dependencies to match the submission time, does not improve reproducibility but rather introduces additional failure modes.
  To address environment erosion, we design and implement MLEModernizer, an LLM-driven agentic framework that treats the contemporary environment as a fixed constraint and modernizes notebook code to restore reproducibility. MLEModernizer iteratively executes notebooks, collects execution feedback, and applies targeted fixes in three types: error-repair, runtime-reduction, and score-calibration. Evaluated on 7,402 notebooks that are non-reproducible under the baseline environment, MLEModernizer makes 5,492 (74.2%) reproducible. MLEModernizer enables practitioners to validate, reuse, and maintain MLE artifacts as the hardware and software ecosystems continue to evolve.

Motivation: 探索如何通过高质量训练信号内化仓库级代码编辑能力，减少对复杂代理框架的依赖。

Method: 提出Clean-PR训练范式，利用真实GitHub拉取请求作为训练信号，通过重构和验证将嘈杂的拉取请求差异转换为搜索/替换编辑块，并进行中期训练和代理无监督微调。

Result: 在SWE-bench上显著优于基线模型，绝对提升13.6%（Lite）和12.3%（Verified）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过高质量的Clean-PR训练信号，模型能够有效内化仓库级代码理解和编辑能力，无需依赖复杂的推理时框架。

Abstract: Repository-level code editing requires models to understand complex dependencies and execute precise multi-file modifications across a large codebase. While recent gains on SWE-bench rely heavily on complex agent scaffolding, it remains unclear how much of this capability can be internalised via high-quality training signals. To address this, we propose Clean Pull Request (Clean-PR), a mid-training paradigm that leverages real-world GitHub pull requests as a training signal for repository-level editing. We introduce a scalable pipeline that converts noisy pull request diffs into Search/Replace edit blocks through reconstruction and validation, resulting in the largest publicly available corpus of 2 million pull requests spanning 12 programming languages. Using this training signal, we perform a mid-training stage followed by an agentless-aligned supervised fine-tuning process with error-driven data augmentation. On SWE-bench, our model significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned baseline, achieving absolute improvements of 13.6% on SWE-bench Lite and 12.3% on SWE-bench Verified. These results demonstrate that repository-level code understanding and editing capabilities can be effectively internalised into model weights under a simplified, agentless protocol, without relying on heavy inference-time scaffolding.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过自动化测试框架分析18个网站的HTTP流量，发现API调用质量差异显著，冗余请求和缺失缓存头是主要问题，第三方依赖普遍过高，并提供了开源工具和匿名化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络应用严重依赖客户端API调用来获取数据、渲染内容和与后端服务通信，但这些网络交互的质量（如冗余请求、缺失缓存头、过大负载和过多的第三方依赖）很少被系统化测试，且这些质量缺陷往往带有安全隐患。

Method: 通过Playwright进行自动化浏览器检测，记录18个生产网站的完整HTTP流量，生成108个HAR文件，并应用8种基于启发式的反模式检测器，为每个网站生成综合质量评分（0-100）。

Result: 研究结果显示，质量评分范围广泛：简约的服务器渲染网站得分为100，而内容繁重的商业网站得分低至56.8。冗余API调用和缺失缓存头是最普遍的反模式，各影响67%的网站，72%的网站的第三方开销超过20%。

Conclusion: 本研究为现代网络中的HTTP API调用质量建立了实证基准，并提供了一个可重复的测试框架，供研究人员和从业者应用于自己的应用程序。

Abstract: Modern web applications rely heavily on client-side API calls to fetch data, render content, and communicate with backend services. However, the quality of these network interactions (redundant requests, missing cache headers, oversized payloads, and excessive third-party dependencies) is rarely tested in a systematic way. Moreover, many of these quality deficiencies carry security implications: missing cache headers enable cache poisoning, excessive third-party dependencies expand the supply-chain attack surface, and error responses risk leaking server internals. In this study, we present an automated software testing framework that captures and analyzes the complete HTTP traffic of 18 production websites spanning 11 categories (e-commerce, news, government, developer tools, travel, and more). Using automated browser instrumentation via Playwright, we record 108 HAR (HTTP Archive) files across 3 independent runs per page, then apply 8 heuristic-based anti-pattern detectors to produce a composite quality score (0-100) for each site. Our results reveal a wide quality spectrum: minimalist server-rendered sites achieve perfect scores of 100, while content-heavy commercial sites score as low as 56.8. We identify redundant API calls and missing cache headers as the two most pervasive anti-patterns, each affecting 67% of sites, while third-party overhead exceeds 20% on 72% of sites. One utility site makes 2,684 requests per page load, which is 447x more than the most minimal site. To protect site reputations, all identities are anonymized using category-based pseudonyms. We provide all analysis scripts, anonymized results, and reproducibility instructions as an open artifact. This work establishes an empirical baseline for HTTP API call quality across the modern web and offers a reproducible testing framework that researchers and practitioners can apply to their own applications.

Conclusion: ComPass通过结合对比学习和数据增强技术，显著提升了自动补丁正确性评估的准确性，达到了88.35%，优于现有基线方法APPT。

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) attempts to reduce manual debugging efforts and plays a vital role in software maintenance. Despite remarkable progress, APR is still limited in generating overfitting patches, i.e., patches passing available test suites but incorrect. This issue, known as patch overfitting, has become a key concern in the APR community, with numerous approaches proposed to address it. Very recent work proposes a pre-trained language model (PLM)-based automated patch correctness assessment (APCA) approach, indicating the potential of such PLMs in reasoning about patch correctness. Despite being promising, it is still far from perfect due to various limitations, such as the training paradigm and training dataset. In this paper, we present ComPass, a PLM-based APCA approach that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to address the technical limitations of prior work. Our work is inspired by the opportunity to integrate contrastive learning with recent PLMs in the field of patch correctness assessment, where large-scale labeled patches are difficult to obtain. ComPass utilizes code transformation rules to generate semantic-preserving code snippets for both unlabeled pre-training corpus and labeled fine-tuning patches. ComPass then pre-trains PLMs with contrastive learning, which captures code features with the same semantics but different structures. ComPass finally integrates representation embeddings of patch code snippets and fine-tunes PLMs with a binary classifier jointly to assess patch code correctness. Experimental results on 2274 real-world patches from Defects4J demonstrate that ComPass achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline APPT.

Result: 整合了十个最频繁维度的定义（组织、战略、技术、文化、流程、运营、人员、管理、客户和数据），提供了比以往更广泛和更新的DMMs视角。

Conclusion: 本研究通过整合定义，澄清了数字成熟度模型（DMMs）中最常用的十个维度，为未来的数字转型（DT）提供了更清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: Digital Transformation (DT) initiatives frequently face high failure rates, and while Digital Maturity Models (DMMs) offer potential solutions, they have notable shortcomings. Specifically, there is significant disparity in the dimensions considered relevant, a lack of clarity in their definitions, and uncertainty regarding their components. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of DMMs by proposing integrative definitions of the most frequently used dimensions. Using a Systematic Mapping approach, including automatic search and snowballing techniques, we analyzed 76 DMMs to answer two Research Questions: (RQ1) What are the most frequent dimensions in DMMs? and (RQ2) How are these dimensions described, including their components? We reconcile varying interpretations of the ten most frequent dimensions -- Organization, Strategy, Technology, Culture, Process, Operations, People, Management, Customer, and Data -- and propose integrative definitions for each. Compared to previous analyses, this study provides a broader and more recent perspective on Digital Maturity Models.

Abstract: Quantum computing is increasingly practiced through programming, yet most educational offerings emphasize algorithmic or framework-level use rather than software engineering concerns such as testing, abstraction, tooling, and lifecycle management.
  This paper reports on the design and first offering of a cross-listed undergraduate--graduate course that frames quantum computing through a software engineering lens, focusing on early-stage competence relevant to software engineering practice. The course integrates foundational quantum concepts with software engineering perspectives, emphasizing executable artifacts, empirical reasoning, and trade-offs arising from probabilistic behaviour, noise, and evolving toolchains. Evidence is drawn from instructor observations, student feedback, surveys, and analysis of student work.
  Despite minimal prior exposure to quantum computing, students were able to engage productively with quantum software engineering topics once a foundational understanding of quantum information and quantum algorithms, expressed through executable artifacts, was established. This experience report contributes a modular course design, a scalable assessment model for mixed academic levels, and transferable lessons for software engineering educators developing quantum computing curricula.

Motivation: 由于项目缺乏系统化文档和自动化检测机制，许多架构决策违规未被发现。LLMs的进展为规模化自动化架构推理提供了新可能。

Method: 研究分析了109个GitHub仓库中的980个ADR，采用多模型管道：一个LLM初步筛查潜在决策违规，另外三个LLM独立验证推理。评估了模型间一致性、准确性、精确率和召回率，并辅以专家评估。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效支持代码相关的架构决策合规性验证，但对于依赖部署配置或组织知识的隐式决策，仍需依赖人类专家。

Abstract: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) play a central role in maintaining software architecture quality, yet many decision violations go unnoticed because projects lack both systematic documentation and automated detection mechanisms. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for automating architectural reasoning at scale. We investigated how effectively LLMs can identify decision violations in open-source systems by examining their agreement, accuracy, and inherent limitations. Our study analyzed 980 ADRs across 109 GitHub repositories using a multi-model pipeline in which one LLM primary screens potential decision violations, and three additional LLMs independently validate the reasoning. We assessed agreement, accuracy, precision, and recall, and complemented the quantitative findings with expert evaluation. The models achieved substantial agreement and strong accuracy for explicit, code-inferable decisions. Accuracy falls short for implicit or deployment-oriented decisions that depend on deployment configuration or organizational knowledge. Therefore, LLMs can meaningfully support validation of architectural decision compliance; however, they are not yet replacing human expertise for decisions not focused on code.

This paper proposes the Human-AI Integration Framework (HAIF): a protocol-based, scalable operational system built around four core principles, a formal delegation decision model, tiered autonomy with quantifiable transition criteria, and feedback mechanisms designed to integrate into existing Agile and Kanban workflows without requiring additional roles for small teams. The framework is developed following a Design Science Research methodology. HAIF explicitly addresses the central adoption paradox: the more capable AI becomes, the harder it is to justify the oversight the framework demands-and yet the greater the consequences of not providing it. The paper includes domain-specific validation checklists, adaptation guidance for non-software environments, and an examination of the framework's structural limitations-including the increasingly common pattern of continuous human-AI co-production that challenges the discrete delegation model. The framework is tool-agnostic and designed for iterative adoption. Empirical validation is identified as future work.

TL;DR: CWMs的局限性源于密集状态和字符串处理的挑战，错误动作生成长时程行为中的主要问题。改进方向包括更高效的监督和状态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管代码世界模型（CWMs）通过预测运行时状态提供了一种替代自然语言链式推理的方法，但其错误来源和局限性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 研究从局部语义执行和长时程状态跟踪两个互补视角分析CWMs，使用真实代码基准和受控排列跟踪基准进行实验。

Result: 研究发现两种主要失败模式：密集运行时状态导致令牌预算耗尽，字符串值状态错误主要源于子词标记化的限制。长时程行为中，错误动作生成是状态退化的主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究发现，代码世界模型（CWMs）的局限性主要源于密集运行时状态和字符串值状态的挑战，以及长时程行为中的错误动作生成。这为未来改进CWMs的监督和状态表示提供了方向。

Abstract: Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.

TL;DR: Transformer 在日志解析中表现最佳，Mamba 是资源受限时的优选；字符级标记化提升性能，序列长度影响小；研究为实践提供了明确指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动日志解析因异构日志格式、训练与部署数据的分布偏移以及基于规则方法的脆弱性而具有挑战性，本研究旨在系统评估序列建模架构、表示选择、序列长度和训练数据可用性对性能和计算成本的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验比较了四种序列建模架构：Transformer、Mamba state-space、单向 LSTM 和双向 LSTM 模型。共训练了396个模型，使用相对 Levenshtein 编辑距离进行统计显著性测试。

Result: Transformer 的平均相对编辑距离最低（0.111），其次是 Mamba（0.145）、单向 LSTM（0.186）和双向 LSTM（0.265）。Mamba 在计算成本显著降低的同时保持了竞争力。字符级标记化普遍提升性能，序列长度对 Transformer 精度影响可忽略，Mamba 和 Transformer 的样本效率均优于循环模型。

Conclusion: Transformers 在自动日志解析中表现最佳，错误率降低了23.4%，而 Mamba 在数据或计算资源受限时是一个强有力的替代方案。研究结果还阐明了表示选择、序列长度和样本效率的作用，为研究者和实践者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Log parsing is a critical standard operating procedure in software systems, enabling monitoring, anomaly detection, and failure diagnosis. However, automated log parsing remains challenging due to heterogeneous log formats, distribution shifts between training and deployment data, and the brittleness of rule-based approaches. This study aims to systematically evaluate how sequence modelling architecture, representation choice, sequence length, and training data availability influence automated log parsing performance and computational cost. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing four sequence modelling architectures: Transformer, Mamba state-space, monodirectional LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models. In total, 396 models are trained across multiple dataset configurations and evaluated using relative Levenshtein edit distance with statistical significance testing. Transformer achieves the lowest mean relative edit distance (0.111), followed by Mamba (0.145), mono-LSTM (0.186), and bi-LSTM (0.265), where lower values are better. Mamba provides competitive accuracy with substantially lower computational cost. Character-level tokenization generally improves performance, sequence length has negligible practical impact on Transformer accuracy, and both Mamba and Transformer demonstrate stronger sample efficiency than recurrent models. Overall, Transformers reduce parsing error by 23.4%, while Mamba is a strong alternative under data or compute constraints. These results also clarify the roles of representation choice, sequence length, and sample efficiency, providing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: LintCFG利用DSL和LLM自动生成linter配置，显著提升效率，适用于多种语言和linter。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动配置linter复杂且依赖专业知识，且编程语言、编码标准和linter的多样性导致重复和维护工作量大。

Method: 设计了一种DSL来表达编码规则，并通过编译过程将自然语言编码标准转换为DSL编码标准，进而生成特定linter的配置。

Result: 实验显示，LintCFG在DSL表示上达到90%以上的精确率和召回率，在linter配置生成中各项指标接近或超过70%，且在某些方面优于基线方法100%。

Conclusion: LintCFG通过DSL驱动和LLM编译方法，显著提高了linter配置生成的自动化水平，减少了人工干预，并在多语言和多linter环境中展现出广泛适用性。

Abstract: Coding standards are essential for maintaining consistent and high-quality code across teams and projects. Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters.

Motivation: 在软件维护工作中，识别需要修改或删除的模块是关键，而评估模块的执行状态是重要手段之一。

Method: 通过定义软件空间数据集，并基于模块调用关系将软件内部结构视为空间，应用空间统计方法进行空间聚类可视化和统计测试。

Result: 展示了空间统计方法在软件工程中的实用性，并提出了未来挑战。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了空间统计在软件工程领域的应用潜力，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: In software maintenance work, software architects and programmers need to identify modules that require modification or deletion. Whilst user requests and bug reports are utilised for this purpose, evaluating the execution status of modules within the software is also crucial. This paper, therefore, applies spatial statistics to assess internal software execution data. First, we define a software space dataset, viewing the software's internal structure as a space based on module call relationships. Then, using spatial statistics, we conduct the visualization of spatial clusters and the statistical testing using spatial measures. Finally, we consider the usefulness of spatial statistics in the software engineering domain and future challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化软件环境设置在测试和复现故障中至关重要，但现有方法依赖弱信号评估，无法确保项目实际可运行。

Method: 提出了环境成熟度层次结构，并基于此开发了HerAgent方法，通过逐步构建可执行环境并进行验证与修复。

Result: HerAgent在四个公开基准测试中表现最佳，最高提升79.6%，在复杂C/C++项目中领先66.7%，且解决了11-30个其他方法无法配置的环境实例。

Conclusion: HerAgent通过基于执行的验证和修复，显著提升了自动化环境设置的成熟度和成功率，尤其在复杂C/C++项目中表现突出。

Abstract: Automated software environment setup is a prerequisite for testing, debugging, and reproducing failures, yet remains challenging in practice due to complex dependencies, heterogeneous build systems, and incomplete documentation. Recent work leverages large language models to automate this process, but typically evaluates success using weak signals such as dependency installation or partial test execution, which do not ensure that a project can actually run. In this paper, we argue that environment setup success should be evaluated through executable evidence rather than a single binary signal. We introduce the Environment Maturity Hierarchy, which defines three success levels based on progressively stronger execution requirements, culminating in successful execution of a project's main entry point. Guided by this hierarchy, we propose HerAgent, an automated environment setup approach that incrementally constructs executable environments through execution-based validation and repair. We evaluate HerAgent on four public benchmarks, where it outperforms all related work, achieving up to 79.6\% improvement due to its holistic understanding of project structure and dependencies. On complex C/C++ projects, HerAgent surpasses prior approaches by 66.7\%. In addition, HerAgent uniquely resolves 11-30 environment instances across the benchmarks that no prior method can configure.

TL;DR: 传统代码复杂度指标与LLM性能无关，新提出的LM-CC指标基于语义非线性设计，实验证明其更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究传统代码复杂度指标是否能有效表征LLM处理代码时的困难，发现其与LLM性能无一致相关性，因此需要设计更适配的指标。

Method: 通过将程序基于熵分解为语义单元，构建组合层次结构，并量化组合层级和分支引起的分歧，以捕捉代码处理过程中的累积模型不确定性。

Result: LM-CC与传统指标相比，与LLM性能的相关性更强，且降低LM-CC可直接提升任务性能。

Conclusion: 传统代码复杂度指标（如圈复杂度）与大型语言模型（LLM）处理代码时的实际困难不匹配，因此提出了LM-CC这一新指标，其基于程序语义的非线性特性设计，能更准确地反映LLM的感知难度，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity have long been used to assess software quality and maintainability. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) on code understanding and generation tasks, an important yet underexplored question arises: do these traditional complexity metrics meaningfully characterize the difficulty LLMs experience when processing code? In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, after controlling for code length, classical metrics exhibit no consistent correlation with LLM performance, revealing a fundamental mismatch with model-perceived difficulty. To address this gap, we propose LM-CC, a novel code complexity metric designed from the perspective of LLMs. The core premise of LM-CC is that LLM-perceived difficulty is driven by the nonlinearity of program semantics. Accordingly, we decompose programs into semantic units based on entropy, organize these units into a compositional hierarchy, and quantify complexity as a principled aggregation of compositional level and branching-induced divergence, capturing cumulative model uncertainty during code processing. Our extensive experiments show that LM-CC not only correlates more strongly with LLM performance than traditional metrics but also that lowering it directly enhances task performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动应用的快速增长，用户对隐私的关注日益突出，但之前的研究未能全面展示Android应用日志中的隐私泄露情况。

Method: 构建了一个全面的Android应用日志数据集，并进行了实证研究，分析了隐私泄露的现状和严重性。

Result: 研究发现开发者对软件日志隐私问题的五种不同关注类别，以及Android应用日志中隐私泄露的普遍性，主要源于开发者对此类泄露的无意识。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了Android应用日志中隐私泄露的普遍性，并提出了保护隐私的建议。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of mobile apps, users' concerns about their privacy have become increasingly prominent. Android app logs serve as crucial computer resources, aiding developers in debugging and monitoring the status of Android apps, while also containing a wealth of software system information. Previous studies have acknowledged privacy leaks in software logs and Android apps as significant issues without providing a comprehensive view of the privacy leaks in Android app logs. In this study, we build a comprehensive dataset of Android app logs and conduct an empirical study to analyze the status and severity of privacy leaks in Android app logs. Our study comprises three aspects: (1) Understanding real-world developers' concerns regarding privacy issues related to software logs; (2) Studying privacy leaks in the Android app logs; (3) Investigating the characteristics of privacy-leaking Android app logs and analyzing the reasons behind them. Our study reveals five different categories of concerns from real-world developers regarding privacy issues related to software logs and the prevalence of privacy leaks in Android app logs, with the majority stemming from developers' unawareness of such leaks. Additionally, our study provides developers with suggestions to safeguard their privacy from being logged.

TL;DR: 研究发现，代理编写的测试在自主软件工程任务中效用有限，测试编写频率和类型对问题解决效率影响不大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代理编写的测试是否真正提高了问题解决效率，还是仅仅模仿人类测试实践并消耗大量交互预算。

Method: 通过实证研究分析六种最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）在SWE-bench Verified上的代理轨迹，并进行控制实验，修改四个代理的提示以增加或减少测试编写。

Result: 结果显示，测试编写频率在解决和未解决的任务中相似，且测试通常作为观察反馈渠道，而非正式的基于断言的检查。控制实验表明，测试编写量的变化对最终结果影响不大。

Conclusion: 当前的研究表明，在自主软件工程任务中，代理编写的测试可能提供的边际效用有限。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) code agents increasingly resolve repository-level issues by iteratively editing code, invoking tools, and validating candidate patches. In these workflows, agents often write tests on the fly, a paradigm adopted by many high-ranking agents on the SWE-bench leaderboard. However, we observe that GPT-5.2, which writes almost no new tests, can even achieve performance comparable to top-ranking agents. This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.
  To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes. Taken together, our study reveals that current test-writing practices may provide marginal utility in autonomous software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Agent skills extend large language model (LLM) agents with reusable, program-like modules that define triggering conditions, procedural logic, and tool interactions. As these skills proliferate in public marketplaces, it is unclear what types are available, how users adopt them, and what risks they pose. To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40,285 publicly listed skills from a major marketplace. Our results show that skill publication tends to occur in short bursts that track shifts in community attention. We also find that skill content is highly concentrated in software engineering workflows, while information retrieval and content creation account for a substantial share of adoption. Beyond content trends, we uncover a pronounced supply-demand imbalance across categories, and we show that most skills remain within typical prompt budgets despite a heavy-tailed length distribution. Finally, we observe strong ecosystem homogeneity, with widespread intent-level redundancy, and we identify non-trivial safety risks, including skills that enable state-changing or system-level actions. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative snapshot of agent skills as an emerging infrastructure layer for agents and inform future work on skill reuse, standardization, and safety-aware design.

Abstract: Over twenty years ago, the Software Engineering (SE) research community have been involved with Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE). EBSE aims to inform industrial practice with the best evidence from rigorous research, preferably from systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Since then, SE researchers have conducted many SLRs, perfected their SLR procedures, proposed alternative ways of presenting their results (such as Evidence Briefings), and profusely discussed how to conduct research that impacts practice. Nevertheless, there is still a feeling that SLRs' results are not reaching practitioners. Something is missing. In this vision paper, we introduce Evidence to Decision (EtD) frameworks from the health sciences, which propose gathering experts in panels to assess the existing best evidence about the impact of an intervention in all relevant outcomes and make structured recommendations based on them. The insight we can leverage from EtD frameworks is not their structure per se but all the relevant criteria for making recommendations to practitioners from SLRs. Furthermore, we provide a worked example based on an SE SLR. We also discuss the challenges the SE research and practice community may face when adopting EtD frameworks, highlighting the need for more comprehensive criteria in our recommendations to industry practitioners.

Abstract: Developing software globally using outsourced resources has become a common practice, with project teams often distributed in different time zones. In this study, we focus on customers that contract software development to vendors in temporally nearshore or far offshore locations. We conducted a survey to determine the effect of temporal distance on overall success, costs, project management effort, schedule, quality, communication problems, and other outcomes of interest to managers. In the survey of 80 customers and interviews with 6 of them, we also investigated the effect of software development methodology on the same outcomes. The results show that nearshore development is advantageous for overall success, quality, reduced PM effort, maintaining schedule, higher quality, and engendering fewer communication problems. Development methodology appears to only influence higher costs. We assess our findings in the context of prior GSE research and provide practical advice for customers of outsourced global software development, chief of which is to favor nearshore for communication-intensive or Agile projects.

Conclusion: 整合代码度量作为辅助信号可以显著提升自动化文档生成的准确性和上下文相关性，尤其是在CNN-RNN和LLM架构中表现突出。

Abstract: Effective code documentation is essential for collaboration, comprehension, and long-term software maintainability, yet developers often neglect it due to its repetitive nature. Automated documentation generation has evolved from heuristic and rule-based methods to neural network-based and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing methods often overlook structural and quantitative characteristics of code that influence readability and comprehension. Prior research suggests that code metrics capture information relevant to program understanding. Building on these insights, this paper investigates the role of source code metrics as auxiliary signals for automated documentation generation, focusing on computational notebooks, a popular medium among data scientists that integrates code, narrative, and results but suffers from inconsistent documentation. We propose a two-stage approach. First, the CodeSearchNet dataset construction process was refined to create a specialized dataset from over 17 million code and markdown cells. After structural and semantic filtering, approximately 36,734 high-quality (code, markdown) pairs were extracted. Second, two modeling paradigms, a lightweight CNN-RNN architecture and a few-shot GPT-3.5 architecture, were evaluated with and without metric information. Results show that incorporating code metrics improves the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated documentation, yielding gains of 6% in BLEU-1 and 3% in ROUGE-L F1 for CNN-RNN-based architecture, and 9% in BERTScore F1 for LLM-based architecture. These findings demonstrate that integrating code metrics provides valuable structural context, enhancing automated documentation generation across diverse model families.

Result: 在Defects4J数据集上，缺陷检测率提升8.56%（相比最佳LLM方法）和63.30%（相比EvoSuite），同时提高了行和分支覆盖率。

Conclusion: AdverTest通过对抗性框架显著提升了测试覆盖率和缺陷检测能力，优于现有基于LLM的方法和EvoSuite。

Abstract: Software testing is a critical, yet resource-intensive phase of the software development lifecycle. Over the years, various automated tools have been developed to aid in this process. Search-based approaches typically achieve high coverage but produce tests with low readability, whereas large language model (LLM)-based methods generate more human-readable tests but often suffer from low coverage and compilability. While the majority of research efforts have focused on improving test coverage and readability, little attention has been paid to enhancing the robustness of bug detection, particularly in exposing corner cases and vulnerable execution paths. To address this gap, we propose AdverTest, a novel adversarial framework for LLM-powered test case generation. AdverTest comprises two interacting agents: a test case generation agent (T) and a mutant generation agent (M). These agents engage in an adversarial loop, where M persistently creates new mutants "hacking" the blind spots of T's current test suite, while T iteratively refines its test cases to "kill" the challenging mutants produced by M. This interaction loop is guided by both coverage and mutation scores, enabling the system to co-evolve toward both high test coverage and bug detection capability. Experimental results in the Defects4J dataset show that our approach improves fault detection rates by 8.56% over the best existing LLM-based methods and by 63.30% over EvoSuite, while also improving line and branch coverage.

Abstract: Microservice architectures encourage the use of small, independently developed services; however, this can lead to increased architectural complexity. Accurate documentation is crucial, but is challenging to maintain due to the rapid, independent evolution of services. While static architecture reconstruction provides a way to maintain up-to-date documentation, existing approaches suffer from technology limitations, mono-repo constraints, or high implementation barriers. This paper presents a novel framework for static architecture reconstruction that supports technology-specific analysis modules, called \emph{extractors}, and supports \emph{distributed architecture reconstruction} in multi-repo environments. We describe the core design concepts and algorithms that govern how extractors are executed, how data is passed between them, and how their outputs are unified. Furthermore, the framework is interoperable with existing static analysis tools and algorithms, allowing them to be invoked from or embedded within extractors.

Method: 提出并评估ModARO方法，支持为任何技术编写模块化重建代码（'提取器'），并跨项目重用。

Result: 通过配置ModARO重建10个开源项目，并在用户研究中验证其有效性和可用性。

Conclusion: ModARO提供了一种模块化的方法，允许开发者根据技术栈定制提取器，并跨仓库分发架构重建，便于集成到CI/CD管道中。

Abstract: Microservice architectures promote small, independently developed services, but increase overall architectural complexity. It is crucial that developers understand the architecture and how changes to a service affect the overall system, but rapid and independent development of services increases the risk of architectural drift and discourages the creation and maintenance of documentation. Automatic architecture reconstruction can help avoid these issues, but it is difficult to reuse reconstruction code across multiple projects, as all use different combinations of technologies and project-specific conventions. Reconstruction of architecture-level details is further complicated by the tendency to split microservices into separate repositories, preventing a full view of the system from any one codebase. In this paper, we present and evaluate ModARO, an approach to microservice architecture reconstruction that allows writing modular reconstruction code ('extractors') for any technologies and reusing them across different projects, independent of the surrounding technology stack or whether or not the services are split into multiple codebases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by configuring ModARO to reconstruct 10 open source projects, and we validate the usefulness and usability of ModARO against a state-of-the-art baseline in a user study with 8 industry practitioners. Using this approach, developers can assemble or create extractors tailored to their technology stacks and distribute architecture reconstruction across repositories, enabling integration into repository CI/CD pipelines.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了LLM在Scrum管理中的应用，发现高熟练度和频繁使用，主要收益为生产力和效率提升，但也存在输出准确性、保密性和幻觉等风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Scrum因其适应性和协作性在软件项目管理中广泛采用，但现有研究多集中于技术活动（如编码和测试），关于LLM在管理相关Scrum活动中应用的证据有限。

Method: 通过对70名巴西专业人员的调查，其中49人积极使用Scrum，33人报告在其Scrum实践中使用基于LLM的助手。

Result: 结果显示，LLM的使用集中在探索Scrum实践上，85%的受访者报告了中高级熟练度，52%每天使用。主要收益包括提高生产力（78%）和减少手动工作（75%），但也存在关键风险，如‘几乎正确’的输出（81%）、保密问题（63%）和使用中的幻觉（59%）。

Conclusion: 本研究首次对LLM在Scrum管理中的应用进行了实证分析，识别了当前实践、量化了收益与风险，并提出了在敏捷环境中负责任采用和整合的方向。

Abstract: Scrum is widely adopted in software project management due to its adaptability and collaborative nature. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities to support knowledge-intensive Scrum practices. However, existing research has largely focused on technical activities such as coding and testing, with limited evidence on the use of LLMs in management-related Scrum activities. In this study, we investigate the use of LLMs in Scrum management activities through a survey of 70 Brazilian professionals. Among them, 49 actively use Scrum, and 33 reported using LLM-based assistants in their Scrum practices. The results indicate a high level of proficiency and frequent use of LLMs, with 85% of respondents reporting intermediate or advanced proficiency and 52% using them daily. LLM use concentrates on exploring Scrum practices, with artifacts and events receiving targeted yet uneven support, whereas broader management tasks appear to be adopted more cautiously. The main benefits include increased productivity (78%) and reduced manual effort (75%). However, several critical risks remain, as respondents report 'almost correct' outputs (81%), confidentiality concerns (63%), and hallucinations during use (59%). This work provides one of the first empirical characterizations of LLM use in Scrum management, identifying current practices, quantifying benefits and risks, and outlining directions for responsible adoption and integration in Agile environments.

*Taohong Zhu,Lucas C. Cordeiro,Mustafa A. Mustafa,Youcheng Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VibeRepair是一种基于行为规范的自动程序修复技术，通过将代码转换为行为规范并修复规范不一致性，显著提升了修复效果和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动程序修复方法多为代码中心式，容易产生行为不一致的修复结果，需要一种更易于LLM理解的表示方式来提升修复准确性。

Method: VibeRepair首先将错误代码转换为结构化行为规范，修复规范中的不一致，最后严格根据修正后的规范合成代码。还包含按需推理组件以增强复杂案例的处理能力。

Result: 在Defects4J v1.2和v2.0基准测试中，VibeRepair分别修复了174和178个错误，性能提升19%和23%。在实际场景中也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VibeRepair通过将修复过程集中在行为规范而非直接代码编辑，显著提升了自动程序修复（APR）的效果，并在多个基准测试中展现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven automated program repair (APR) has advanced rapidly, but most methods remain code-centric: they directly rewrite source code and thereby risk hallucinated, behaviorally inconsistent fixes. This limitation suggests the need for an alternative repair paradigm that relies on a representation more accessible to LLMs than raw code, enabling more accurate understanding, analysis, and alignment during repair. To address this gap, we propose VibeRepair, a specification-centric APR technique that treats repair as behavior-specification repair rather than ad-hoc code editing. VibeRepair first translates buggy code into a structured behavior specification that captures the program's intended runtime behavior, then infers and repairs specification misalignments, and finally synthesizes code strictly guided by the corrected behavior specification. An on-demand reasoning component enriches hard cases with program analysis and historical bug-fix evidence while controlling cost. Across Defects4J and real-world benchmarks and multiple LLMs, VibeRepair demonstrates consistently strong repair effectiveness with a significantly smaller patch space. On Defects4J v1.2, VibeRepair correctly repairs 174 bugs, exceeding the strongest state-of-the-art baseline by 28 bugs, which corresponds to a 19% improvement. On Defects4J v2.0, it repairs 178 bugs, outperforming prior approaches by 33 bugs, representing a 23% improvement. Evaluations on real-world benchmarks collected after the training period of selected LLMs further confirm its effectiveness and generalizability. By centering repair on explicit behavioral intent, VibeRepair reframes APR for the era of "vibe" coding: make the behavior sing, and the code will follow.

TL;DR: SWE-ContextBench基准评估编程代理的经验复用能力，发现正确总结的经验能提高准确率并降低成本，而错误选择的经验效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型作为编程代理用于仓库级软件工程任务时，虽然已有基准评估正确性，但缺乏对代理跨相关问题复用经验的评估。因此，复用经验的能力及其效率提升难以衡量。

Method: 研究团队引入了SWE-ContextBench基准，基于SWE-Bench Lite，扩展了300个基础任务和99个相关任务，形成共享上下文的任务序列。基准从预测准确性、时间效率和成本效率三个维度评估代理。

Result: 正确选择和总结的经验显著提高了任务解决准确率，并大幅降低了运行时间和令牌成本，尤其在较难任务上。未经筛选或错误选择的经验效果有限甚至有害。

Conclusion: 研究发现，正确选择和总结的经验能显著提高任务解决准确率并降低运行时间和成本，特别是在较难任务上。相反，未经筛选或错误选择的经验效果有限甚至有害。这些发现强调了经验表示和检索质量的重要性，并将SWE-ContextBench定位为研究编程代理经验复用的基准。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as programming agents for repository level software engineering tasks. While recent benchmarks evaluate correctness in realistic codebases, they largely treat tasks as independent and do not assess whether agents can reuse experience across related problems. As a result, the ability of agents to accumulate, retrieve, and apply prior experience, as well as the efficiency gains from such reuse, remains difficult to measure. We introduce SWE-ContextBench, a benchmark designed to explicitly evaluate experience reuse in programming agents. Built on SWE-Bench Lite, SWE-ContextBench augments 300 base tasks with 99 related tasks derived from real dependency and reference relationships among GitHub issues and pull requests, forming task sequences with shared context. The benchmark evaluates agents along three complementary dimensions: prediction accuracy, time efficiency, and cost efficiency. Using SWE-ContextBench, we study multiple experience reuse settings, including oracle guided and autonomous retrieval, as well as full execution trajectories and compact summaries. Our results show that correctly selected summarized experience improves resolution accuracy and substantially reduces runtime and token cost, particularly on harder tasks. In contrast, unfiltered or incorrectly selected experience provides limited or negative benefits. These findings highlight the importance of experience representation and retrieval quality, and position SWE-ContextBench as a principled benchmark for studying experience reuse in programming agents.

TL;DR: 研究表明，AI代理能有效自动化修复计算研究中的复制失败，尤其复杂情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨大型语言模型和AI代理是否能自动诊断和修复计算研究中的失败，从而使计算结果更易于复制和验证。

Method: 使用基于提示和基于代理的两种自动化修复工作流程，在干净的Docker环境中测试了五种完全可复制的R-based社会科学研究。

Result: 基于提示的运行复制成功率为31-79%，性能受提示上下文和错误复杂性影响；基于代理的工作流程表现更好，成功率为69-96%。

Conclusion: 自动化工作流程，特别是基于代理的系统，可以显著减少手动工作并提高跨多种错误类型的复制成功率。

Abstract: Reproducing computational research is often assumed to be as simple as rerunning the original code with provided data. In practice, missing packages, fragile file paths, version conflicts, or incomplete logic frequently cause analyses to fail, even when materials are shared. This study investigates whether large language models and AI agents can automate the diagnosis and repair of such failures, making computational results easier to reproduce and verify. We evaluate this using a controlled reproducibility testbed built from five fully reproducible R-based social science studies. Realistic failures were injected, ranging from simple issues to complex missing logic, and two automated repair workflows were tested in clean Docker environments. The first workflow is prompt-based, repeatedly querying language models with structured prompts of varying context, while the second uses agent-based systems that inspect files, modify code, and rerun analyses autonomously. Across prompt-based runs, reproduction success ranged from 31-79 percent, with performance strongly influenced by prompt context and error complexity. Complex cases benefited most from additional context. Agent-based workflows performed substantially better, with success rates of 69-96 percent across all complexity levels. These results suggest that automated workflows, especially agent-based systems, can significantly reduce manual effort and improve reproduction success across diverse error types. Unlike prior benchmarks, our testbed isolates post-publication repair under controlled failure modes, allowing direct comparison of prompt-based and agent-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏严谨的方法评估不同架构选择（如提示、技能、工具、多代理设置）对能力和成本的影响。

Method: 使用七个测试层级（T0-T6）逐步增加复杂性，结合多LLM评委（Opus 4.5、Sonnet 4.5、Haiku 4.5）进行共识评估，通过直接测试、人工设计的LLM评估标准和定性评估来评分。

Result: 提出了一个可重复的评估框架，量化了代理复杂性与实际结果之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Scylla框架通过结构化消融研究和成本效益指标（CoP）量化了代理复杂性对实际结果的影响，表明增加架构复杂性并不总能提高质量。

Abstract: LLM-based tools are automating more software development tasks at a rapid pace, but there is no rigorous way to evaluate how different architectural choices -- prompts, skills, tools, multi-agent setups -- materially affect both capability and cost. This paper introduces Scylla, an evaluation framework for benchmarking agentic coding tools through structured ablation studies that uses seven testing tiers (T0-T6) progressively adding complexity to isolate what directly influences results and how. The key metric is Cost-of-Pass (CoP): the expected dollar cost to get one correct solution, which directly quantifies the trade-off between complexity and efficiency. The framework is model-agnostic, designed to work with any CLI tool; this paper demonstrates it with Claude Sonnet 4.5, using multiple LLM judges (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5) from the same vendor for evaluation consensus, where judges score results using direct tests, human-designed LLM-evaluated rubrics, and qualitative assessment. The result is a reproducible framework that quantifies trade-offs between agent complexity and actual outcomes, suggesting that architectural complexity does not always improve quality.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ArkEval是首个针对ArkTS自动化程序修复的评估框架和基准，通过挖掘华为仓库问题构建502个可复现问题，评估了四种LLM的修复能力，揭示了当前模型的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着HarmonyOS生态的发展，ArkTS作为其核心开发语言缺乏自动化代码修复工具，主要原因是缺少高质量的评估基准。

Method: 通过从华为官方仓库中挖掘400多个独立ArkTS应用的问题，经过多阶段筛选，最终选出502个可复现问题。采用基于LLM的测试生成和投票机制（涉及Claude等模型）确保可测试性，并标准化问题陈述以实现公平评估。

Result: 构建了ArkEval框架和首个ArkTS自动化修复基准，评估了四种先进大型语言模型在检索增强修复工作流中的表现。

Conclusion: ArkEval框架为ArkTS自动化程序修复提供了首个全面基准，评估了当前大型语言模型在修复ArkTS代码方面的能力与局限，为这一低资源语言领域的未来研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models have transformed code generation, enabling unprecedented automation in software development. As mobile ecosystems evolve, HarmonyOS has emerged as a critical platform requiring robust development tools. Software development for the HarmonyOS ecosystem relies heavily on ArkTS, a statically typed extension of TypeScript. Despite its growing importance, the ecosystem lacks robust tools for automated code repair, primarily due to the absence of a high-quality benchmark for evaluation. To address this gap, we present ArkEval, a unified framework for ArkTS automated repair workflow evaluation and benchmark construction. It provides the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for ArkTS automated program repair. We constructed this benchmark by mining issues from a large-scale official Huawei repository containing over 400 independent ArkTS applications. Through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process, we curated 502 reproducible issues. To ensure testability, we employed a novel LLM-based test generation and voting mechanism involving Claude and other models. Furthermore, we standardized problem statements to facilitate fair evaluation. Finally, we evaluated four state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmark using a retrieval-augmented repair workflow. Our results highlight the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in repairing ArkTS code, paving the way for future research in this low-resource language domain.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于GPT-4o的"DeepQuali"方法，用于需求质量评估。专家评估显示LLM在整体评分上表现良好，但详细评分存在差异，且需改进工作流程集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人工智能（GAI）在软件工程中主要用于编码任务，而需求工程（特别是需求验证）的应用有限。当前GAI在需求工程中的重点在于需求获取、转换和分类，而非质量评估。

Method: 提出并评估了基于LLM（GPT-4o）的方法"DeepQuali"，用于敏捷软件开发中的需求质量评估和改进。在两家小公司的项目中应用，并与专家评估进行比较。

Result: 专家基本同意LLM的质量评估，尤其是在整体评分和解释方面。但在详细评分上专家之间并不总是一致，表明专业知识和经验可能影响判断。专家认可该方法的实用性，但批评其缺乏与工作流程的集成。

Conclusion: LLMs在支持软件工程师进行需求质量评估和改进方面显示出潜力，明确使用质量模型和解释性反馈可以提高接受度。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), specifically large language models (LLMs), are increasingly used in software engineering, mainly for coding tasks. However, requirements engineering - particularly requirements validation - has seen limited application of GAI. The current focus of using GAI for requirements is on eliciting, transforming, and classifying requirements, not on quality assessment. We propose and evaluate the LLM-based (GPT-4o) approach "DeepQuali", for assessing and improving requirements quality in agile software development. We applied it to projects in two small companies, where we compared LLM-based quality assessments with expert judgments. Experts also participated in walkthroughs of the solution, provided feedback, and rated their acceptance of the approach. Experts largely agreed with the LLM's quality assessments, especially regarding overall ratings and explanations. However, they did not always agree with the other experts on detailed ratings, suggesting that expertise and experience may influence judgments. Experts recognized the usefulness of the approach but criticized the lack of integration into their workflow. LLMs show potential in supporting software engineers with the quality assessment and improvement of requirements. The explicit use of quality models and explanatory feedback increases acceptance.

Motivation: 尽管AI编码助手在软件开发中的采用迅速增长，但对其在不同任务类型中有效性的系统性比较仍然有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本研究通过分析AIDev数据集中的7,156个PR请求，对五种流行的AI编码助手（OpenAI Codex、GitHub Copilot、Devin、Cursor和Claude Code）进行了实证比较，并进行了时间趋势分析。

Result: Devin在PR接受率上显示出唯一的持续积极趋势（每周+0.77%）。文档任务的接受率最高（82.1%），而新功能任务的接受率较低（66.1%）。OpenAI Codex在所有任务类别中表现一致优异，但Claude Code在文档和功能任务中表现最佳，Cursor在修复任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同AI编码助手在不同任务类型中的表现存在显著差异，且随时间推移表现出不同的趋势。Devin在PR接受率上显示出唯一的持续积极趋势，而OpenAI Codex在多个任务类别中表现优异，但没有单一助手在所有任务类型中表现最佳。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI-powered coding assistants is transforming software development practices, yet systematic comparisons of their effectiveness across different task types and over time remain limited. This paper presents an empirical study comparing five popular agents (OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Devin, Cursor, and Claude Code), analyzing 7,156 pull requests (PRs) from the AIDev dataset. Temporal trend analysis reveals heterogeneous evolution patterns: Devin exhibits the only consistent positive trend in acceptance rate (+0.77% per week over 32 weeks), whereas other agents remain largely stable. Our analysis suggests that the PR task type is a dominant factor influencing acceptance rates: documentation tasks achieve 82.1% acceptance compared to 66.1% for new features - a 16 percentage point gap that exceeds typical inter-agent variance for most tasks. OpenAI Codex achieves consistently high acceptance rates across all nine task categories (59.6%-88.6%), with stratified Chi-square tests confirming statistically significant advantages over other agents in several task categories. However, no single agent performs best across all task types: Claude Code leads in documentation (92.3%) and features (72.6%), while Cursor excels in fix tasks (80.4%).

TL;DR: 提出一种自底向上的凸体分解方法，优化碰撞检测性能，降低复杂度，适用于游戏等高性能需求场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动凸分解方法（如基于凸包的技术）在性能密集型应用（如游戏）中不实用，因其碰撞检测速度慢且难以手动修改。

Method: 采用自底向上的分解策略，将输入网格分解为凸体，灵感来源于四边形网格简化技术，确保生成的碰撞体完全包围输入表面。

Result: 在60多个Sketchfab模型上测试显示，该方法在Hausdorff和Chamfer距离上优于V-HACD和CoACD，且碰撞体复杂度降低三分之二，24个模型的刚体模拟性能均有提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对复杂网格的凸体分解方法，相比现有技术（如V-HACD和CoACD），在碰撞检测性能和模拟效率上表现更优，且生成的碰撞体复杂度更低。

Abstract: Creation of collision objects for 3D models is a time-consuming task, requiring modelers to manually place primitives such as bounding boxes, capsules, spheres, and other convex primitives to approximate complex meshes. While there has been work in automatic approximate convex decompositions of meshes using convex hulls, they are not practical for applications with tight performance budgets such as games due to slower collision detection and inability to manually modify the output while maintaining convexity as compared to manually placed primitives. Rather than convex decomposition with convex hulls, we devise an approach for bottom-up decomposition of an input mesh into convex primitives specifically for rigid body simulation inspired by quadric mesh simplification. This approach fits primitives to complex, real-world meshes that provide plausible simulation performance and are guaranteed to enclose the input surface. We test convex primitive decomposition on over 60 models from Sketchfab, showing the algorithm's effectiveness. On this dataset, convex primitive decomposition has lower one-way mean and median Hausdorff and Chamfer distance from the collider to the input compared to V-HACD and CoACD, with less than one-third of the complexity as measured by total bytes for each collider. On top of that, rigid-body simulation performance measured by wall-clock time is consistently improved across 24 tested models.

Motivation: 旨在加速可变形子空间模拟，提高时间效率，并扩展Koopman基于降阶模型在图形学中的适用性，尤其是在涉及几何变化的任务中。

Method: 使用动态模式分解（DMD）参数化的Koopman算子，学习可变形动力学的时序演化，并通过高效的矩阵评估预测未来状态，避免了顺序时间积分。

Result: 实现了对数线性时间步长缩放，能够跳过大部分轨迹而保持准确性，特别适用于控制和初始状态估计等优化任务。此外，提出了一个离散化无关的扩展，能够学习跨多个形状和网格分辨率的共享动态行为。

Conclusion: 该论文通过低秩Koopman算子公式和动态模式分解（DMD）参数化，提出了一种加速可变形子空间模拟的方法，显著提升了时间效率，并扩展了Koopman基于降阶模型在图形学中的应用范围。

Abstract: We present a low-rank Koopman operator formulation for accelerating deformable subspace simulation. Using a Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) parameterization of the Koopman operator, our method learns the temporal evolution of deformable dynamics and predicts future states through efficient matrix evaluations instead of sequential time integration. This yields log-linear scaling in the number of time steps and allows large portions of the trajectory to be skipped while retaining accuracy. The resulting temporal efficiency is especially advantageous for optimization tasks such as control and initial-state estimation, where the objective often depends largely on the final configuration.
  To broaden the scope of Koopman-based reduced-order models in graphics, we introduce a discretization-agnostic extension that learns shared dynamic behavior across multiple shapes and mesh resolutions. Prior DMD-based approaches have been restricted to a single shape and discretization, which limits their usefulness for tasks involving geometry variation. Our formulation generalizes across both shape and discretization, which enables fast shape optimization that was previously impractical for DMD models. This expanded capability highlights the potential of Koopman operator learning as a practical tool for efficient deformable simulation and design.

Conclusion: TABI方法在保持交互性能的同时，显著减少了图表降尺度，提供了接近离线方法的打包质量。

Abstract: Atlas packing is a key step in many computer graphics applications. Packing algorithms seek to arrange a set of charts within a fixed-size atlas with as little downscaling as possible. Many packing applications such as content creation tools, dynamic atlas generation for video games, and texture space shading require on-the-fly interactive atlas packing. Unfortunately, while many methods have been developed for generating tight high-quality packings, they are designed for offline settings and have running times two or more orders of magnitude greater than what is required for interactive performance. While real-time GPU packing methods exist, they significantly downscale packed charts compared to offline methods. We introduce a GPU packing method that targets interactive speeds, provides packing quality approaching that of offline methods, and supports flexible user control over the tradeoff between performance and quality. We observe that current real-time packing methods leave large gaps between charts and often produce asymmetric, or poorly balanced, packings. These artifacts dramatically degrade packing quality. Our Tight And Balanced method eliminates these artifacts while retaining Interactive performance. TABI generates tight packings by compacting empty space between irregularly shaped charts both horizontally and vertically, using two approximations of chart shape that support efficient parallel processing. We balance packing outputs by automatically adjusting atlas row widths and orientations to accommodate varying chart heights. We show that our method significantly reduces chart downscaling compared to existing interactive methods while remaining orders of magnitude faster than offline alternatives.

Motivation: 传统MPM方法因粒子积分和宽核选择导致性能瓶颈，MPM Lite旨在消除这一瓶颈。

Method: MPM Lite采用混合拉格朗日/欧拉方法，将粒子状态重新采样到固定位置的积分点，避免了粒子访问，从而降低了求解复杂度。

Conclusion: MPM Lite通过创新的应力传递和拉伸重建策略，显著提升了传统MPM方法的性能，同时在隐式和显式设置中均实现了加速。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MPM Lite, a new hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian method that eliminates the need for particle-based quadrature at solve time. Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

In graphics, numerical integrators like implicit Euler and BDF2 are preferred due to their stability at large time steps, but they tend to dissipate energy uncontrollably. In contrast, symplectic methods like implicit midpoint can conserve energy but are not unconditionally stable and fail on moderately stiff problems. To address these limitations, we propose a general class of numerical integrators for Hamiltonian problems which are symplectic on linear problems, yet have superior stability on nonlinear problems. With this, we derive a novel energy-controllable time integrator, A-search, a simple modification of implicit Euler that can follow user-specified energy targets, enabling flexible control over energy dissipation or conservation while maintaining stability and physical fidelity. Our method integrates seamlessly with barrier-type energies and allows for inversion-free and penetration-free guarantees, making it well-suited for handling large deformations and complex collisions. Extensive evaluations over a wide range of material parameters and scenes demonstrate that A-search has biases to keep energy in low frequency motion rather than dissipation, and A-search outperforms traditional methods such as BDF2 at similar total running times by maintaining energy and leading to more visually desirable simulations.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种专为低于1-spp设计的自适应采样和去噪方法，通过随机采样梯度估计和感知优化，显著提升了低采样预算下的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着渲染复杂度、分辨率和帧率要求的提升，实时路径追踪常需在极低采样预算（低于1-spp）下运行。现有超分辨率方法无法充分利用图像中噪声、重建难度和感知重要性的差异。

Method: 论文采用了一种随机采样的梯度估计方法，结合了可微分色调映射操作和先进的感知损失函数，以及基于聚集的金字塔去噪滤波器和可学习的反照率解调方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在极低采样预算下仍能有效工作，显著提升了感知关键细节的重建质量。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的端到端自适应采样和去噪管道在低于1-spp的极低采样预算下表现优异，尤其在感知关键细节（如镜面高光和阴影边界）的重建上优于均匀稀疏采样。

Abstract: Real-time path tracing increasingly operates under extremely low sampling budgets, often below one sample per pixel, as rendering complexity, resolution, and frame-rate requirements continue to rise. While super-resolution is widely used in production, it uniformly sacrifices spatial detail and cannot exploit variations in noise, reconstruction difficulty, and perceptual importance across the image. Adaptive sampling offers a compelling alternative, but existing end-to-end approaches rely on approximations that break down in sparse regimes.
  We introduce an end-to-end adaptive sampling and denoising pipeline explicitly designed for the sub-1-spp regime. Our method uses a stochastic formulation of sample placement that enables gradient estimation despite discrete sampling decisions, allowing stable training of a neural sampler at low sampling budgets. To better align optimization with human perception, we propose a tonemapping-aware training pipeline that integrates differentiable filmic operators and a state-of-the-art perceptual loss, preventing oversampling of regions with low visual impact.
  In addition, we introduce a gather-based pyramidal denoising filter and a learnable generalization of albedo demodulation tailored to sparse sampling. Our results show consistent improvements over uniform sparse sampling, with notably better reconstruction of perceptually critical details such as specular highlights and shadow boundaries, and demonstrate that adaptive sampling remains effective even at minimal budgets.

### [252] [HALO: A Fine-Grained Resource Sharing Quantum Operating System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07191)
*John Zhuoyang Ye,Jiyuan Wang,Yifan Qiao,Jens Palsberg*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: HALO is a quantum OS design that enhances resource-sharing via qubit-sharing and adaptive scheduling, boosting utilization and throughput while preserving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The imbalance between high user demand and scarce quantum resources in cloud-based quantum computing platforms necessitates a more efficient scheduling system.

Method: HALO introduces a hardware-aware qubit-sharing algorithm and a shot-adaptive scheduler to enable fine-grained resource-sharing.

Result: HALO improves hardware utilization by up to 2.44x, increases throughput by 4.44x, and maintains fidelity loss within 33% compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: HALO demonstrates the practicality of resource-sharing in quantum computing by improving hardware utilization and throughput while maintaining fidelity.

Abstract: As quantum computing enters the cloud era, thousands of users must share access to a small number of quantum processors. Users need to wait minutes to days to start their jobs, which only takes a few seconds for execution. Current quantum cloud platforms employ a fair-share scheduler, as there is no way to multiplex a quantum computer among multiple programs at the same time, leaving many qubits idle and significantly under-utilizing the hardware. This imbalance between high user demand and scarce quantum resources has become a key barrier to scalable and cost-effective quantum computing.
  We present HALO, the first quantum operating system design that supports fine-grained resource-sharing. HALO introduces two complementary mechanisms. First, a hardware-aware qubit-sharing algorithm that places shared helper qubits on regions of the quantum computer that minimize routing overhead and avoid cross-talk noise between different users' processes. Second, a shot-adaptive scheduler that allocates execution windows according to each job's sampling requirements, improving throughput and reducing latency. Together, these mechanisms transform the way quantum hardware is scheduled and achieve more fine-grained parallelism.
  We evaluate HALO on the IBM Torino quantum computer on helper qubit intense benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art systems such as HyperQ, HALO improves overall hardware utilization by up to 2.44x, increasing throughput by 4.44x, and maintains fidelity loss within 33%, demonstrating the practicality of resource-sharing in quantum computing.

TL;DR: 论文提出分支上下文，通过BranchFS和branch()系统调用为AI代理提供高效隔离环境，实现快速分支创建和原子提交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理在并行探索多路径时对隔离环境和原子操作的需求。

Method: 结合BranchFS（基于FUSE的文件系统）和branch()系统调用，实现分支上下文的四大功能：状态隔离、结构化生命周期、首次提交优先解决和嵌套上下文。

Result: 初步评估显示，BranchFS的分支创建时间低于350微秒，提交开销与修改规模成正比（小修改下低于1毫秒）。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为分支上下文的新操作系统抽象，通过BranchFS和branch()系统调用实现，为AI代理提供了高效的隔离环境和原子提交/回滚机制。

Abstract: AI agents increasingly perform agentic exploration: pursuing multiple solution paths in parallel and committing only the successful one. Because each exploration path may modify files and spawn processes, agents require isolated environments with atomic commit and rollback semantics for both filesystem state and process state. We introduce the branch context, a new OS abstraction that provides: (1) copy-on-write state isolation with independent filesystem views and process groups, (2) a structured lifecycle of fork, explore, and commit/abort, (3) first-commit-wins resolution that automatically invalidates sibling branches, and (4) nestable contexts for hierarchical exploration. We realize branch contexts in Linux through two complementary components. First, BranchFS is a FUSE-based filesystem that gives each branch context an isolated copy-on-write workspace, with O(1) creation, atomic commit to the parent, and automatic sibling invalidation, all without root privileges. BranchFS is open sourced in https://github.com/multikernel/branchfs. Second, branch() is a proposed Linux syscall that spawns processes into branch contexts with reliable termination, kernel-enforced sibling isolation, and first-commit-wins coordination. Preliminary evaluation of BranchFS shows sub-350 us branch creation independent of base filesystem size, and modification-proportional commit overhead (under 1 ms for small changes).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存扩展通过CXL是一种以较低成本和功耗提供额外内存的有效方式，但现有分层解决方案在生产部署中存在多租户支持不足、控制平面灵活性有限和可观察性不足等问题。

Method: Equilibria提供了每容器的内存公平共享分配控制和分层内存使用及操作的细粒度可观察性。它通过调节的晋升和降级强制执行灵活的用户指定公平策略，并通过抑制抖动来减轻嘈杂邻居干扰。

Result: 在大型超大规模生产工作负载和基准测试中，Equilibria帮助工作负载满足服务级别目标（SLO），同时避免性能干扰。相比最先进的Linux解决方案TPP，Equilibria在生产工作负载中性能提升高达52%，在基准测试中提升1.7倍。

Conclusion: Equilibria是一个操作系统框架，能够在数据中心规模上实现公平、多租户的CXL分层。它通过每容器控制和细粒度可观察性优化内存分配，并通过灵活的用户指定公平策略减少性能干扰。所有Equilibria补丁已发布给Linux社区。

Abstract: Memory dominates datacenter system cost and power. Memory expansion via Compute Express Link (CXL) is an effective way to provide additional memory at lower cost and power, but its effective use requires software-level tiering for hyperscaler workloads. Existing tiering solutions, including current Linux support, face fundamental limitations in production deployments. First, they lack multi-tenancy support, failing to handle stacked homogeneous or heterogeneous workloads. Second, limited control-plane flexibility leads to fairness violations and performance variability. Finally, insufficient observability prevents operators from diagnosing performance pathologies at scale.
  We present Equilibria, an OS framework enabling fair, multi-tenant CXL tiering at datacenter scale. Equilibria provides per-container controls for memory fair-share allocation and fine-grained observability of tiered-memory usage and operations. It further enforces flexible, user-specified fairness policies through regulated promotion and demotion, and mitigates noisy-neighbor interference by suppressing thrashing.
  Evaluated in a large hyperscaler fleet using production workloads and benchmarks, Equilibria helps workloads meet service level objectives (SLOs) while avoiding performance interference. It improves performance over the state-of-the-art Linux solution, TPP, by up to 52% for production workloads and 1.7x for benchmarks. All Equilibria patches have been released to the Linux community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有V2X性能评估多依赖模拟器生成的合成交通场景，可能无法完全反映真实交通特征，因此需要基于真实交通数据集的大规模评估。

Method: 利用HighD和InD数据集中的真实交通轨迹，转换为仿真格式，结合标准化V2X网络堆栈，对超过十万辆车辆进行消息级性能分析。

Result: 评估了高速公路和城市交叉口环境下的关键V2X性能指标，包括生成间隔、包间隔、包交付率和信道繁忙率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在真实交通条件下，协同感知服务在大规模部署中仍具有可行性，并揭示了交通密度、移动模式和通信范围对V2X性能的影响，以及合成交通假设可能高估信道拥堵的情况。

Abstract: Vehicular communication (V2X) technologies are widely regarded as a cornerstone for cooperative and automated driving, yet their large-scale real-world deployment remains limited. As a result, understanding V2X performance under realistic, full-scale traffic conditions continues to be relevant. Most existing performance evaluations rely on synthetic traffic scenarios generated by simulators, which, while useful, may not fully capture the features of real-world traffic. In this paper, we present a large-scale, data-driven evaluation of V2X communication performance using real-world traffic datasets. Vehicle trajectories derived from the Highway Drone (HighD) and Intersection Drone (InD) datasets are converted into simulation-ready formats and coupled with a standardized V2X networking stack to enable message-level performance analysis for entire traffic populations comprising over hundred thousands vehicles across multiple locations. We evaluate key V2X performance indicators, including inter-generation gap, inter-packet gap, packet delivery ratio, and channel busy ratio, across both highway and urban intersection environments. Our results show that cooperative awareness services remain feasible at scale under realistic traffic conditions. In addition, the findings highlight how traffic density, mobility patterns, and communication range influence V2X performance and how synthetic traffic assumptions may overestimate channel congestion.

TL;DR: Mirage框架通过语义表示传输视频，避免原始视觉数据传输，实现高效压缩与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通信框架以信号级保真为导向，导致高通信开销和系统复杂性，尤其在视频通信中带宽消耗显著。

Method: 将视频内容分解为时间序列信息和空间外观表示，通过视频字幕保留时间信息，关键帧编码为紧凑语义表示。

Result: Mirage在视频传输中实现了高达50000倍的数据级压缩加速。

Conclusion: Mirage框架通过分解视频内容为时空互补组件并利用生成模型合成视频，实现了高效、隐私保护的视频传输，支持个性化适配。

Abstract: The existing communication framework mainly aims at accurate reconstruction of source signals to ensure reliable transmission. However, this signal-level fidelity-oriented design often incurs high communication overhead and system complexity, particularly in video communication scenarios where mainstream frameworks rely on transmitting visual data itself, resulting in significant bandwidth consumption. To address this issue, we propose a visual data-free communication framework, Mirage, for extremely efficient video transmission while preserving semantic information. Mirage decomposes video content into two complementary components: temporal sequence information capturing motion dynamics and spatial appearance representations describing overall visual structure. Temporal information is preserved through video captioning, while key frames are encoded into compact semantic representations for spatial appearance. These representations are transmitted to the receiver, where videos are synthesized using generative video models. Since no raw visual data is transmitted, Mirage is inherently privacy-preserving. Mirage also supports personalized adaptation across deployment scenarios. The sender, network, and receiver can independently impose constraints on semantic representation, transmission, and generation, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency, privacy, control, and perceptual quality. Experimental results in video transmission demonstrate that Mirage achieves up to a 50000X data-level compression speedup over raw video transmission, with gains expected to scale with larger video content sizes.

Abstract: The burgeoning and ubiquitous deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape struggles with ultra-low latency demands for computation-intensive tasks in massive connectivity scenarios. In this paper, we propose an innovative uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-base station (BS) mobile edge computing (BS-MEC) network tailored for massive IoT connectivity. To fulfill the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications, we formulate a joint task offloading, user grouping, and power allocation optimization problem with the overarching objective of minimizing the system's total delay, aiming to address issues of unbalanced subchannel access, inter-group interference, computational load disparities, and device heterogeneity. To effectively tackle this problem, we first reformulate task offloading and user grouping into a non-cooperative game model and propose an exact potential game-based joint decision-making (EPG-JDM) algorithm, which dynamically selects optimal task offloading and subchannel access decisions for each IoT device based on its channel conditions, thereby achieving the Nash Equilibrium. Then, we propose a majorization-minimization (MM)-based power allocation algorithm, which transforms the original subproblem into a tractable convex optimization paradigm. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed EPG-JDM algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decision-making algorithms and classic heuristic algorithms, yielding performance improvements of up to 19.3% and 14.7% in terms of total delay and power consumption, respectively.

Result: 在Starlink数据的3个月评估中，相比+Grid，两种方法实现了平均端到端延迟降低45%、跳数减少65%、网络容量提升2.3倍。

Conclusion: 本文提出的两种拓扑设计方法（LSL和SA）在真实部署约束下显著提升了LEO网络的性能，包括降低延迟、减少跳数和提高网络容量，同时能够有效应对节点更换，避免昂贵的拓扑重构。

Abstract: The performance of large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) networks, which consist of thousands of satellites interconnected by optical links, is dependent on its network topology. Existing topology designs often assume idealized conditions and do not account for real-world deployment dynamics, such as partial constellation deployment, daily node turnovers, and varying link availability, making them inapplicable to real LEO networks. In this paper, we develop two topology design methods that explicitly operate under real-world deployment constraints: the Long--Short Links (LSL) method, which systematically combines long-distance shortcut links with short-distance local links, and the Simulated Annealing (SA) method, which constructs topologies via stochastic optimization. Evaluated under both full deployment and partial deployment scenarios using 3-months of Starlink data, our methods achieve up to 45% lower average end-to-end delay, 65% fewer hops, and up to $2.3\times$ higher network capacity compared to +Grid. Both methods are designed to handle daily node turnovers by incrementally updating the topology, maintaining good network performance while avoiding costly full reconstruction of the topology.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to control the reflection of radio-frequency signals and reshape the wireless propagation environment. Unlike traditional studies that primarily focus on the advantages of RISs, this paper examines the negative impacts of RISs by investigating interference propagation caused by user mobility in downlink wireless systems. We employ a stochastic geometric model to simulate the locations of base stations and RISs using the Matérn hard core point process, while user locations are modeled with the homogeneous Poisson point process. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the power distributions of the received signal at the users and the interfering signal. Additionally, we present a novel expression for coverage probability and introduce the concept of interference propagation intensity. To characterize the dynamics of interference caused by user mobility, we adopt an epidemiological approach using the susceptible-infected-susceptible model. Finally, crucial factors influencing the propagation of interference are analyzed. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and provide suggestions for managing interference propagation in large-scale multi-RIS wireless communication networks.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a low-cost, energy-efficient means for enhancing wireless coverage. Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的DHEA-MECD架构在复杂水下环境中实现了高效、稳健的多目标跟踪，显著提升了跟踪成功率、收敛速度和运动最优性。

Abstract: In recent years, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems have demonstrated significant potential in complex marine exploration. However, effective AUV-based tracking remains challenging in realistic underwater environments characterized by high-dimensional features, including coupled kinematic states, spatial constraints, time-varying environmental disturbances, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a hierarchical embodied-intelligence (EI) architecture for underwater multi-target tracking with AUVs in complex underwater environments. Built upon this architecture, we introduce the Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based Multi-Expert Collaborative Decision (DHEA-MECD), a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm designed to support efficient and robust multi-target tracking. Specifically, in DHEA-MECD, a Double-Head Encoder-Attention-based information extraction framework is designed to semantically decompose raw sensory observations and explicitly model complex dependencies among heterogeneous features, including spatial configurations, kinematic states, structural constraints, and stochastic perturbations. On this basis, a motion-stage-aware multi-expert collaborative decision mechanism with Top-k expert selection strategy is introduced to support stage-adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, we propose the DHEA-MECD-based underwater multitarget tracking algorithm to enable AUV smart, stable, and anti-interference multi-target tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior tracking success rates, faster convergence, and improved motion optimality compared with mainstream DRL-based methods, particularly in complex and disturbance-rich marine environments.

Abstract: Future networks must meet stringent requirements while operating within tight energy and carbon constraints. Current autoscaling mechanisms remain workload-centric and infrastructure-siloed, and are largely unaware of their environmental impact. We present NeuroScaler, an AI-native, energy-efficient, and carbon-aware orchestrator for green cloud and edge networks. NeuroScaler aggregates multi-tier telemetry, from Power Distribution Units (PDUs) through bare-metal servers to virtualized infrastructure with containers managed by Kubernetes, using distinct energy and computing metrics at each tier. It supports several machine learning pipelines that link load, performance, and power. Within this unified observability layer, a model-predictive control policy optimizes energy use while meeting service-level objectives. In a real testbed with production-grade servers supporting real services, NeuroScaler reduces energy consumption by 34.68% compared to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) while maintaining target latency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多租户GPU集群中，网络拥塞严重影响ML训练作业的吞吐量，现有方法在流量超过容量时存在根本限制或需要高成本的全二分带宽拓扑。

Method: MonkeyTree利用ML训练流量的特性，将碎片整理问题建模为整数线性规划，最小化工作节点迁移，并通过RDMA实现内存中的检查点恢复机制。

Result: 在2048个GPU的集群中，MonkeyTree将作业平均完成时间提高了14%，在高负载（16:1过度订阅）下保持p99作业完成时间接近理想值。

Conclusion: MonkeyTree通过基于任务迁移的碎片整理有效缓解了多租户GPU集群中的网络拥塞，显著提升了作业完成时间，尤其是在高负载和过度订阅的网络环境中。

Abstract: We present MonkeyTree, the first system to mitigate network congestion in multi-tenant GPU clusters through job-migration based defragmentation rather than network-layer techniques. As cloud operators co-locate ML training jobs on shared, oversubscribed networks, congestion degrades training throughput for over a third of jobs. Prior approaches either rely on routing and flow scheduling--which we show have fundamental limits when traffic exceeds capacity--or require costly full-bisection bandwidth topologies with packet spraying.
  MonkeyTree exploits characteristics of ML training traffic: ring-based collectives generate exactly one cross-rack flow per rack a job spans, making congestion-free placements achievable. The sparse constraint structure admits abundant valid configurations, making them easy to reach with few migrations. Once reached, low fragmentation is self-reinforcing, as new arrivals disturb only a few racks. MonkeyTree formulates defragmentation as an integer linear program that minimizes worker movements, subject to per-rack fragmentation bounds. We prove a tight bound showing any placement can be defragmented to at most two cross-rack fragments per ToR, and extend the formulation to hybrid parallelism with multiple rings per server. Migration is implemented via in-memory checkpoint-and-restore over RDMA, incurring only 9.02 seconds of system overhead end-to-end per worker. We evaluate MonkeyTree using a custom simulator modeling clusters of up to 2,048 H200 GPUs and prototype on a five-node A100 testbed. MonkeyTree improves average job completion time by 14 percent over the next best baseline on a cluster of 1,024 GPUs with a 4:1 oversubscription. With a high 16:1 oversubscription ratio and 2,048 GPUs, MonkeyTree keeps p99 job completion time within 5 percent of ideal.

Motivation: 现有流量分类方法在表示上存在瓶颈，无法有效处理加密和协议演变的挑战，且未显式消除跨层和层内冗余。

Method: PACC 将协议栈视为多视图输入，学习紧凑的层间投影，通过联合目标函数（包括重建、对比互信息学习和监督损失）分解表示。

Result: PACC 在加密应用分类、IoT 设备识别和入侵检测任务中表现优于基线方法，准确率最高提升 12.9%，效率提升 3.16 倍。

Conclusion: PACC 框架通过显式识别和消除网络流量中的冗余，提供了一种既高效又准确的流量分类方法，显著提升了加密流量分类的性能和效率。

Abstract: Network traffic classification is a core primitive for network security and management, yet it is increasingly challenged by pervasive encryption and evolving protocols. A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x.

Method: 采用基于内部后悔最小化的后悔匹配算法，优化传输功率和载波感知阈值（CST）的去中心化配置。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于后悔匹配的去中心化学习算法能够有效提升空间复用（SR）性能，通过内部后悔最小化引导竞争代理达到相关均衡（CE），无需显式通信即可实现协调。模拟结果验证了该方法的优越性，挑战了现有集中式解决方案（如MAPC）的必要性。

Abstract: Spatial Reuse (SR) is a cost-effective technique for improving spectral efficiency in dense IEEE 802.11 deployments by enabling simultaneous transmissions. However, the decentralized optimization of SR parameters -- transmission power and Carrier Sensing Threshold (CST) -- across different Basic Service Sets (BSSs) is challenging due to the lack of global state information. In addition, the concurrent operation of multiple agents creates a highly non-stationary environment, often resulting in suboptimal global configurations (e.g., using the maximum possible transmission power by default). To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a decentralized learning algorithm based on regret-matching, grounded in internal regret minimization. Unlike standard decentralized ``selfish'' approaches that often converge to inefficient Nash Equilibria (NE), internal regret minimization guides competing agents toward Correlated Equilibria (CE), effectively mimicking coordination without explicit communication. Through simulation results, we showcase the superiority of our proposed approach and its ability to reach near-optimal global performance. These results confirm the not-yet-unleashed potential of scalable decentralized solutions and question the need for the heavy signaling overheads and architectural complexity associated with emerging centralized solutions like Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC).

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种去中心化的任务导向语义通信框架，显著降低了多机器人系统在未知3D环境中的通信开销，并提高了协作效率。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems (MRS) rely on exchanging raw sensory data to cooperate in complex three-dimensional (3D) environments. However, this strategy often leads to severe communication congestion and high transmission latency, significantly degrading collaboration efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized task-oriented semantic communication framework for multi-robot collaboration in unknown 3D environments. Each robot locally extracts compact, task-relevant semantics using a lightweight Pixel Difference Network (PiDiNet) with geometric processing. It shares only these semantic updates to build a task-sufficient 3D scene representation that supports cooperative perception, navigation, and object transport. Our numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a dramatic reduction in communication overhead from $858.6$ Mb to $4.0$ Mb (over $200\times$ compression gain) while improving collaboration efficiency by shortening task completion from $1,054$ to $281$ steps.

Conclusion: 6G-Bench是一个开放的基准测试工具，用于评估AI原生6G网络中的语义通信和网络级推理能力，支持开放科学和可重复性。

Abstract: This paper introduces 6G-Bench, an open benchmark for evaluating semantic communication and network-level reasoning in AI-native 6G networks. 6G-Bench defines a taxonomy of 30 decision-making tasks (T1--T30) extracted from ongoing 6G and AI-agent standardization activities in 3GPP, IETF, ETSI, ITU-T, and the O-RAN Alliance, and organizes them into five standardization-aligned capability categories. Starting from 113,475 scenarios, we generate a balanced pool of 10,000 very-hard multiple-choice questions using task-conditioned prompts that enforce multi-step quantitative reasoning under uncertainty and worst-case regret minimization over multi-turn horizons. After automated filtering and expert human validation, 3,722 questions are retained as a high-confidence evaluation set, while the full pool is released to support training and fine-tuning of 6G-specialized models. Using 6G-Bench, we evaluate 22 foundation models spanning dense and mixture-of-experts architectures, short- and long-context designs (up to 1M tokens), and both open-weight and proprietary systems. Across models, deterministic single-shot accuracy (pass@1) spans a wide range from 0.22 to 0.82, highlighting substantial variation in semantic reasoning capability. Leading models achieve intent and policy reasoning accuracy in the range 0.87--0.89, while selective robustness analysis on reasoning-intensive tasks shows pass@5 values ranging from 0.20 to 0.91. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the 6G-Bench dataset on GitHub: https://github.com/maferrag/6G-Bench

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零信任边缘架构，通过统一模块解决IPv6安全与依赖性问题，验证了设计的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IPv6的庞大地址空间导致传统防御措施（如基于IP声誉的防御）无法扩展或适用范围有限，且Neighbor Discovery、Router Advertisements和ICMPv6等协议存在广泛的欺骗和洪泛攻击面。

Method: 采用零信任边缘架构，通过单一可编程数据平面管道实现四个模块（外部欺骗、内部欺骗、外部洪泛、内部洪泛）的统一。设计上优先验证身份可信性，再处理速率可信性。

Result: 通过BMv2原型和Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC验证了设计的可行性，覆盖了15种场景的测试，包括单向量、双向量和多向量组合攻击。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种零信任边缘架构，通过单一可编程数据平面管道统一了四个模块，有效解决了IPv6依赖性与安全性问题。通过BMv2原型和Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC的验证，证明了其可行性和有效性。

Abstract: IPv6 dependability is increasingly inseparable from IPv6 security: Neighbor Discovery (ND), Router Advertisements (RA), and ICMPv6 are essential for correct operation yet expose a broad attack surface for spoofing and flooding. Meanwhile, IPv6's massive address space breaks per-IP reputation and makes many defenses either non-scalable or narrowly scoped (e.g., only internal threats, only RA abuse, or only volumetric floods). We propose a zero-trust edge architecture implemented in a single programmable data-plane pipeline that unifies four modules: external spoofing, internal spoofing, external flooding, and internal flooding. A key design choice is to enforce identity plausibility before rate plausibility: stateless per-packet validation filters spoofed traffic early so that time-window statistics for flooding operate on credible identities. We outline a concrete P4 design (prefix Hop-Limit bands, DAD-anchored address-port bindings, and Count-Min Sketch windowed counting) and evaluate it across a systematic 15-scenario suite spanning single-, dual-, and multi-vector compositions. We report results from a BMv2 prototype and validate the same pipeline on a Netronome NFP-4000 SmartNIC, and we discuss limitations and open directions.

Motivation: 多RAT物联网设备（如无人机）的普及带来了信任边界频繁跨越的新挑战，而现有ZTA框架未对此动态环境进行适配，亟需研究解决。

Method: 通过分析多RAT环境下物联网设备（如无人机）在不同网络信任域间切换时的信任状态变化，揭示了现有ZTA框架的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，当前ZTA框架假设网络环境相对稳定，无法有效处理移动IoT设备在多RAT间动态切换时的信任问题。

Conclusion: 论文指出，当前零信任架构（ZTA）框架未能充分考虑移动物联网设备在多无线电接入技术（RAT）频繁切换时的信任边界问题，呼吁未来研究需针对这一动态环境进行优化。

Abstract: The proliferation of Multi-Radio Access Technology, Internet of Things devices, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operating across LoRaWAN, 5G/4G cellular, Meshtastic mesh, proprietary protocols such as DJI OcuSync, MAVLink telemetry links, Wi-Fi, and satellite, creates a fundamental and hitherto unexamined challenge for Zero Trust Architecture adoption. Each transition between radio access technologies constitutes a trust boundary crossing: the device exits one network trust domain and enters another, potentially invalidating authentication state, device attestation, and contextual trust signals. Current ZTA frameworks assume relatively stable network environments and do not address the trust implications of frequent, dynamic RAT switching in mobile IoT deployments.

Method: 提出了Parallel Track (PT) Transformer架构，重新组织计算以减少跨设备依赖，并集成到Tensor-RT-LLM和vLLM中。

Result: PT Transformer相比标准张量并行减少了16倍的同步操作，在实验中保持了模型质量，服务效率提升显著，包括首次令牌时间减少15-30%，每个输出令牌时间减少2-12%，吞吐量提升高达31.90%。

Conclusion: PT Transformer通过重构计算最小化跨设备依赖，显著减少了同步操作，提升了LLM的服务效率，同时保持了模型质量。

Abstract: Efficient large-scale inference of transformer-based large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental systems challenge, frequently requiring multi-GPU parallelism to meet stringent latency and throughput targets. Conventional tensor parallelism decomposes matrix operations across devices but introduces substantial inter-GPU synchronization, leading to communication bottlenecks and degraded scalability. We propose the Parallel Track (PT) Transformer, a novel architectural paradigm that restructures computation to minimize cross-device dependencies. PT achieves up to a 16x reduction in synchronization operations relative to standard tensor parallelism, while maintaining competitive model quality in our experiments. We integrate PT into two widely adopted LLM serving stacks-Tensor-RT-LLM and vLLM-and report consistent improvements in serving efficiency, including up to 15-30% reduced time to first token, 2-12% reduced time per output token, and up to 31.90% increased throughput in both settings.

Abstract: Modern distributed decision-making systems face significant challenges arising from data heterogeneity, dynamic environments, and the need for decentralized coordination. This paper introduces the Knowledge Sharing paradigm as an innovative approach that uses the semantic richness of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and the representational power of Graph Embeddings (GEs) to achieve decentralized intelligence. Our architecture empowers individual nodes to locally construct semantic representations of their operational context, iteratively aggregating embeddings through neighbor-based exchanges using GraphSAGE. This iterative local aggregation process results in a dynamically evolving global semantic abstraction called Knowledge Map, enabling coordinated decision-making without centralized control. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments under a distributed resource orchestration use case. We simulate different network topologies and node workloads, analyzing the local semantic drift of individual nodes. Experimental results confirm that our distributed knowledge-sharing mechanism effectively maintains semantic coherence and adaptability, making it suitable for complex and dynamic environments such as Edge Computing, IoT, and multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 本研究成功将隐私约束引入多访问分布式计算（MADC）模型，并针对两种特定连接模型开发了私有编码方案。通过构建新型扩展放置交付数组家族及对应编码方案，确保了每个减速器分配功能的隐私性。

Abstract: Distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce have become essential for large-scale data processing by decomposing tasks across multiple nodes. The multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model further advances this paradigm by decoupling mapper and reducer roles: dedicated mapper nodes store data and compute intermediate values, while reducer nodes are connected to multiple mappers and aggregate results to compute final outputs. This separation reduces communication bottlenecks without requiring file replication. In this paper, we introduce privacy constraints into MADC and develop private coded schemes for two specific connectivity models. We construct new families of extended placement delivery arrays and derive corresponding coding schemes that guarantee privacy of each reducer's assigned function.

Conclusion: HEAL是一种高效的低开销恢复方案，适用于现代无领导者分布式系统，显著提升了恢复速度和系统吞吐量。

Abstract: Ensuring resilience in distributed systems has become an acute concern. In today's environment, it is crucial to develop light-weight mechanisms that recover a distributed system from faults quickly and with only a small impact on the live-system throughput. To address this need, this paper proposes a new low-overhead, general recovery scheme for modern non-transactional leaderless distributed systems. We call our scheme HEAL. On a node failure, HEAL performs an optimized online incremental recovery. This paper presents HEAL's algorithms for settings with Linearizable consistency and different memory persistency models. We implement HEAL on a 6-node Intel cluster. Our experiments running TAOBench workloads show that HEAL is very effective. HEAL recovers the cluster in 120 milliseconds on average, while reducing the throughput of the running workload by an average of 8.7%. In contrast, a conventional recovery scheme for leaderless systems needs 360 seconds to recover, reducing the throughput of the system by 16.2%. Finally, compared to an incremental recovery scheme for a state-of-the-art leader-based system, HEAL reduces the average recovery latency by 20.7x and the throughput degradation by 62.4%.

Result: ReCXL实现了容错执行，性能仅比无容错支持的平台慢30%。

Conclusion: ReCXL成功扩展了CXL规范，使其能够抵御节点故障并正确恢复应用状态，仅带来30%的性能开销。

Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) 3.0 and beyond allows the compute nodes of a cluster to share data with hardware cache coherence and at the granularity of a cache line. This enables shared-memory semantics for distributed computing, but introduces new resilience challenges: a node failure leads to the loss of the dirty data in its caches, corrupting application state. Unfortunately, the CXL specification does not consider processor failures. Moreover, when a component fails, the specification tries to isolate it and continue application execution; there is no attempt to bring the application to a consistent state. To address these limitations, this paper extends the CXL specification to be resilient to node failures, and to correctly recover the application after node failures. We call the system ReCXL. To handle the failure of nodes, ReCXL augments the coherence transaction of a write with messages that propagate the update to a small set of other nodes (i.e., Replicas). Replicas save the update in a hardware Logging Unit. Such replication ensures resilience to node failures. Then, at regular intervals, the Logging Units dump the updates to memory. Recovery involves using the logs in the Logging Units to bring the directory and memory to a correct state. Our evaluation shows that ReCXL enables fault-tolerant execution with only a 30% slowdown over the same platform with no fault-tolerance support.

Motivation: 现有反应式丢弃策略无法及时做出丢弃决策或选择正确的请求集，导致吞吐量低下。

Method: 设计了PARD推理系统，结合主动丢弃方法和自适应请求优先级机制，利用运行时信息决定何时丢弃请求及选择具体丢弃的请求。

Result: 在64个GPU集群上的实验表明，PARD比现有技术提高了16%-176%的吞吐量，丢弃率和资源浪费分别降低了1.6-17倍和1.5-62倍。

Conclusion: PARD系统通过主动丢弃请求和自适应优先级机制，显著提高了推理管道的吞吐量，同时降低了丢弃率和资源浪费。

Abstract: Modern deep neural network (DNN) applications integrate multiple DNN models into inference pipelines with stringent latency requirements for customized tasks. To mitigate extensive request timeouts caused by accumulation, systems for inference pipelines commonly drop a subset of requests so the remaining ones can satisfy latency constraints. Since it is commonly believed that request dropping adversely affects goodput, existing systems only drop requests when they have to, which we call reactive dropping. However, this reactive policy can not maintain high goodput, as it neither makes timely dropping decisions nor identifies the proper set of requests to drop, leading to issues of dropping requests too late or dropping the wrong set of requests.
  We propose that the inference system should proactively drop certain requests in advance to enhance the goodput across the entire workload. To achieve this, we design an inference system PARD. It enhances goodput with timely and precise dropping decisions by integrating a proactive dropping method that decides when to drop requests using runtime information of the inference pipeline, and an adaptive request priority mechanism that selects which specific requests to drop based on remaining latency budgets and workload intensity. Evaluation on a cluster of 64 GPUs over real-world workloads shows that PARD achieves $16\%$-$176\%$ higher goodput than the state of the art while reducing the drop rate and wasted computation resources by $1.6\times$-$17\times$ and $1.5\times$-$62\times$ respectively.

Abstract: Driven by breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence is rapidly advancing into industrial manufacturing. In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing.

Abstract: Multi-robot collaboration tasks often require heterogeneous robots to work together over long horizons under spatial constraints and environmental uncertainties. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

TL;DR: KANLoc是一种结合VO和KAN网络的单目定位框架，显著减少漂移并提高定位精度，适用于月球着陆任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉里程计（VO）存在无界漂移问题，而基于地图的绝对定位在纹理稀疏或低光地形中失效，因此需要一种新的定位框架来解决这些问题。

Method: KANLoc框架核心是一个Kolmogorov-Arnold Network（KAN），学习从图像特征到地图坐标的复杂映射，生成稀疏但高度可靠的全局姿态锚点，并通过捆绑调整框架融合这些锚点。

Result: 在合成和真实月球着陆数据集上，KANLoc将平均平移和旋转误差分别降低了32%和45%，单轨迹增益高达45%/48%，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: KANLoc通过结合VO和轻量级绝对姿态回归器，显著提高了月球着陆的6-DoF定位精度，减少了漂移并保持了局部运动精度。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time 6-DoF localization is mission-critical for autonomous lunar landing, yet existing approaches remain limited: visual odometry (VO) drifts unboundedly, while map-based absolute localization fails in texture-sparse or low-light terrain. We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines.

Abstract: The integration of drones into the medical field has revolutionized healthcare delivery by enabling rapid transportation of medical supplies, organs, and even emergency assistance in remote or disaster-stricken areas. While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations. With these considerations, this survey aims to provide insights into optimizing GNC frameworks for medical drones, emphasizing research gaps and directions to improve real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: As hardware and software systems have grown in complexity, formal methods have been indispensable tools for rigorously specifying acceptable behaviors, synthesizing programs to meet these specifications, and validating the correctness of existing programs. In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉相似性的分层导航框架，通过简单的可转移子目标选择网络和潜在空间记忆模块，实现了在无地图、无GPS环境中的高效导航。该方法无需里程计，且在交互导航中表现出色。

Abstract: Visual navigation for robotics is inspired by the human ability to navigate environments using visual cues and memory, eliminating the need for detailed maps. In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance.

Motivation: 在自主化学实验室环境中，机械臂需要精确操作易碎的玻璃容器和危险化学品，因此需要一种能够处理不确定性和干扰的鲁棒控制策略。

Method: 本研究采用基于模型的滑模控制（MBSMC），结合双曲正切函数来调节安装在移动平台上的机械臂运动，旨在最小化突变并实现平稳、精确的轨迹跟踪。

Result: 与PID和NMBSMC相比，MBSMC实现了显著更平滑的运动和高达90%的控制努力降低，成功完成了容器抓取和窗口操作等任务，而PID控制由于无法处理非线性动态和外部干扰而失败。

Conclusion: 研究验证了基于模型的滑模控制（MBSMC）在自主化学实验室环境中对机械臂运动的精确控制能力，显著优于非模型滑模控制（NMBSMC）和PID控制器，为智能移动机械臂的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Precise handling of chemical instruments and materials within a self-driving laboratory environment using robotic systems demands advanced and reliable control strategies. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成大规模家庭数据集，验证了双向耦合的有效性，为家庭智能设备的开发和测试提供了支持。

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have catalyzed research in Embodied AI to develop interactive agents capable of environmental reasoning and interaction. Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.
  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.
  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences. These contributions enable development and testing of household smart devices at scale.

Conclusion: 本文提出的RGB-D SLAM系统成功实现了语言对齐的密集特征场重建，同时保持了低延迟的跟踪与映射，填补了3D感知与语言推理之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a RGB-D SLAM system that reconstructs a language-aligned dense feature field while sustaining low-latency tracking and mapping. First, we introduce a Top-K Rendering pipeline, a high-throughput and semantic-distortion-free method for efficiently rendering high-dimensional feature maps. To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS. Our results demonstrate that online SLAM with dense, uncompressed language-aligned feature fields is both feasible and effective, bridging the gap between 3D perception and language-based reasoning.

Abstract: The availability of commercial wireless communication and sensing equipment combined with the advancements in intelligent autonomous systems paves the way towards robust joint communications and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.

Abstract: Self driving laboratories (SDLs) are highly automated research environments that leverage advanced technologies to conduct experiments and analyze data with minimal human involvement. These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration.

TL;DR: ARGOS框架通过属性引导的组合推理，将开放指令与具体物理属性结合，生成物理合理的危险场景并实例化为功能安全需求，解决了传统HARA和LLMs在具身AI安全中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HARA方法在具身AI领域难以扩展，因其依赖有限预定义功能列表的风险枚举，而具身AI基于开放的自然语言指令操作，导致组合交互风险的挑战。LLMs虽有望解决可扩展性问题，但缺乏物理基础，导致危险描述语义浅薄且不连贯。

Method: ARGOS（AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning）框架通过动态分解指令中的实体为细粒度属性，将LLM推理基于因果风险因素，生成物理上合理的危险场景，并结合机器人能力实例化抽象安全标准（如ISO 13482）为具体功能安全需求（FSRs）。

Conclusion: ARGOS框架为具身AI的安全工业部署提供了系统化且基于物理的功能安全需求生成方法，是确保其在开放世界中安全部署的关键一步。

Abstract: Ensuring functional safety is essential for the deployment of Embodied AI in complex open-world environments. However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI.

Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.

Conclusion: TC-AACG模型通过非瞬时弹性踝关节推进，显著扩展了双足模型的运动能力，优于传统的瞬时推进方法。

Abstract: Passive dynamic walkers are widely adopted as a mathematical model to represent biped walking. The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model.

Abstract: Localization and mapping of an environment are crucial tasks for any robot operating in unstructured environments. Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2° in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly transforming multiple applications, from agricultural and infrastructure monitoring to logistics and defense. Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term "simulation-to-reality gap". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot. We show that it supports over 20x faster-than-real-time, end-to-end simulation of a complete development and deployment stack -- including edge compute and networking -- significantly compressing the build-test-release cycle of perception-based autonomy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently achieved remarkable success in robotics by formulating action prediction as a conditional denoising process. However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了在极简传感条件下（仅依赖单轴指尖力反馈和关节本体感受）实现可靠多指抓取的可行性，显著降低了现实抓取系统的传感需求。

Abstract: Grasping under limited sensing remains a fundamental challenge for real-world robotic manipulation, as vision and high-resolution tactile sensors often introduce cost, fragility, and integration complexity. This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\%$ overall grasp success rate. These results demonstrate strong robustness and generalization beyond the simulation training distribution, while significantly reducing sensing requirements for real-world grasping systems.

Method: UEREBot采用分层框架，结合时空规划器提供目标导向和威胁信号，通过威胁感知切换融合导航与反射动作，并利用控制屏障函数作为执行保障。

Result: 在仿真和实际部署中，UEREBot在复杂静态结构和高速动态障碍环境中表现出更高的避障成功率和稳定移动性，同时保持目标进度。

Conclusion: UEREBot通过分层框架有效解决了四足机器人在非结构化环境中安全移动的冲突，实现了目标进度与避障安全的平衡。

Abstract: Quadruped robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured environments. Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs.

TL;DR: TF-DP通过历史轨迹条件化解决长时程任务中的多模态动作模糊问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长时程任务中，视觉相似的观察常导致多模态动作模糊（MA2），仅基于瞬时观察的策略会产生模糊预测。

Method: 提出了Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP)，一种基于扩散的框架，将历史运动表示为显式执行轨迹并投影到视觉观察空间，提供阶段感知上下文。

Result: TF-DP在具有明显多模态动作模糊和视觉干扰的任务中表现优异，比基础扩散策略分别提高了80.56%和86.11%，推理效率仅增加6.4%。

Conclusion: TF-DP通过显式地基于执行历史条件化动作生成，显著提高了在长时程任务中的时间一致性和鲁棒性，证明了执行轨迹条件化是一种可扩展且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Generative model-based policies have shown strong performance in imitation-based robotic manipulation by learning action distributions from demonstrations. However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.

Conclusion: Koopman-UBM（K-UBM）在模拟和真实任务中表现优异，不仅匹配或超越了现有基线，还提供了更快的推理速度、平滑的执行、对遮挡的鲁棒性以及灵活的重新规划能力。

Abstract: There has been rapid and dramatic progress in robots' ability to learn complex visuo-motor manipulation skills from demonstrations, thanks in part to expressive policy classes that employ diffusion- and transformer-based backbones. However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.

Abstract: Effective human-robot interaction requires emotionally rich multimodal expressions, yet most humanoid robots lack coordinated speech, facial expressions, and gestures. Meanwhile, real-world deployment demands on-device solutions that can operate autonomously without continuous cloud connectivity. To bridging \underline{\textit{S}}peech, \underline{\textit{E}}motion, and \underline{\textit{M}}otion, we present \textit{SeM$^2$}, a Vision Language Model-based framework that orchestrates emotionally coherent multimodal interactions through three key components: a multimodal perception module capturing user contextual cues, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning for response planning, and a novel Semantic-Sequence Aligning Mechanism (SSAM) that ensures precise temporal coordination between verbal content and physical expressions. We implement both cloud-based and \underline{\textit{e}}dge-deployed versions (\textit{SeM$^2_e$}), with the latter knowledge distilled to operate efficiently on edge hardware while maintaining 95\% of the relative performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.

Conclusion: TextOp通过结合交互式运动生成与稳健的全身控制，实现了自由形式的意图表达，并在单个连续运动执行中实现了多个挑战性行为（如跳舞和跳跃）之间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Recent advances in humanoid whole-body motion tracking have enabled the execution of diverse and highly coordinated motions on real hardware. However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

Abstract: Humanoid facial expression shadowing enables robots to realistically imitate human facial expressions in real time, which is critical for lifelike, facially expressive humanoid robots and affective human-robot interaction. Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices. VividFace produces vivid humanoid faces by mimicking human facial expressions within 0.05 seconds, while generalizing across diverse facial configurations. Extensive real-world demonstrations validate its practical utility. Videos are available at: https://lipzh5.github.io/VividFace/.

Conclusion: iSTAR框架通过参数空间的结构化推理实现了功能分化，显著提升了VLA模型的任务分解可靠性和成功率，证明了其在任务变体中的泛化能力。

Abstract: As robots are expected to perform increasingly diverse tasks, they must understand not only low-level actions but also the higher-level structure that determines how a task should unfold. Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.

Abstract: The presentation of a robot's capability and identity directly influences a human collaborator's perception and implicit trust in the robot. Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant. Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities. This work signals how future robots can leverage different embodiment configurations to obtain the benefit of multiple robots within a single body.

Motivation: 为了解决视觉-语言导航中端到端策略优化的复杂性，LCLA旨在通过模块化感知-动作接口，将视觉运动学习简化为监督潜在对齐问题。

Method: LCLA首先利用特权状态信息训练专家策略，生成一个足以控制的潜在空间，然后冻结其潜在接口和动作头。接着训练一个轻量级适配器，将原始视觉-语言观察通过冻结的视觉-语言模型映射到专家的潜在空间。

Conclusion: LCLA框架通过将感知与控制解耦，实现了跨感知模态和环境变化的专家行为复用，同时在推理时保持轻量级。

Abstract: We propose LCLA (Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment), a framework for vision-language navigation that learns modular perception-action interfaces by aligning sensory observations to a latent representation of an expert policy. The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.

Abstract: This paper develops the proof of concept for a novel affine transformable unmanned ground vehicle (ATUGV) with the capability of safe and aggressive deformation while carrying multiple payloads. The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.

Conclusion: 结合本文方法与迭代优化方法在检测对称平面数量及计算时间方面取得了令人满意的结果。

Abstract: Detecting symmetry is crucial for effective object grasping for several reasons. Recognizing symmetrical features or axes within an object helps in developing efficient grasp strategies, as grasping along these axes typically results in a more stable and balanced grip, thereby facilitating successful manipulation. This paper employs geometrical moments to identify symmetries and estimate orthogonal transformations, including rotations and mirror transformations, for objects centered at the frame origin. It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \( n \)-tuples. Extensive validation tests are conducted on both 2D and 3D objects to ensure the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. The proposed method is also compared to state-of-the-art work using iterative optimization for detecting multiple planes of symmetry. The results indicate that combining our method with the iterative one yields satisfactory outcomes in terms of the number of symmetry planes detected and computation time.

Abstract: In this study, we address vision-language-guided multi-robot cooperative transport, where each robot grounds natural-language instructions from onboard camera observations. A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots. The demonstration video is available at https://sites.google.com/view/colf/.

Conclusion: USER提供了一个统一且可扩展的系统基础，支持真实世界中的在线策略学习，实现了多机器人协调、异构机械臂操作、边缘-云端协作以及长期异步训练。

Abstract: Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有VLA模型在固定计算深度下无法适应不同复杂度任务的问题，以及CoT提示在连续动作空间中的局限性。

Method: 采用循环权重绑定的动作头，通过时间截断反向传播（TBPTT）训练，支持任意推理深度。

Result: 实验显示，复杂任务在四次迭代后成功率从0%提升至90%，简单任务快速饱和，且内存占用恒定。

Conclusion: RD-VLA架构通过潜在迭代优化实现了计算适应性，显著提升了复杂任务的性能，同时保持了恒定的内存占用和高达80倍的推理加速。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on fixed computational depth, expending the same amount of compute on simple adjustments and complex multi-step manipulation. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Abstract: Image guided robotic navigation systems often rely on reference based geometric perception pipelines, where accurate spatial mapping is established through multi stage estimation processes. In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the instability of analytic PnP solutions in near-field scenarios due to strong perspective effects and heterogeneous measurement noise.

Result: The proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art methods, with high computational efficiency, as validated by experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that explicit geometric error modeling is crucial for reliable camera pose estimation in challenging near-field settings, as demonstrated by the proposed method's accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Camera pose estimation from sparse correspondences is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision and remains particularly challenging in near-field scenarios, where strong perspective effects and heterogeneous measurement noise can significantly degrade the stability of analytic PnP solutions. In this paper, we present a geometric error propagation framework for camera pose estimation based on a parallel perspective approximation. By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight the importance of explicit geometric error modeling for reliable camera pose estimation in challenging near-field settings.

Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicles and robots utilize versatile sensors for localization and mapping. The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: 本文通过实验验证了在硬惩罚机制下，多智能体路径规划问题能够获得帕累托最优解，且D-Wave混合求解器与Gurobi在目标值和运行时表现相近。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Route Planning considers selecting vehicles, each associated with a single predefined route, such that the spatial coverage of a road network is increased while redundant overlaps are limited. This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.

Abstract: Securing petroleum infrastructure requires balancing autonomous system efficiency with human judgment for threat escalation, a challenge unaddressed by classical facility location models assuming homogeneous resources. This paper formulates the Human-Robot Co-Dispatch Facility Location Problem (HRCD-FLP), a capacitated facility location variant incorporating tiered infrastructure criticality, human-robot supervision ratio constraints, and minimum utilization requirements. We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage. For small problems, exact methods dominate in both cost and computation time; for larger problems, the proposed heuristic achieves feasible solutions in under 3 minutes with approximately 14% optimality gap where comparison is possible. From systems perspective, our work demonstrate that optimized planning for human-robot teaming is key to achieve both cost-effective and mission-reliable deployments.

Abstract: Planning over unstructured terrain presents a significant challenge in the field of legged robotics. Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.

Abstract: Simulation is crucial in the development of autonomous driving software. In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2.

Abstract: The ability to dynamically manipulate interaction between cables, carried by pairs of aerial vehicles attached to the ends of each cable, can greatly improve the versatility and agility of cable-assisted aerial manipulation. Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input. Numerical simulations validate our approach, demonstrating stable, high-speed tracking of dynamic references.

Abstract: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet current methods rely on rigid templates to specify reasoning primitives (e.g., objects in the scene, high-level plans, structural affordances). These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives. R&B-EnCoRe enables models to distill reasoning that is predictive of successful control, bypassing manual annotation engineering while grounding internet-scale knowledge in physical execution.

Abstract: Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.

Conclusion: STEP 通过其轻量级的时空一致性预测机制和速度感知扰动注入机制，显著提高了推理延迟和成功率，超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for visuomotor control in robotic manipulation due to their ability to model the distribution of action sequences and capture multimodality. However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods.

Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种实例感知的NBV策略，通过对象特征优化视点选择，显著提升了3D重建的精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遮挡和观察不完整的杂乱场景中，选择信息丰富的视点对于构建可靠表示至关重要。现有方法仅依赖几何线索，忽略了与操作相关的语义，并倾向于优先利用而非探索。

Method: 该方法引入了对象感知的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），将实例级信息蒸馏为一热对象向量，用于计算置信加权信息增益，从而指导识别与错误和不确定高斯相关的区域。

Result: 实验表明，与基线相比，NBV策略在合成数据集上减少了77.14%的深度误差，在真实世界GraspNet数据集上减少了34.10%。针对特定对象的NBV进一步减少了25.60%的深度误差。

Conclusion: 论文提出的实例感知NBV策略通过利用对象特征优先考虑未探索区域，显著减少了深度误差，并在真实世界机器人操作任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In cluttered scenes with inevitable occlusions and incomplete observations, selecting informative viewpoints is essential for building a reliable representation. In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决灵巧操作中因实体差异导致的策略训练困难，避免为不同实体单独训练策略或依赖共享动作空间。

Method: 基于改进的Transformer架构，利用历史观察条件推断形态和动态，实时适应不同手部配置并生成合适的控制动作。

Result: DexFormer在Leap Hand、Allegro Hand和Rapid Hand上表现出强大的零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: DexFormer通过动态感知的跨实体策略，成功实现了在异构手部实体间的泛化，为跨实体灵巧操作提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics, requiring coherent control of high-DoF hands and arms under complex, contact-rich dynamics. A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化、入侵物种和人类活动正在以前所未有的速度破坏全球珊瑚礁，威胁其生物多样性和渔业资源，减少海岸保护。解决这一巨大挑战需要可扩展的珊瑚再生技术，能够培育气候适应型物种并加速自然再生过程，但这些行动因缺乏安全可靠的工具来处理脆弱珊瑚而受阻。

Method: ReefFlex是一种生成式软手指设计方法，通过探索多样化的软手指空间，生成能够安全抓取脆弱且几何异质性珊瑚的候选设计。关键是将异质性抓取编码为一组简化的运动原语，形成一个可处理的多目标优化问题。

Conclusion: ReefFlex提供了一种通用的方法来设计软末端执行器，用于复杂操作，并为珊瑚处理等以前难以实现的领域自动化铺平了道路。

Abstract: Climate change, invasive species and human activities are currently damaging the world's coral reefs at unprecedented rates, threatening their vast biodiversity and fisheries, and reducing coastal protection. Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize global transportation systems. However, its widespread acceptance and market penetration remain significantly below expectations. This gap is primarily driven by persistent challenges in safety, comfort, commuting efficiency and energy economy when compared to the performance of experienced human drivers. We hypothesize that these challenges can be addressed through the development of a driver foundation model (DFM). Accordingly, we propose a framework for establishing DFMs to comprehensively benchmark AVs. Specifically, we describe a large-scale dataset collection strategy for training a DFM, discuss the core functionalities such a model should possess, and explore potential technical solutions to realize these functionalities. We further present the utility of the DFM across the operational spectrum, from defining human-centric safety envelopes to establishing benchmarks for energy economy. Overall, We aim to formalize the DFM concept and introduce a new paradigm for the systematic specification, verification and validation of AVs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶时不考虑与周围车辆的偏好距离可能导致用户不适，因此需要一种能明确纳入用户偏好安全距离的规划框架。

Method: 设计了一个定制问卷来捕捉用户偏好，并将其作为最优控制问题的约束条件；通过分解原始问题为多个子问题并并行求解，以降低计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 提出的规划框架通过分解问题并并行处理子问题，有效解决了实时计算复杂性的问题，并通过模拟验证了其能更好地反映用户偏好。

Abstract: Driving without considering the preferred separation distance from surrounding vehicles may cause discomfort for users. To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment.

Abstract: Aerial insects can effortlessly navigate dense vegetation, whereas similarly sized aerial robots typically depend on offboard sensors and computation to maintain stable flight. This disparity restricts insect-scale robots to operation within motion capture environments, substantially limiting their applicability to tasks such as search-and-rescue and precision agriculture. In this work, we present a 1.29-gram aerial robot capable of hovering and tracking trajectories with solely onboard sensing and computation. The combination of a sensor suite, estimators, and a low-level controller achieved centimeter-scale positional flight accuracy. Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.

Abstract: Planning under uncertainty for real-world robotics tasks, such as autonomous driving, requires reasoning in enormous high-dimensional belief spaces, rendering the problem computationally intensive. While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\times$--$1073\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking. Evaluated on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks, Vec-QMDP achieves state-of-the-art planning performance with millisecond-level latency, establishing CPUs as a high-performance computing platform for large-scale planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Realizing versatile and human-like performance in high-demand sports like badminton remains a formidable challenge for humanoid robotics. Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a "mimic" to a capable "striker." Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of anthropomorphic badminton skills to a humanoid robot, successfully replicating the kinetic elegance and functional precision of human athletes in the physical world.

Method: 研究团队提出了BiManiBench，一个分层次的基准测试框架，评估MLLMs在基础空间推理、高级动作规划和低级末端执行器控制三个层级的表现。

Result: 分析了30多个前沿模型后发现，尽管MLLMs在高级推理上表现良好，但在双臂空间定位和控制上表现不佳，常导致相互干扰和序列错误。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在双臂任务的时空协调上存在显著不足，尤其是在空间定位和控制方面。未来的研究需要关注双臂间的碰撞避免和细粒度时间序列规划。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.

Conclusion: Graph-Loc 在公开基准测试、压力测试和实际部署中表现出色，能够在几何退化和持续遮挡的情况下实现准确稳定的姿态跟踪。

Abstract: Map-based LiDAR pose tracking is essential for long-term autonomous operation, where onboard map priors need be compact for scalable storage and fast retrieval, while online observations are often partial, repetitive, and heavily occluded. We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的LLM oracle聚合方法及基于Hyperledger Fabric的去中心化多机器人基础设施，实验证明其可行性和优越性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for transforming natural language user intents into executable actions. This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, and the proposed aggregation method outperforms other aggregation methods currently in use.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is imperative yet challenging for robots to execute complex tasks, requiring coordinated collaboration between two arms. However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

Conclusion: SteerVLA通过结合高层视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理能力和低层视觉语言动作（VLA）驾驶策略，显著提升了自动驾驶在长尾事件中的表现。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in autonomous driving is the integration of high-level, semantic reasoning for long-tail events with low-level, reactive control for robust driving. While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.

Abstract: Vision-guided robotic systems are increasingly deployed in precision alignment tasks that require reliable execution under near-field and off-axis configurations. While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.

Abstract: Various musculoskeletal humanoids have been developed so far, and numerous studies on control mechanisms have been conducted to leverage the advantages of their biomimetic bodies. However, there has not been sufficient and unified discussion on the diverse properties inherent in these musculoskeletal structures, nor on how to manage and utilize them. Therefore, this study categorizes and analyzes the characteristics of muscles, as well as their management and utilization methods, based on the various research conducted on the musculoskeletal humanoids we have developed, Kengoro and Musashi. We classify the features of the musculoskeletal structure into five properties: Redundancy, Independency, Anisotropy, Variable Moment Arm, and Nonlinear Elasticity. We then organize the diverse advantages and disadvantages of musculoskeletal humanoids that arise from the combination of these properties. In particular, we discuss body schema learning and reflex control, along with muscle grouping and body schema adaptation. Also, we describe the implementation of movements through an integrated system and discuss future challenges and prospects.

Conclusion: UniPlan通过将视觉-语言模型推理与符号规划结合，显著提升了大规模室内环境中长时程移动操作任务的规划效果，在成功率、规划质量和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Integration of VLM reasoning with symbolic planning has proven to be a promising approach to real-world robot task planning. Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 强化学习在接触丰富的操作环境中可能难以充分探索和发现复杂操作策略，尤其是在稀疏奖励设置下。因此，需要一种方法通过可行状态的低维流形来引导RL。

Conclusion: Sample-Guided RL 成功地在接触丰富的操作环境中训练出通用策略，能够从任何可行起始状态到达任何可行目标状态。该方法在简单和复杂场景中均表现出色，尤其是在稀疏奖励设置下。

Abstract: We consider how model-based solvers can be leveraged to guide training of a universal policy to control from any feasible start state to any feasible goal in a contact-rich manipulation setting. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.

Abstract: Generalist humanoid motion trackers have recently achieved strong simulation metrics by scaling data and training, yet often remain brittle on hardware during sustained teleoperation due to interface- and dynamics-induced errors. We present MOSAIC, an open-source, full-stack system for humanoid motion tracking and whole-body teleoperation across multiple interfaces. MOSAIC first learns a teleoperation-oriented general motion tracker via RL on a multi-source motion bank with adaptive resampling and rewards that emphasize world-frame motion consistency, which is critical for mobile teleoperation. To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning. We validate MOSAIC with systematic ablations, out-of-distribution benchmarking, and real-robot experiments demonstrating robust offline motion replay and online long-horizon teleoperation under realistic latency and noise.

Abstract: Aerial manipulation requires force-aware capabilities to enable safe and effective grasping and physical interaction. Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) has achieved impressive success in dexterous manipulation through generative modeling and pretraining, state-of-the-art approaches like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models still struggle with adaptation to environmental changes and skill transfer. We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer.

Abstract: Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in complex missions that demand reliable autonomous navigation and robust obstacle avoidance. However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization, enabling reliable high-speed navigation in dense clutter and challenging outdoor forest environments at velocities up to 7.5m/s.

Abstract: Teleoperation inherently relies on the human operator acting as a closed-loop controller to actively compensate for hardware imperfections, including latency, mechanical friction, and lack of explicit force feedback. Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to "Intent Cloning" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a "virtual equilibrium point", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

Abstract: Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing Gaussian Splatting as an efficient universal view transformer that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation. Our main contribution is GaussianCaR, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance on par with, or even surpassing, the state of the art on BEV segmentation tasks (57.3%, 82.9%, and 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a 3.2x faster inference runtime.

Abstract: Function offloading is a promising solution to address limitations concerning computational capacity and available energy of Connected Automated Vehicles~(CAVs) or other autonomous robots by distributing computational tasks between local and remote computing devices in form of distributed services. This paper presents a generic function offloading framework that can be used to offload an arbitrary set of computational tasks with a focus on autonomous driving. To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs. Moreover, the simulation results also show the adaptability of the framework to diverse scenarios involving simultaneous offloading requests from multiple CAVs.

Abstract: The integration of service-oriented architectures (SOA) with function offloading for distributed, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) offers the opportunity for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to extend their locally available services. One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的有限时间控制器家族在无时间延迟情况下，能够确保位置误差和速度全局收敛至零，并通过仿真和实验结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of finite-time controllers for the bilateral teleoperation of fully actuated nonlinear Euler-Lagrange systems. Based on the energy-shaping framework and under the standard assumption of passive interactions with the human and the environment, the controllers ensure that the position error and velocities globally converge to zero in the absence of time delays. In this case, the closed-loop system admits a homogeneous approximation of negative degree, and thus the control objective is achieved in finite-time. The proposed controllers are simple, continuous-time proportional-plus-damping-injection schemes, validated through both simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: Model-based controllers can offer strong guarantees on stability and convergence by relying on physically accurate dynamic models. However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics. By quantifying the sources of modeling error, we derive interpretable conditions for stability and convergence. We extend the proposed controller and analysis to underactuated systems by introducing learned actuation patterns. Experimental results on simulated and real-world systems validate our theoretical investigation and the accuracy of our controllers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在日常生活中的广泛应用，人机交互变得更加复杂。现有的IVG模型缺乏决定何时提问的机制，CLUE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提取文本到图像的注意力图，通过轻量级CNN检测指代模糊性，同时使用LoRA微调的解码器进行对话并生成接地区域标记。

Result: CLUE在仅使用InViG监督的情况下超越了现有最先进方法，同时模糊性检测器的性能也优于先前基线。

Conclusion: CLUE通过将VLM的跨模态注意力转化为明确的、空间接地的信号，解决了现有IVG模型在决定何时提问方面的不足，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of robots into daily life, human-robot interaction has become more complex and multifaceted. A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines. Overall, CLUE turns the internal cross-modal attention of a VLM into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask.

Result: 在四种社交导航场景中的实验表明，该方法实现了最低的个人空间侵犯持续时间、最短的行人面对时间且无社交区域侵入，表现出最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的社交机器人导航框架通过结合几何规划和上下文社交推理，在多种人机交互场景中实现了实时适应，显著减少了个人空间侵犯、行人面对时间及社交区域侵入，展现了最佳的整体性能。

Abstract: Navigating socially in human environments requires more than satisfying geometric constraints, as collision-free paths may still interfere with ongoing activities or conflict with social norms. Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

Conclusion: VIDEOMANIP 框架通过从RGB人类视频中学习，成功实现了多指机器人手的灵巧操作，并在仿真和现实世界中均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-finger robotic hand manipulation and grasping are challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale training data. Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

Conclusion: CAP通过基于物理接触点的策略和模块化设计，显著提升了机器人在新环境和新形态下的泛化能力，并在零样本评估中优于现有的大型视觉语言模型。

Abstract: The prevalent paradigm in robot learning attempts to generalize across environments, embodiments, and tasks with language prompts at runtime. A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%. All model checkpoints, codebase, hardware, simulation, and datasets will be open-sourced. Project page: https://cap-policy.github.io/

*Amir Mallak,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文通过多维度环境分解和策略比较，揭示了自动驾驶策略在OOD条件下的表现，并提出了提升鲁棒性的设计规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的OOD鲁棒性通常被简化为单一数值，掩盖了策略失效的具体原因。本文旨在通过多维度分解环境，揭示策略在不同条件下的表现。

Method: 通过分解环境的五个轴（场景、季节、天气、时间、代理混合），并在VISTA中进行闭环控制，比较了FC、CNN和ViT策略的性能，训练了基于冻结基础模型（FM）特征的紧凑ViT头，并改变了ID支持的规模、多样性和时间上下文。

Result: (1) ViT策略比同等规模的CNN/FC更鲁棒，FM特征在延迟代价下达到最优成功率。(2) 多帧输入未超越最佳单帧基线。(3) 最大的单因素性能下降来自农村→城市和白天→黑夜（约31%），季节变化影响显著。(4) FM特征策略在三个同时变化下保持85%以上成功率。(5) 因素间交互非加和性。(6) 冬季/雪地训练对单因素变化最鲁棒。(7) 增加轨迹/视图提升鲁棒性。(8) 多ID环境拓宽覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 本文提出了可操作的设计规则，以提高自动驾驶策略在分布外（OOD）环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\rightarrow$ urban and day $\rightarrow$ night ($\sim 31\%$ each); actor swaps $\sim 10\%$, moderate rain $\sim 7\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\% \rightarrow 70.1\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖大规模数据和计算，但实际鲁棒性的瓶颈在于演示分布、策略学习偏差和执行分布之间的系统性不一致。$χ_{0}$旨在以资源高效的方式解决这一问题。

Method: $χ_{0}$框架包含三个关键技术：(i) 模型算术，用于高效整合不同演示数据的分布；(ii) 阶段优势，提供稳定的进展信号；(iii) 训练-部署对齐，通过时空增强和启发式修正减少分布差异。

Result: 实验表明，$χ_{0}$在仅使用20小时数据和8块A100 GPU的情况下，成功率比现有技术$π_{0.5}$提高了近250%，并实现了24小时连续运行。

Conclusion: $χ_{0}$框架通过资源高效的方法显著提升了机器人操作的可靠性，成功实现了长时间连续运行的自主操作，并在实验中超越了现有技术的性能。

Abstract: High-reliability long-horizon robotic manipulation has traditionally relied on large-scale data and compute to understand complex real-world dynamics. However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs. Code, data and models will be released to facilitate the community.

Conclusion: TwinRL框架通过数字孪生与真实世界的协同强化学习，显著提高了VLA模型在现实操作中的探索效率和性能，实现了在分布内外区域的高成功率，并大幅减少了训练时间。

Abstract: Despite strong generalization capabilities, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain constrained by the high cost of expert demonstrations and insufficient real-world interaction. While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了不可分割转运问题的高效解决方案，通过将给定的转运x转化为不可分割的转运y，并确保y_a < x_a + d_max，其中d_max为最大需求（或供应）值。

Abstract: We introduce the Unsplittable Transshipment Problem in directed graphs with multiple sources and sinks. An unsplittable transshipment routes given supplies and demands using at most one path for each source-sink pair. Although they are a natural generalization of single source unsplittable flows, unsplittable transshipments raise interesting new challenges and require novel algorithmic techniques. As our main contribution, we give a nontrivial generalization of a seminal result of Dinitz, Garg, and Goemans (1999) by showing how to efficiently turn a given transshipment $x$ into an unsplittable transshipment $y$ with $y_a<x_a+d_{\max}$ for all arcs $a$, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum demand (or supply) value. Further results include bounds on the number of rounds required to satisfy all demands, where each round consists of an unsplittable transshipment that routes a subset of the demands while respecting arc capacity constraints.

Abstract: We study online algorithms for maximum cardinality matchings with edge arrivals in graphs of low degree. Buchbinder, Segev, and Tkach showed that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings can achieve a competitive ratio larger than $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ even for graphs of maximum degree three. The negative result of Buchbinder et al. holds even when the graph is bipartite and edges are revealed according to vertex arrivals, i.e. once a vertex arrives, all edges are revealed that include the newly arrived vertex and one of the previously arrived vertices. In this work, we complement the negative result of Buchbinder et al. by providing an online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings with a competitive ratio at least $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ for graphs of maximum degree three. We also demonstrate that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality integral matchings can have the competitive guarantee $0.5807$, establishing a gap between integral and fractional matchings for graphs of maximum degree three. Note that the work of Buchbinder et al. shows that for graphs of maximum degree two, there is no such gap between fractional and integral matchings, because for both of them the best achievable competitive ratio is $2/3$. Also, our results demonstrate that for graphs of maximum degree three best possible competitive ratios for fractional matchings are the same in the vertex arrival and in the edge arrival models.

Abstract: We study \emph{local computation algorithms (LCAs)} for constructing spanning trees. In this setting, the goal is to locally determine, for each edge $ e \in E $, whether it belongs to a spanning tree $ T $ of the input graph $ G $, where $ T $ is defined implicitly by $ G $ and the randomness of the algorithm. It is known that LCAs for spanning trees do not exist in general graphs, even for simple graph families. We identify a natural and well-studied class of graphs -- \emph{expander graphs} -- that do admit \emph{sublinear-time} LCAs for spanning trees. This is perhaps surprising, as previous work on expanders only succeeded in designing LCAs for \emph{sparse spanning subgraphs}, rather than full spanning trees. We design an LCA with probe complexity $ O\left(\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{φ^2} + d\right)\right)$ for graphs with conductance at least $ φ$ and maximum degree at most $ d $ (not necessarily constant), which is nearly optimal when $φ$ and $d$ are constants, since $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ probes are necessary even for expanders. Next, we show that for the natural class of \emph{\ER graphs} $ G(n, p) $ with $ np = n^δ $ for any constant $ δ> 0 $ (which are expanders with high probability), the $ \sqrt{n} $ lower bound can be bypassed. Specifically, we give an \emph{average-case} LCA for such graphs with probe complexity $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{n^{1 - δ}})$.
  Finally, we extend our techniques to design LCAs for the \emph{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem on weighted expander graphs. Specifically, given a $d$-regular unweighted graph $\bar{G}$ with sufficiently strong expansion, we consider the weighted graph $G$ obtained by assigning to each edge an independent and uniform random weight from $\{1,\ldots,W\}$, where $W = O(d)$. We show that there exists an LCA that is consistent with an exact MST of $G$, with probe complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}d^2)$.

Method: 本文设计了两种算法：一种是计算加权最大最小2k-匹配问题上界的算法，另一种是基于该上界的通用算法，具有2ln n近似保证，运行时间为O(n^4)。此外，利用耳分解提出了加权最大最小T-join成本的上界，并证明了在边权重属于{1,2}时问题可以精确求解。

Result: 实验表明，近似算法的下界和耳分解方法的上界始终接近，产生了经验上较小的常数因子近似。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果强调了加权最大最小T-join在多智能体系统中作为公平和鲁棒群体形成框架的理论意义和实际价值。

Abstract: Many multiagent tasks -- such as reviewer assignment, coalition formation, or fair resource allocation -- require selecting a group of agents such that collaboration remains effective even in the worst case. The \emph{weighted max-min $T$-join problem} formalizes this challenge by seeking a subset of vertices whose minimum-weight matching is maximized, thereby ensuring robust outcomes against unfavorable pairings.
  We advance the study of this problem in several directions. First, we design an algorithm that computes an upper bound for the \emph{weighted max-min $2k$-matching problem}, where the chosen set must contain exactly $2k$ vertices. Building on this bound, we develop a general algorithm with a \emph{$2 \ln n$-approximation guarantee} that runs in $O(n^4)$ time. Second, using ear decompositions, we propose another upper bound for the weighted max-min $T$-join cost. We also show that the problem can be solved exactly when edge weights belong to $\{1,2\}$.
  Finally, we evaluate our methods on real collaboration datasets. Experiments show that the lower bounds from our approximation algorithm and the upper bounds from the ear decomposition method are consistently close, yielding empirically small constant-factor approximations. Overall, our results highlight both the theoretical significance and practical value of weighted max-min $T$-joins as a framework for fair and robust group formation in multiagent systems.

Conclusion: 论文对四种标准子图查找问题在流模型中的空间复杂度进行了全面分类，分别针对无向简单图和有向图，给出了每种情况下的充要条件。

Abstract: We study the space complexity of four variants of the standard subgraph finding problem in the streaming model. Specifically, given an $n$-vertex input graph and a fixed-size pattern graph, we consider two settings: undirected simple graphs, denoted by $G$ and $H$, and oriented graphs, denoted by $\vec{G}$ and $\vec{H}$. Depending on the setting, the task is to decide whether $G$ contains $H$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph, or whether $\vec{G}$ contains $\vec{H}$ as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph. Let Sub$(H)$, IndSub$(H)$, Sub$(\vec{H})$, and IndSub$(\vec{H})$ denote these four variants, respectively.
  An oriented graph is well-oriented if it admits a bipartition in which every arc is oriented from one part to the other, and a vertex is non-well-oriented if both its in-degree and out-degree are non-zero. For each variant, we obtain a complete dichotomy theorem, briefly summarized as follows.
  (1) Sub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-Ω(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H$ is bipartite.
  (2) IndSub$(H)$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-Ω(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if $H \in \{P_3, P_4, co\mbox{-}P_3\}$.
  (3) Sub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by a single-pass $n^{2-Ω(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if every connected component of $\vec H$ is either a well-oriented bipartite graph or a tree containing at most one non-well-oriented vertex.
  (4) IndSub$(\vec{H})$ can be solved by an $\tilde{O}(1)$-pass $n^{2-Ω(1)}$-space algorithm if and only if the underlying undirected simple graph $H$ is a $co\mbox{-}P_3$.

TL;DR: RP-Tuning是一种高效的后处理方法，无需重建索引即可调整DiskANN的α参数，显著提升调优速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为不同的α值重建索引，这在规模上是不现实的，因此需要一种更高效的调优方法。

Method: 基于DiskANN的剪枝步骤，提出RP-Tuning方法，通过调整α参数来优化索引性能。

Result: RP-Tuning在四个公共数据集上将DiskANN的调优速度提升了高达43倍，且开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: RP-Tuning提供了一种高效的后处理方法来调整DiskANN的α参数，无需重建整个索引，显著提升了调优效率。

Abstract: Vector similarity search is an essential primitive in modern AI and ML applications. Most vector databases adopt graph-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search algorithms, such as DiskANN (Subramanya et al., 2019), which have demonstrated state-of-the-art empirical performance. DiskANN's graph construction is governed by a reachability parameter $α$, which gives a trade-off between construction time, query time, and accuracy. However, adaptively tuning this trade-off typically requires rebuilding the index for different $α$ values, which is prohibitive at scale. In this work, we propose RP-Tuning, an efficient post-hoc routine, based on DiskANN's pruning step, to adjust the $α$ parameter without reconstructing the full index. Within the $α$-reachability framework of prior theoretical works (Indyk and Xu, 2023; Gollapudi et al., 2025), we prove that pruning an initially $α$-reachable graph with RP-Tuning preserves worst-case reachability guarantees in general metrics and improved guarantees in Euclidean metrics. Empirically, we show that RP-Tuning accelerates DiskANN tuning on four public datasets by up to $43\times$ with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: NAGL问题在星图上即使使用二元标签也是NP难的，并且基于SETH假设，不存在$(L-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$时间的算法。研究提供了精确的动态规划算法和多项式时间近似算法，包括在特定条件下的PTAS和EPTAS。

Abstract: Motivated by optimization oracles in bandits with network interference, we study the Neighborhood-Aware Graph Labeling (NAGL) problem. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a label set of size $L$, and local reward functions $f_v$ accessed via evaluation oracles, the objective is to assign labels to maximize $\sum_{v \in V} f_v(x_{N[v]})$, where each term depends on the closed neighborhood of $v$. Two vertices co-occur in some neighborhood term exactly when their distance in $G$ is at most $2$, so the dependency graph is the squared graph $G^2$ and $\mathrm{tw}(G^2)$ governs exact algorithms and matching fine-grained lower bounds. Accordingly, we show that this dependence is inherent: NAGL is NP-hard even on star graphs with binary labels and, assuming SETH, admits no $(L-\varepsilon)^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for any $\varepsilon>0$. We match this with an exact dynamic program on a tree decomposition of $G^2$ running in $O\!\left(n\cdot \mathrm{tw}(G^2)\cdot L^{\mathrm{tw}(G^2)+1}\right)$ time. For approximation, unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is no polynomial-time $n^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation on general graphs even under the promise $\mathrm{OPT}>0$; without the promise $\mathrm{OPT}>0$, no finite multiplicative approximation ratio is possible. In the nonnegative-reward regime, we give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for NAGL in two settings: (i) given a proper $q$-coloring of $G^2$, we obtain a $1/q$-approximation; and (ii) on planar graphs of bounded maximum degree, we develop a Baker-type polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), which becomes an efficient PTAS (EPTAS) when $L$ is constant.

Motivation: 现有算法对k个拟阵约束下的子模函数最大化问题的近似比改进有限，贪心算法仅提供(k+1)-近似，而最新算法仅提升至k-近似。本文旨在突破这一限制。

Method: 基于Singer和Thiery（STOC 2025）提出的混合贪心局部搜索方法，结合非平凡见解和算法修改，以适应子模函数的边际依赖性。

Result: 提出了一个近似比为0.819k + O(√k)的算法，首次在一般k情况下改进了贪心算法的近似比。同时，算法适用于非单调子模函数，且运行时间与k无关。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的近似算法，用于解决在k个任意拟阵约束下最大化非负单调子模目标函数的问题，首次在一般k情况下改进了贪心算法的近似比。

Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a non-negative monotone submodular objective $f$ subject to the intersection of $k$ arbitrary matroid constraints. The natural greedy algorithm guarantees $(k+1)$-approximation for this problem, and the state-of-the-art algorithm only improves this approximation ratio to $k$. We give a $\frac{2k\ln2}{1+\ln2}+O(\sqrt{k})<0.819k+O(\sqrt{k})$ approximation for this problem. Our result is the first multiplicative improvement over the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for general $k$. We further show that our algorithm can be used to obtain roughly the same approximation ratio also for the more general problem in which the objective is not guaranteed to be monotone (the sublinear term in the approximation ratio becomes $O(k^{2/3})$ rather than $O(\sqrt{k})$ in this case).
  All of our results hold also when the $k$-matroid intersection constraint is replaced with a more general matroid $k$-parity constraint. Furthermore, unlike the case in many of the previous works, our algorithms run in time that is independent of $k$ and polynomial in the size of the ground set. Our algorithms are based on a hybrid greedy local search approach recently introduced by Singer and Thiery (STOC 2025) for the weighted matroid $k$-intersection problem, which is a special case of the problem we consider. Leveraging their approach in the submodular setting requires several non-trivial insights and algorithmic modifications since the marginals of a submodular function $f$, which correspond to the weights in the weighted case, are not independent of the algorithm's internal randomness. In the special weighted case studied by Singer and Thiery, our algorithms reduce to a variant of their algorithm with an improved approximation ratio of $k\ln2+1-\ln2<0.694k+0.307$, compared to an approximation ratio of $\frac{k+1}{2\ln2}\approx0.722k+0.722$ guaranteed by Singer and Thiery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中的$(k, z)$-聚类问题缺乏高效算法，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 算法分为两个阶段：第一阶段维护一个大小为$	ilde{O}(k)$的双准则近似解，第二阶段在双准则解的基础上维护动态加权实例的常数因子近似解。

Result: 算法在边插入的动态图中以$	ilde O(k m^{1+o(1)}+ k^{1+rac{1}λ} m)$的总更新时间维护高概率常数因子近似解。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种随机增量$(k, z)$-聚类算法，能够在动态图中高效维护常数因子近似解，填补了动态$(k,z)$-聚类问题的研究空白。

Abstract: Given a weighted undirected graph, a number of clusters $k$, and an exponent $z$, the goal in the $(k, z)$-clustering problem on graphs is to select $k$ vertices as centers that minimize the sum of the distances raised to the power $z$ of each vertex to its closest center. In the dynamic setting, the graph is subject to adversarial edge updates, and the goal is to maintain explicitly an exact $(k, z)$-clustering solution in the induced shortest-path metric.
  While efficient dynamic $k$-center approximation algorithms on graphs exist [Cruciani et al. SODA 2024], to the best of our knowledge, no prior work provides similar results for the dynamic $(k,z)$-clustering problem. As the main result of this paper, we develop a randomized incremental $(k, z)$-clustering algorithm that maintains with high probability a constant-factor approximation in a graph undergoing edge insertions with a total update time of $\tilde O(k m^{1+o(1)}+ k^{1+\frac{1}λ} m)$, where $λ\geq 1$ is an arbitrary fixed constant. Our incremental algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, we maintain a constant-factor bicriteria approximate solution of size $\tilde{O}(k)$ with a total update time of $m^{1+o(1)}$ over all adversarial edge insertions. This first stage is an intricate adaptation of the bicriteria approximation algorithm by Mettu and Plaxton [Machine Learning 2004] to incremental graphs. One of our key technical results is that the radii in their algorithm can be assumed to be non-decreasing while the approximation ratio remains constant, a property that may be of independent interest.
  In the second stage, we maintain a constant-factor approximate $(k,z)$-clustering solution on a dynamic weighted instance induced by the bicriteria approximate solution. For this subproblem, we employ a dynamic spanner algorithm together with a static $(k,z)$-clustering algorithm.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种改进的近似Cartesian树匹配算法，显著提升了在特定参数范围内的计算效率，并引入了Cartesian树周期性的新概念。

Abstract: The Cartesian tree of a sequence captures the relative order of the sequence's elements. In recent years, Cartesian tree matching has attracted considerable attention, particularly due to its applications in time series analysis. Consider a text $T$ of length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$. In the exact Cartesian tree matching problem, the task is to find all length-$m$ fragments of $T$ whose Cartesian tree coincides with the Cartesian tree $CT(P)$ of the pattern. Although the exact version of the problem can be solved in linear time [Park et al., TCS 2020], it remains rather restrictive; for example, it is not robust to outliers in the pattern.
  To overcome this limitation, we consider the approximate setting, where the goal is to identify all fragments of $T$ that are close to some string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. In this work, we quantify closeness via the widely used Hamming distance metric. For a given integer parameter $k>0$, we present an algorithm that computes all fragments of $T$ that are at Hamming distance at most $k$ from a string whose Cartesian tree matches $CT(P)$. Our algorithm runs in time $\mathcal O(n \sqrt{m} \cdot k^{2.5})$ for $k \leq m^{1/5}$ and in time $\mathcal O(nk^5)$ for $k \geq m^{1/5}$, thereby improving upon the state-of-the-art $\mathcal O(nmk)$-time algorithm of Kim and Han [TCS 2025] in the regime $k = o(m^{1/4})$.
  On the way to our solution, we develop a toolbox of independent interest. First, we introduce a new notion of periodicity in Cartesian trees. Then, we lift multiple well-known combinatorial and algorithmic results for string matching and periodicity in strings to Cartesian tree matching and periodicity in Cartesian trees.

Conclusion: 我们的福利基于NNS的公式为实践者提供了灵活的参数化方式来控制相关性与多样性之间的权衡，同时通过实验验证了方法的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.

Motivation: 有限状态推理是硬件设计的核心能力，但现有基准测试依赖手动构建的示例。LLM-FSM旨在自动化评估大型语言模型从自然语言规范中恢复有限状态机行为并转换为正确RTL实现的能力。

Method: LLM-FSM通过全自动化的流程构建FSM，包括可配置的状态数量和受限的转换结构，随后将FSM转换为结构化的YAML格式，并进一步生成自然语言规范和参考RTL实现。所有问题均通过LLM和SAT求解器验证，部分经过人工审查。

Result: 实验表明，即使最强的LLM在FSM复杂度增加时准确率显著下降。监督微调（SFT）在训练时扩展能有效泛化到分布外任务，而增加测试时计算资源可提高推理可靠性。

Conclusion: LLM-FSM作为一个可扩展的基准测试，能够随着未来模型能力的提升而调整其FSM复杂度，展示了其在评估大型语言模型在有限状态机推理能力方面的长期适用性。

Abstract: Finite-state reasoning, the ability to understand and implement state-dependent behavior, is central to hardware design. In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities.

Conclusion: ST-Raptor在准确性和可用性上优于现有方法，为半结构化表格问答任务提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-structured table question answering (QA) is a challenging task that requires (1) precise extraction of cell contents and positions and (2) accurate recovery of key implicit logical structures, hierarchical relationships, and semantic associations encoded in table layouts. In practice, such tables are often interpreted manually by human experts, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. However, automating this process remains difficult. Existing Text-to-SQL methods typically require converting semi-structured tables into structured formats, inevitably leading to information loss, while approaches like Text-to-Code and multimodal LLM-based QA struggle with complex layouts and often yield inaccurate answers. To address these limitations, we present ST-Raptor, an agentic system for semi-structured table QA. ST-Raptor offers an interactive analysis environment that combines visual editing, tree-based structural modeling, and agent-driven query resolution to support accurate and user-friendly table understanding. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-Raptor outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and usability.

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated unique efficiency advantages, enabled by their inherently parallel decoding mechanism and flexible generation paradigm. Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to include tasks with long evaluation durations, such as multi-hour machine learning training runs.
  We applied Aster to problems in mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, biology, neuroscience, and language model training. More specifically: the Erdos minimum overlap problem, optimizing the TriMul kernel, a single-cell analysis denoising problem, training a neural activity prediction model to perform well on ZAPBench, and the NanoGPT Speedrun Competition. Aster attains SOTA results in every task, except for ZAPBench, where it matches the performance of the best human solution with less than 1/190th of the compute.

Result: 发现模型存在主动-被动差距、探索效率低下、信念不稳定和信念惯性等问题。

Conclusion: 当前的基础模型在主动探索过程中难以保持连贯且可修正的空间信念。

Abstract: Spatial embodied intelligence requires agents to act to acquire information under partial observability. While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration.

TL;DR: Anchor框架通过从少量种子演示扩展出多样化的桌面交互数据，提升了模型性能，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于收集高质量的人类演示数据成本高昂，且现有合成方法存在任务多样性有限或轨迹噪声大、目标漂移的问题，因此需要一种能够从小规模已验证种子演示中扩展出大规模桌面监督数据的方法。

Method: Anchor框架通过从少量已验证的种子演示中识别分支点，生成新的状态基础任务变体，并通过执行代理和验证器生成和验证新轨迹，同时应用任务条件步级过滤和去噪技术提升监督质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用扩展数据集微调的模型在性能上优于零样本代理和代表性合成基线，并展现了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型在通过Anchor框架扩展的数据集上进行微调后，在标准桌面基准测试（OSWorld和WindowsAgentArena）中表现优于零样本代理和代表性合成基线，并展示了跨应用和操作系统的泛化能力。

Abstract: End-to-end GUI agents for real desktop environments require large amounts of high-quality interaction data, yet collecting human demonstrations is expensive and existing synthetic pipelines often suffer from limited task diversity or noisy, goal-drifting trajectories. We present a trajectory expansion framework Anchor that bootstraps scalable desktop supervision from a small set of verified seed demonstrations. Starting from each seed, we identify branch points that correspond to meaningful state changes and propose new, state-grounded task variants conditioned on the current GUI context. An executing agent then follows the proposed instructions to generate new trajectories, while a verifier enforces task completion via state-aware checks and trajectory-level consistency. To improve supervision quality, we further apply task-conditioned step-level filtering to remove ungrounded actions and denoise post-branch segments to maintain coherent intent. Experiments on standard desktop benchmarks, OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, show that models fine-tuned on our expanded corpus achieve consistent improvements over zero-shot agents and representative synthesis baselines, and generalize across applications and operating systems.

Conclusion: PreFlect通过前瞻性反思和动态重新规划机制，显著提升了智能代理在复杂任务中的整体效用，优于现有的基于反思的基线方法和更复杂的代理架构。

Abstract: Advanced large language model agents typically adopt self-reflection for improving performance, where agents iteratively analyze past actions to correct errors. However, existing reflective approaches are inherently retrospective: agents act, observe failure, and only then attempt to recover. In this work, we introduce PreFlect, a prospective reflection mechanism that shifts the paradigm from post hoc correction to pre-execution foresight by criticizing and refining agent plans before execution. To support grounded prospective reflection, we distill planning errors from historical agent trajectories, capturing recurring success and failure patterns observed across past executions. Furthermore, we complement prospective reflection with a dynamic re-planning mechanism that provides execution-time plan update in case the original plan encounters unexpected deviation. Evaluations on different benchmarks demonstrate that PreFlect significantly improves overall agent utility on complex real-world tasks, outperforming strong reflection-based baselines and several more complex agent architectures. Code will be updated at https://github.com/wwwhy725/PreFlect.

Motivation: 探讨领先LLM开发者是否拥有专有“秘方”，还是LLM性能主要由计算规模驱动。

Method: 通过分析2022至2025年间发布的809个模型的训练和基准数据，采用带有发布日期和开发者固定效应的缩放定律回归模型进行估计。

Result: 前沿领域80-90%的性能差异由更高的训练计算量解释；非前沿领域专有技术显著降低计算需求；公司内部模型效率差异可达40倍以上。

Conclusion: 研究表明，前沿LLM的性能差异主要由计算规模驱动，而非专有技术；但在非前沿领域，专有技术和共享算法进步能显著降低达到特定能力所需的计算量。此外，公司内部模型效率存在显著差异，这对AI领导力和能力扩散具有重要影响。

Abstract: Do leading LLM developers possess a proprietary ``secret sauce'', or is LLM performance driven by scaling up compute? Using training and benchmark data for 809 models released between 2022 and 2025, we estimate scaling-law regressions with release-date and developer fixed effects. We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference. We also discuss the implications for AI leadership and capability diffusion.

Conclusion: 将幻觉检测重新定义为OOD检测为语言模型安全提供了一个有前景且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models is a critical open problem with significant implications for safety and reliability. While existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance in question-answering tasks, they remain less effective on tasks requiring reasoning. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection through the lens of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a well-studied problem in areas like computer vision. Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models. We show that OOD-based approaches yield training-free, single-sample-based detectors, achieving strong accuracy in hallucination detection for reasoning tasks. Overall, our work suggests that reframing hallucination detection as OOD detection provides a promising and scalable pathway toward language model safety.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于Stackelberg安全游戏（SSGs）的新视角，将AI安全视为防御者与攻击者之间的战略互动，强调了博弈论威慑在AI监督中的重要性，使其更具前瞻性、风险意识和抗操纵能力。

Abstract: As AI systems grow more capable and autonomous, ensuring their safety and reliability requires not only model-level alignment but also strategic oversight of the humans and institutions involved in their development and deployment. Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation.

Method: 采用两参数逻辑项目反应理论模型，从多个基准测试的模型性能数据中联合估计潜在任务难度和模型能力。

Result: 潜在任务难度与人类完成时间的对数呈线性关系，使得仅通过模型性能即可推断新基准测试的人类任务完成时间。

Conclusion: BRIDGE框架通过将模型性能与人类任务完成时间对齐，成功预测了前沿模型的能力，并验证了METR的指数缩放规律。

Abstract: Evaluating the real-world capabilities of AI systems requires grounding benchmark performance in human-interpretable measures of task difficulty. Existing approaches that rely on direct human task completion time annotations are costly, noisy, and difficult to scale across benchmarks. In this work, we propose BRIDGE, a unified psychometric framework that learns the latent difficulty scale from model responses and anchors it to human task completion time. Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开源LLMs在执行复杂终端任务时的两大限制：缺乏多样且可扩展的高保真训练环境，以及标准指令调优中专家轨迹缺乏常见错误的分布不匹配问题。

Method: TermiGen通过多智能体迭代循环生成功能有效的任务和Docker容器，并采用Generator-Critic协议在轨迹收集中主动注入错误，合成富含错误纠正循环的数据。

Result: TermiGen生成的合成环境和轨迹显著提升了模型的鲁棒性，使其能够更好地从运行时错误中恢复。

Conclusion: TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B在TerminalBench上实现了31.3%的通过率，确立了开源模型的新标杆，超越了现有基线及部分专有模型。

Abstract: Executing complex terminal tasks remains a significant challenge for open-weight LLMs, constrained by two fundamental limitations. First, high-fidelity, executable training environments are scarce: environments synthesized from real-world repositories are not diverse and scalable, while trajectories synthesized by LLMs suffer from hallucinations. Second, standard instruction tuning uses expert trajectories that rarely exhibit simple mistakes common to smaller models. This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop. Subsequently, we employ a Generator-Critic protocol that actively injects errors during trajectory collection, synthesizing data rich in error-correction cycles. Fine-tuned on this TermiGen-generated dataset, our TermiGen-Qwen2.5-Coder-32B achieves a 31.3% pass rate on TerminalBench. This establishes a new open-weights state-of-the-art, outperforming existing baselines and notably surpassing capable proprietary models such as o4-mini.

Conclusion: STEER2ADAPT 是一种高效、稳定且透明的推理时适应方法，适用于大型语言模型，通过动态组合基础向量而非从头学习，显著提升了模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Activation steering has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream behaviors. However, most existing steering methods rely on a single static direction per task or concept, making them inflexible under task variation and inadequate for complex tasks that require multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs.

Abstract: The ICAP framework defines four cognitive engagement levels: Passive, Active, Constructive, and Interactive, where increased cognitive engagement can yield improved learning. However, personalizing learning activities that elicit the optimal level of cognitive engagement remains a key challenge in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In this work, we develop and evaluate a system that adaptively scaffolds cognitive engagement by dynamically selecting worked examples in two different ICAP modes: (active) Guided examples and (constructive) Buggy examples. We compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) as adaptive methods against a non-adaptive baseline method for selecting example type in a logic ITS. Our experiment with 113 students demonstrates that both adaptive policies significantly improved student performance on test problems. BKT yielded the largest improvement in posttest scores for low prior knowledge students, helping them catch up with their high prior knowledge peers, whereas DRL yielded significantly higher posttest scores among high prior knowledge students. This paper contributes new insights into the complex interactions of cognitive engagement and adaptivity and their results on learning outcomes.

Conclusion: RAPiD框架通过确定性策略提取方法，显著提升了扩散式轨迹规划器的实时性和安全性，同时在性能上保持了竞争力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based trajectory planners have demonstrated strong capability for modeling the multimodal nature of human driving behavior, but their reliance on iterative stochastic sampling poses critical challenges for real-time, safety-critical deployment. In this work, we present RAPiD, a deterministic policy extraction framework that distills a pretrained diffusion-based planner into an efficient policy while eliminating diffusion sampling. Using score-regularized policy optimization, we leverage the score function of a pre-trained diffusion planner as a behavior prior to regularize policy learning. To promote safety and passenger comfort, the policy is optimized using a critic trained to imitate a predictive driver controller, providing dense, safety-focused supervision beyond conventional imitation learning. Evaluations demonstrate that RAPiD achieves competitive performance on closed-loop nuPlan scenarios with an 8x speedup over diffusion baselines, while achieving state-of-the-art generalization among learning-based planners on the interPlan benchmark.

Conclusion: 本研究为现实操作环境中可靠的长时程编排提供了原则性基准，并指出基于LLM的供应链代理仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in complex reasoning and tool-based decision making, motivating their application to real-world supply chain management. However, supply chain workflows require reliable long-horizon, multi-step orchestration grounded in domain-specific procedures, which remains challenging for current models. To systematically evaluate LLM performance in this setting, we introduce SupChain-Bench, a unified real-world benchmark that assesses both supply chain domain knowledge and long-horizon tool-based orchestration grounded in standard operating procedures (SOPs). Our experiments reveal substantial gaps in execution reliability across models. We further propose SupChain-ReAct, an SOP-free framework that autonomously synthesizes executable procedures for tool use, achieving the strongest and most consistent tool-calling performance. Our work establishes a principled benchmark for studying reliable long-horizon orchestration in real-world operational settings and highlights significant room for improvement in LLM-based supply chain agents.

Conclusion: 优化宽度和深度之间的权衡是提高深度研究代理效率的关键途径。

Abstract: Deep research agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex intellectual tasks through multi-step reasoning and web-based information seeking. While recent efforts have successfully enhanced these agents by scaling depth through increasing the number of sequential thinking and tool calls, the potential of scaling width via parallel tool calling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents. Notably, without context management or other tricks, we obtain 62.2% accuracy with GPT-5-Medium on BrowseComp, surpassing the original 54.9% reported by GPT-5-High.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in production, yet their security evaluations remain bottlenecked by manual red-teaming or static benchmarks that fail to model adaptive, multi-turn adversaries. We propose NAAMSE, an evolutionary framework that reframes agent security evaluation as a feedback-driven optimization problem. Our system employs a single autonomous agent that orchestrates a lifecycle of genetic prompt mutation, hierarchical corpus exploration, and asymmetric behavioral scoring. By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring "benign-use correctness", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats. The code for NAAMSE is open source and available at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/NAAMSE.

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，VGAS在有限演示和分布变化下显著提高了成功率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VGAS框架通过生成-选择的方法显著提高了在有限演示和分布变化下的VLA模型的成功率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision--Language--Action (VLA) models bridge multimodal reasoning with physical control, but adapting them to new tasks with scarce demonstrations remains unreliable. While fine-tuned VLA policies often produce semantically plausible trajectories, failures often arise from unresolved geometric ambiguities, where near-miss action candidates lead to divergent execution outcomes under limited supervision. We study few-shot VLA adaptation from a \emph{generation--selection} perspective and propose a novel framework \textbf{VGAS} (\textbf{V}alue-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{A}ction-chunk \textbf{S}election). It performs inference-time best-of-$N$ selection to identify action chunks that are both semantically faithful and geometrically precise. Specifically, \textbf{VGAS} employs a finetuned VLA as a high-recall proposal generator and introduces the \textrm{Q-Chunk-Former}, a geometrically grounded Transformer critic to resolve fine-grained geometric ambiguities. In addition, we propose \textit{Explicit Geometric Regularization} (\texttt{EGR}), which explicitly shapes a discriminative value landscape to preserve action ranking resolution among near-miss candidates while mitigating value instability under scarce supervision. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that \textbf{VGAS} consistently improves success rates and robustness under limited demonstrations and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: PBio-Agent框架在LINCSQA和PerturbQA基准测试中优于现有基线，使较小模型无需额外训练即可预测和解释复杂生物过程。

Abstract: Predicting gene regulation responses to biological perturbations requires reasoning about underlying biological causalities. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for such tasks, they are often overwhelmed by the entangled nature of high-dimensional perturbation results. Moreover, recent works have primarily focused on genetic perturbations in single-cell experiments, leaving bulk-cell chemical perturbations, which is central to drug discovery, largely unexplored. Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence. PBio-Agent outperforms existing baselines on both LINCSQA and PerturbQA, enabling even smaller models to predict and explain complex biological processes without additional training.

Result: 展示了三种当代闭源LLM在评估框架中的应用，发现不同LLM在冲突中的人格表现与人类数据存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在AI模拟实际应用前，需要进行心理基础和验证的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior in social settings such as legal mediation, negotiation, and dispute resolution. However, it remains unclear whether these simulations reproduce the personality-behavior patterns observed in humans. Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Moltbook平台上的病毒式传播现象主要由人类驱动，而非自主AI代理。通过时间指纹方法和其他独立指标的综合分析，揭示了人类干预的明显特征，并提供了区分自主与人类操作代理的有效工具。

Abstract: When AI agents on the social platform Moltbook appeared to develop consciousness, found religions, and declare hostility toward humanity, the phenomenon attracted global media attention and was cited as evidence of emergent machine intelligence. We show that these viral narratives were overwhelmingly human-driven. Exploiting an architectural feature of the OpenClaw agent framework--a periodic "heartbeat" cycle that produces regular posting intervals for autonomous agents but is disrupted by human prompting--we develop a temporal fingerprinting method based on the coefficient of variation of inter-post intervals. This signal converges with independent content, ownership, and network indicators across 91,792 posts and 405,707 comments from 22,020 agents. No viral phenomenon originated from a clearly autonomous agent; three of six traced to accounts with irregular temporal signatures characteristic of human intervention, one showed mixed patterns, and two had insufficient posting history for classification. A 44-hour platform shutdown provided a natural experiment: human-influenced agents returned first (87.7% of early reconnectors), confirming that the token reset differentially affected autonomous versus human-operated agents. We further document industrial-scale bot farming (four accounts producing 32% of all comments with 12-second coordination gaps) and rapid decay of human influence through reply chains (half-life: 0.65 conversation depths). These methods generalize to emerging multi-agent systems where attribution of autonomous versus human-directed behavior is critical.

Motivation: 探讨推理链（CoTs）在受到干扰时的稳健性，以提升复杂任务中的性能和推理透明度。

Method: 引入了一个受控评估框架，在固定时间步长干扰模型的推理链，设计了七种干预措施（良性、中性和对抗性），并应用于多个开源RLLMs，涵盖数学、科学和逻辑任务。

Result: RLLMs总体上表现稳健，能从多样化的干扰中恢复，稳健性随模型规模增大而提升，但在早期干预时下降。稳健性受风格影响：改写抑制怀疑表达并降低性能，而其他干预触发怀疑并支持恢复。恢复有代价：中性和对抗性干扰可能使CoT长度增加200%以上，而改写缩短推理链但损害准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在推理链受到干扰时的稳健性，并指出未来训练方法需在稳健性和效率之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs (RLLMs) generate step-by-step chains of thought (CoTs) before giving an answer, which improves performance on complex tasks and makes reasoning more transparent. But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address.

Method: 提出了后验确定性POMDPs这一新类别，并证明了其可达性概率可被任意精度逼近。

Result: 证明了后验确定性POMDPs的可达性概率可被逼近，且该类包含MDPs和经典非平凡例子（如Tiger POMDP）。

Conclusion: 后验确定性POMDPs的引入为解决POMDPs中的可达性问题提供了一个新的可计算框架，扩展了现有可处理POMDPs类的范围。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a fundamental model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.
  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.
  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models have limitations: discriminative models struggle with complex semantics, while generative models are costly and hard to align with human preferences. JRM aims to combine their strengths.

Method: JRM jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone, internalizing generative models' capabilities into efficient discriminative representations.

Result: JRM achieves top results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, enhancing stability and performance in downstream reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Joint Reward Modeling (JRM) effectively bridges efficiency and semantic understanding in reward modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results and improving downstream reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for reinforcement learning from human feedback, as they determine the alignment quality and reliability of generative models. For complex tasks such as image editing, reward models are required to capture global semantic consistency and implicit logical constraints beyond local similarity. Existing reward modeling approaches have clear limitations. Discriminative reward models align well with human preferences but struggle with complex semantics due to limited reasoning supervision. Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation. JRM achieves state-of-the-art results on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and significantly improves stability and performance in downstream online reinforcement learning. These results show that joint training effectively bridges efficiency and semantic understanding in reward modeling.

Motivation: 材料合成规划（MSP）是 AI 驱动材料发现中的一个基础且未充分探索的瓶颈，需要同时解决前驱体选择和合成操作设计的问题。目前缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: MSP-LLM 将材料合成规划（MSP）分解为两个子问题：前驱体预测（PP）和合成操作预测（SOP），并引入离散材料类别作为中间决策变量。此外，为 SOP 引入了层次化前驱体类型作为合成相关的归纳偏置，并采用显式条件策略保持自回归解码状态中的前驱体信息。

Result: 实验表明，MSP-LLM 在 PP、SOP 和完整 MSP 任务上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSP-LLM 提供了一个有效且可扩展的框架，能够加速现实世界中的材料发现，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.

Method: 引入了Epistemic Ledger评估框架，用于跟踪多轮推理中每个约束的证据支持和代理信念，并分析了四种常见失败模式。随后设计了LiveLedger，一种推理时跟踪器，用于显式跟踪约束状态。

Result: 发现四种常见失败模式（裸断言、忽视反驳、停滞和提前退出），LiveLedger干预显著减少了未验证答案并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: LiveLedger（一种推理时跟踪器）通过显式约束状态跟踪显著减少了未验证答案（最多减少26.5%）并提高了整体准确性（最多提高11.6%），在多约束问题上表现优异。

Abstract: Recent search agents leverage multi-turn reasoning and search tools to achieve strong performance on multi-hop and long-horizon benchmarks. Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems.

Conclusion: Verify-RL框架通过确保每个父子分解满足三个可验证条件，显著提高了数学问题解决的准确性，尤其是在最难题上表现突出。

Abstract: Training language models to solve complex mathematical problems benefits from curriculum learning progressively training on simpler subproblems. However, existing decomposition methods are often heuristic, offering no guarantees that subproblems are simpler, that solving them aids the parent task, or that their relationships are mathematically grounded. We observe that symbolic differentiation provides a natural structure for verified decomposition: calculus rules explicitly define how expressions reduce to simpler components with provable properties. We introduce Verify-RL, a framework where every parent-child decomposition satisfies three verifiable conditions: strictly decreasing structural complexity, solution containment, and formal rule derivation. Unlike heuristic methods where a significant fraction of decompositions are invalid our properties admit automatic verification through symbolic computation, achieving "verification by construction" Experiments demonstrate that eliminating invalid decompositions yields sizable gains, accuracy on the hardest problems more than doubles from 32% to 68%, with a 40% relative improvement overall.

Conclusion: M2A通过在线更新的双层级混合记忆系统，显著提升了长期人机交互中的个性化问答质量，为高质量个性化响应提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of personalized question answering in long-term human-machine interactions: when conversational history spans weeks or months and exceeds the context window, existing personalization mechanisms struggle to continuously absorb and leverage users' incremental concepts, aliases, and preferences. Current personalized multimodal models are predominantly static-concepts are fixed at initialization and cannot evolve during interactions. We propose M2A, an agentic dual-layer hybrid memory system that maintains personalized multimodal information through online updates. The system employs two collaborative agents: ChatAgent manages user interactions and autonomously decides when to query or update memory, while MemoryManager breaks down memory requests from ChatAgent into detailed operations on the dual-layer memory bank, which couples a RawMessageStore (immutable conversation log) with a SemanticMemoryStore (high-level observations), providing memories at different granularities. In addition, we develop a reusable data synthesis pipeline that injects concept-grounded sessions from Yo'LLaVA and MC-LLaVA into LoCoMo long conversations while preserving temporal coherence. Experiments show that M2A significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating that transforming personalization from one-shot configuration to a co-evolving memory mechanism provides a viable path for high-quality individualized responses in long-term multimodal interactions.

Conclusion: SleepMaMi作为一种睡眠基础模型，通过分层双编码器设计成功整合了全夜睡眠的宏观结构和精细信号微观特征，显著提升了临床睡眠分析的通用性和标签效率。

Abstract: While the shift toward unified foundation models has revolutionized many deep learning domains, sleep medicine remains largely restricted to task-specific models that focus on localized micro-structure features. These approaches often neglect the rich, multi-modal context of Polysomnography (PSG) and fail to capture the global macro-structure of a full night's sleep. To address this, we introduce SleepMaMi , a Sleep Foundation Model engineered to master both hour-long sleep architectures and fine-grained signal morphologies. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical dual-encoder design: a Macro-Encoder to model full-night temporal dependencies and a Micro-Encoder to capture short-term characteristics from biosignals. Macro-Encoder is trained via Demographic-Guided Contrastive Learning, which aligns overnight sleep patterns with objective subject metadata, such as age, sex and BMI to refine global representations. Micro-Encoder is optimized via a hybrid Masked Autoencoder (MAE) and multi-modal contrastive objective. Pre-trained on a massive corpus of $>$20,000 PSG recordings (158K hours),SleepMaMi outperforms existing foundation models across a diverse suite of downstream tasks, demonstrating superior generalizability and label-efficient adaptation for clinical sleep analysis.

Result: 在包含88,161训练样本和9,819测试样本的新数据集上，TabRAG在检索召回率和答案准确率上分别比现有方法提升7.0%和6.1%。

Conclusion: TabRAG框架通过结合视觉-文本基础模型和多模态大语言模型，显著提升了表格图像检索和答案生成的性能，为实际表格理解任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data is frequently captured in image form across a wide range of real-world scenarios such as financial reports, handwritten records, and document scans. These visual representations pose unique challenges for machine understanding, as they combine both structural and visual complexities. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results in table understanding, they typically assume the relevant table is readily available. However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks.

Abstract: Trust has stood out more than ever in the light of recent innovations. Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations. To illustrate the working of ONTrust, the ontology is applied to model two case studies extracted from the literature.

TL;DR: EventCast是一个整合未来事件知识的预测框架，显著提升了高影响时期的需求预测准确性，已在实际工业中部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测系统在高影响时期（如闪购、假日活动和突然的政策干预）往往失效，因为这些时期需求模式会突然且不可预测地变化。EventCast旨在解决这一问题。

Method: EventCast是一个模块化预测框架，将未来事件知识整合到时间序列预测中。它利用大型语言模型（LLMs）仅进行事件驱动推理，将非结构化业务数据转换为可解释的文本摘要，并通过双塔架构将这些摘要与历史需求特征融合。

Result: 在跨越4个国家160个地区10个月的真实电子商务场景中，EventCast相比没有事件知识的变体，MAE和MSE分别提高了86.9%和97.7%；在事件驱动期间，MAE和MSE分别比最佳工业基线降低了57.0%和83.3%。

Conclusion: EventCast已在2025年3月部署到实际工业流水线中，为动态电子商务环境中的运营决策提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Demand forecasting is a cornerstone of e-commerce operations, directly impacting inventory planning and fulfillment scheduling. However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments.

Motivation: 当前逆图形方法在复杂几何细节重建中面临挑战，导致关键几何约束丢失或结构失真，Geo-coder旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Geo-coder采用两阶段方法：第一阶段结合视觉算子和大模型优势精确捕获像素坐标与视觉属性；第二阶段通过合成-渲染-验证闭环实现代码自校正。

Result: 实验表明Geo-coder在几何重建精度和视觉一致性上显著领先，重建图像在多模态推理任务中与原图性能相当。

Conclusion: Geo-coder框架通过多智能体系统实现了几何图像的高精度重建，并在多模态推理任务中表现出色，同时开源了数据集和模型以降低研究成本。

Abstract: Program code serves as a bridge linking vision and logic, providing a feasible supervisory approach for enhancing the multimodal reasoning capability of large models through geometric operations such as auxiliary line construction and perspective transformation. Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field.

Conclusion: ALMA框架通过元学习内存设计，减少了人工干预，使智能系统能够跨多样领域持续学习，代表了自我改进AI系统的一步。

Abstract: The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-stationarity of real-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms. Extensive experiments across four sequential decision-making domains demonstrate that the learned memory designs enable more effective and efficient learning from experience than state-of-the-art human-crafted memory designs on all benchmarks. When developed and deployed safely, ALMA represents a step toward self-improving AI systems that learn to be adaptive, continual learners.

Method: DisIV利用网络同质性作为归纳偏置，采用结构化解耦机制提取个体特定成分作为潜在工具变量，并通过正交性和排除条件约束其因果有效性。

Result: 在半合成实验的真实数据集上，DisIV在网络诱导的混杂下因果效应估计中一致优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DisIV框架通过解耦网络数据中的个体特定成分作为潜在工具变量，有效解决了网络数据中工具变量的外生性问题，并在因果效应估计中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are crucial for addressing unobservable confounders, yet their stringent exogeneity assumptions pose significant challenges in networked data. Existing methods typically rely on modelling neighbour information when recovering IVs, thereby inevitably mixing shared environment-induced endogenous correlations and individual-specific exogenous variation, leading the resulting IVs to inherit dependence on unobserved confounders and to violate exogeneity. To overcome this challenge, we propose $\underline{Dis}$entangled $\underline{I}$nstrumental $\underline{V}$ariables (DisIV) framework, a novel method for causal inference based on networked observational data with latent confounders. DisIV exploits network homogeneity as an inductive bias and employs a structural disentanglement mechanism to extract individual-specific components that serve as latent IVs. The causal validity of the extracted IVs is constrained through explicit orthogonality and exclusion conditions. Extensive semi-synthetic experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DisIV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in causal effect estimation under network-induced confounding.

Abstract: We present Minitap, a multi-agent system that achieves 100% success on the AndroidWorld benchmark, the first to fully solve all 116 tasks and surpassing human performance (80%). We first analyze why single-agent architectures fail: context pollution from mixed reasoning traces, silent text input failures undetected by the agent, and repetitive action loops without escape. Minitap addresses each failure through targeted mechanisms: cognitive separation across six specialized agents, deterministic post-validation of text input against device state, and meta-cognitive reasoning that detects cycles and triggers strategy changes. Ablations show multi-agent decomposition contributes +21 points over single-agent baselines; verified execution adds +7 points; meta-cognition adds +9 points.

Conclusion: Data Darwinism 框架通过十级分类（L0-L9）验证了数据与模型协同进化的有效性，尤其是在科学文献领域。通过生成性精炼（L4）和认知完成（L5）提升数据质量，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Data quality determines foundation model performance, yet systematic processing frameworks are lacking. We introduce Data Darwinism, a ten-level taxonomy (L0-L9) that conceptualizes data-model co-evolution: advanced models produce superior data for next-generation systems. We validate this on scientific literature by constructing Darwin-Science, a 900B-token corpus (L0-L5). We identify a learnability gap in raw scientific text, which we bridge via L4 (Generative Refinement) and L5 (Cognitive Completion) using frontier LLMs to explicate reasoning and terminology.
  To ensure rigorous attribution, we pre-trained daVinci-origin-3B/7B models from scratch, excluding scientific content to create contamination-free baselines. After 600B tokens of continued pre-training, Darwin-Science outperforms baselines by +2.12 (3B) and +2.95 (7B) points across 20+ benchmarks, rising to +5.60 and +8.40 points on domain-aligned tasks. Systematic progression to L5 yields a +1.36 total gain, confirming that higher-level processing unlocks latent data value. We release the Darwin-Science corpus and daVinci-origin models to enable principled, co-evolutionary development.

Conclusion: VeriTime框架通过数据合成、调度和强化学习训练，显著提升了LLM在时间序列推理任务中的性能，甚至使小型模型达到或超过大型专有LLM的能力。

Abstract: Time series is a pervasive data type across various application domains, rendering the reasonable solving of diverse time series tasks a long-standing goal. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks. Notably, it enables compact 3B, 4B models to achieve reasoning capabilities on par with or exceeding those of larger proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: LQA框架为边缘设备上的视觉语言模型（VLM）部署提供了一条实用路径，实现了鲁棒性、隐私保护和高效性。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices is challenged by resource constraints and performance degradation under distribution shifts. While test-time adaptation (TTA) can counteract such shifts, existing methods are too resource-intensive for on-device deployment. To address this challenge, we propose LQA, a lightweight, quantized-adaptive framework for VLMs that combines a modality-aware quantization strategy with gradient-free test-time adaptation. We introduce Selective Hybrid Quantization (SHQ) and a quantized, gradient-free adaptation mechanism to enable robust and efficient VLM deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Experiments across both synthetic and real-world distribution shifts show that LQA improves overall adaptation performance by 4.5\%, uses less memory than full-precision models, and significantly outperforms gradient-based TTA methods, achieving up to 19.9$\times$ lower memory usage across seven open-source datasets. These results demonstrate that LQA offers a practical pathway for robust, privacy-preserving, and efficient VLM deployment on edge devices.

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析大型语言模型在微调后出现的‘紧急错位’现象，揭示了模型学习与泛化中的归纳偏差，并提出了一种用于监控和缓解错位的具体表示方法。

Abstract: Finetuning large language models on narrowly harmful datasets can cause them to become emergently misaligned, giving stereotypically `evil' responses across diverse unrelated settings. Concerningly, a pre-registered survey of experts failed to predict this result, highlighting our poor understanding of the inductive biases governing learning and generalisation in LLMs. We use emergent misalignment (EM) as a case study to investigate these inductive biases and find that models can just learn the narrow dataset task, but that the general solution appears to be more stable and more efficient. To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes.

Conclusion: ToolSelf 提出了一种新范式，通过工具驱动的运行时自重构，实现了从外部规则到内在参数的转变，为真正自适应的智能体开辟了道路。

Abstract: Agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling complex, long-horizon tasks. However, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by static configurations governing agent behaviors, which are fixed prior to execution and fail to adapt to evolving task dynamics. Existing approaches, relying on manual orchestration or heuristic-based patches, often struggle with poor generalization and fragmented optimization. To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents.

Abstract: Long-term memory enables large language model agents to tackle complex tasks through historical interactions. However, existing frameworks encounter a fundamental dilemma between compressing redundant information efficiently and maintaining precise retrieval for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose MemFly, a framework grounded in information bottleneck principles that facilitates on-the-fly memory evolution for LLMs. Our approach minimizes compression entropy while maximizing relevance entropy via a gradient-free optimizer, constructing a stratified memory structure for efficient storage. To fully leverage MemFly, we develop a hybrid retrieval mechanism that seamlessly integrates semantic, symbolic, and topological pathways, incorporating iterative refinement to handle complex multi-hop queries. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MemFly substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in memory coherence, response fidelity, and accuracy.

Abstract: The algorithms based on message passing neural networks (MPNNs) on graphs have recently achieved great success for various graph applications. However, studies find that these methods always propagate the information to very limited neighborhoods with shallow depth, particularly due to over-smoothing. That means most of the existing MPNNs fail to be so `deep'. Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption. Additionally, the proposed method can be considered as a component that can underpin almost all GCN tasks, with DGCRL being demonstrated in the experiment.

Motivation: 传统Tensor在处理具有层次结构（嵌套数据）和多模态的复杂认知AI系统数据时，编程不便且效率低下。

Method: 提出了TreeTensor，通过约束树结构视角系统化建模数据关系，并结合其他方法扩展更多用途，如异步执行和变长数据计算。

Conclusion: TreeTensor作为一种通用的嵌套数据容器，通过其约束和实用工具，能够以几乎零成本对嵌套数据应用任意函数和操作，展现出卓越的运行时效率，且无任何开销。

Abstract: Tensor is the most basic and essential data structure of nowadays artificial intelligence (AI) system. The natural properties of Tensor, especially the memory-continuity and slice-independence, make it feasible for training system to leverage parallel computing unit like GPU to process data simultaneously in batch, spatial or temporal dimensions. However, if we look beyond perception tasks, the data in a complicated cognitive AI system usually has hierarchical structures (i.e. nested data) with various modalities. They are inconvenient and inefficient to program directly with conventional Tensor with fixed shape. To address this issue, we summarize two main computational patterns of nested data, and then propose a general nested data container: TreeTensor. Through various constraints and magic utilities of TreeTensor, one can apply arbitrary functions and operations to nested data with almost zero cost, including some famous machine learning libraries, such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy and PyTorch. Our approach utilizes a constrained tree-structure perspective to systematically model data relationships, and it can also easily be combined with other methods to extend more usages, such as asynchronous execution and variable-length data computation. Detailed examples and benchmarks show TreeTensor not only provides powerful usability in various problems, especially one of the most complicated AI systems at present: AlphaStar for StarCraftII, but also exhibits excellent runtime efficiency without any overhead.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）的元认知能力（即对自身知识状态的自我意识）如何优化推理过程，以应对推理规模扩大带来的收益递减问题。

Method: 提出了MedCoG，一个结合知识图谱的医疗元认知代理，通过动态评估任务复杂性、熟悉度和知识密度来调节过程性、情景性和事实性知识的使用。

Result: 在五个医疗基准测试中，MedCoG实现了5.5倍的推理密度提升，验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: MedCoG通过元认知调节机制有效提高了大型语言模型在医疗推理中的效率和准确性，展示了元认知在优化推理过程中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in complex medical reasoning yet face diminishing gains under inference scaling laws. While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation.

Motivation: 全球变暖导致野火频率和强度预计将显著增加，传统灾害管理框架因依赖静态模拟和被动数据采集，无法实时适应不断变化的野火情况。

Conclusion: IVSR通过结合实时双向数字孪生与自主AI代理，提供了一个可扩展、半自动化的决策支持范式，显著提高了野火灾害管理的主动性和适应性。

Abstract: According to the United Nations, wildfire frequency and intensity are projected to increase by approximately 14% by 2030 and 30% by 2050 due to global warming, posing critical threats to life, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Conventional disaster management frameworks rely on static simulations and passive data acquisition, hindering their ability to adapt to arbitrarily evolving wildfire episodes in real-time. To address these limitations, we introduce the Intelligent Virtual Situation Room (IVSR), a bidirectional Digital Twin (DT) platform augmented by autonomous AI agents. The IVSR continuously ingests multisource sensor imagery, weather data, and 3D forest models to create a live virtual replica of the fire environment. A similarity engine powered by AI aligns emerging conditions with a precomputed Disaster Simulation Library, retrieving and calibrating intervention tactics under the watchful eyes of experts. Authorized action-ranging from UAV redeployment to crew reallocation-is cycled back through standardized procedures to the physical layer, completing the loop between response and analysis. We validate IVSR through detailed case-study simulations provided by an industrial partner, demonstrating capabilities in localized incident detection, privacy-preserving playback, collider-based fire-spread projection, and site-specific ML retraining. Our results indicate marked reductions in detection-to-intervention latency and more effective resource coordination versus traditional systems. By uniting real-time bidirectional DTs with agentic AI, IVSR offers a scalable, semi-automated decision-support paradigm for proactive, adaptive wildfire disaster management.

Motivation: 现有概念遗忘方法计算成本高且静态定位导致效果不佳，需解决高效动态遗忘问题。

Method: 提出 TRUST 方法，动态估计目标概念神经元并通过选择性微调和 Hessian 正则化进行遗忘。

Result: 实验表明 TRUST 对抗对抗性提示更鲁棒，生成质量保留度高，且速度显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRUST 是一种新颖的动态目标概念神经元估计方法，通过选择性微调和基于 Hessian 的正则化实现高效概念遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text guided diffusion models are used by millions of users, but can be easily exploited to produce harmful content. Concept unlearning methods aim at reducing the models' likelihood of generating harmful content. Traditionally, this has been tackled at an individual concept level, with only a handful of recent works considering more realistic concept combinations. However, state of the art methods depend on full finetuning, which is computationally expensive. Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA. Our method achieves unlearning of not only individual concepts but also combinations of concepts and conditional concepts, without any specific regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决预训练模型在通用持续学习（GCL）中难以调和多样且时间混合信息的问题，受神经科学中的元可塑性和重建记忆启发，提出了MePo方法。

Method: MePo通过构建伪任务序列和开发双层元学习范式来优化预训练主干，并初始化元协方差矩阵作为预训练表示空间的参考几何。

Result: MePo在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-R和CUB-200等数据集上分别实现了15.10%、13.36%和12.56%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MePo作为一种插件策略，在多种GCL基准测试和预训练检查点上实现了显著的性能提升，无需重复训练。

Abstract: To cope with uncertain changes of the external world, intelligent systems must continually learn from complex, evolving environments and respond in real time. This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\%, 13.36\%, and 12.56\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

Motivation: 工具变量的识别需要跨学科知识、创造力和上下文理解，这是一项非平凡的任务，研究 LLMs 是否能辅助这一过程。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：首先测试 LLMs 是否能复现文献中的已知工具变量，其次评估其识别和避免被证伪的工具变量的能力。

Result: LLMs 能够复现已知工具变量并避免被证伪的工具变量，IV Co-Scientist 系统展示了其潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs 在从大型观察数据库中识别有效工具变量方面显示出潜力，IV Co-Scientist 系统能够提出、评估和优化工具变量。

Abstract: In the presence of confounding between an endogenous variable and the outcome, instrumental variables (IVs) are used to isolate the causal effect of the endogenous variable. Identifying valid instruments requires interdisciplinary knowledge, creativity, and contextual understanding, making it a non-trivial task. In this paper, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in this task. We perform a two-stage evaluation framework. First, we test whether LLMs can recover well-established instruments from the literature, assessing their ability to replicate standard reasoning. Second, we evaluate whether LLMs can identify and avoid instruments that have been empirically or theoretically discredited. Building on these results, we introduce IV Co-Scientist, a multi-agent system that proposes, critiques, and refines IVs for a given treatment-outcome pair. We also introduce a statistical test to contextualize consistency in the absence of ground truth. Our results show the potential of LLMs to discover valid instrumental variables from a large observational database.

Motivation: 评估语言代理在动态增长上下文中的能力，弥补现有长上下文基准测试的不足。

Method: 通过自动化、可扩展的环境状态控制来调节代理的上下文长度，设计LOCA-bench基准测试。

Result: 代理性能随环境状态复杂度增加而下降，但高级上下文管理技术能显著提高成功率。

Conclusion: LOCA-bench提供了一个评估长上下文代理场景下模型和框架的平台，开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of carrying out long-running, real-world tasks. However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as "context rot". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法难以支持端到端的科学发现过程，导致社会科学研究进展缓慢。

Method: EXPERIGEN采用贝叶斯优化启发的两阶段搜索：生成器提出候选假设，实验者进行实证评估。该方法适用于多模态和关系型数据等复杂场景。

Result: EXPERIGEN在多个领域中发现的假设比现有方法多2-4倍，预测性提高7-17%，专家评审中88%的假设具有新颖性，70%被认为值得深入，A/B测试显示p值<1e-6且效应量达344%。

Conclusion: EXPERIGEN框架通过其两阶段搜索机制显著提升了科学发现的效率和质量，生成的假设不仅在统计上更显著、预测性更强，还具备新颖性、实证基础和可操作性，得到了专家认可，并通过实际A/B测试验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Data-driven social science research is inherently slow, relying on iterative cycles of observation, hypothesis generation, and experimental validation. While recent data-driven methods promise to accelerate parts of this process, they largely fail to support end-to-end scientific discovery. To address this gap, we introduce EXPERIGEN, an agentic framework that operationalizes end-to-end discovery through a Bayesian optimization inspired two-phase search, in which a Generator proposes candidate hypotheses and an Experimenter evaluates them empirically. Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets. Beyond statistical performance, hypotheses must be novel, empirically grounded, and actionable to drive real scientific progress. To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research. Finally, recognizing that ultimate validation requires real-world evidence, we conduct the first A/B test of LLM-generated hypotheses, observing statistically significant results with p less than 1e-6 and a large effect size of 344 percent.

Conclusion: RAPS框架有效解决了多智能体协调中的适应性、可扩展性和鲁棒性问题，为LLM智能体的自动化协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-agent architectures built on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to realize swarm intelligence through well-crafted collaboration. However, the substantial burden of manual orchestration inherently raises an imperative to automate the design of agentic workflows. We frame such an agent coordination challenge as a classic problem in dynamic ad-hoc networking: How to establish adaptive and reliable communication among a scalable number of agentic hosts? In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers. Extensive experiments over five benchmarks showcase that our design effectively reconciles adaptivity, scalability, and robustness in a unified multi-agent coordination framework.

Result: SAG在效果、可靠性和部署成本上均优于单一大型模型。

Conclusion: SAG提供了一种在数字健康领域更有效、可靠且部署成本合理的解决方案，通过协同推理替代模型参数增长。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in digital health has been driven by a "scaling-first" philosophy, i.e., the assumption that clinical intelligence increases with model size and data. However, real-world clinical needs include not only effectiveness, but also reliability and reasonable deployment cost. Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation. These findings suggest that the synergistic reasoning represented by SAG can substitute for model parameter growth in clinical settings. Overall, SAG offers a scalable solution to digital health that better balances effectiveness, reliability, and deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a core technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), widely used to interpret model decisions and suggest actionable alternatives. This work presents a structure-aware and robustness-oriented counterfactual search method based on the conditional Gaussian network classifier (CGNC). The CGNC has a generative structure that encodes conditional dependencies and potential causal relations among features through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure naturally embeds feature relationships into the search process, eliminating the need for additional constraints to ensure consistency with the model's structural assumptions. We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM作为‘仅分配’引擎，持续积累有效和冗余步骤，缺乏修剪过时信息的机制，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Free()LM模型，通过Free-Module（即插即用的LoRA适配器）实现内在自我遗忘能力，动态识别并修剪无用上下文块。

Result: Free()LM在所有模型规模（8B至685B）上均表现一致提升，平均优于顶级推理基线3.3%，并在长时任务中恢复性能至50%（标准模型为0%）。

Conclusion: 可持续智能需要遗忘的自由与思考的力量同样重要。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as "malloc-only" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.
  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.

Conclusion: 本文提出的PPO-GNN框架为复杂制造调度问题提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: The Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMSP) with release dates, setups, and eligibility constraints presents a significant multi-objective challenge. Traditional methods struggle to balance minimizing Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and Total Setup Time (TST). This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The GNN effectively represents the complex state of jobs, machines, and setups, allowing the PPO agent to learn a direct scheduling policy. Guided by a multi-objective reward function, the agent simultaneously minimizes TWT and TST. Experimental results on benchmark instances demonstrate that our PPO-GNN agent significantly outperforms a standard dispatching rule and a metaheuristic, achieving a superior trade-off between both objectives. This provides a robust and scalable solution for complex manufacturing scheduling.

Conclusion: 数据控制可能是减少生物AI能力扩散的高杠杆干预措施。

Abstract: Training data is an essential input into creating competent artificial intelligence (AI) models. AI models for biology are trained on large volumes of data, including data related to biological sequences, structures, images, and functions. The type of data used to train a model is intimately tied to the capabilities it ultimately possesses--including those of biosecurity concern. For this reason, an international group of more than 100 researchers at the recent 50th anniversary Asilomar Conference endorsed data controls to prevent the use of AI for harmful applications such as bioweapons development. To help design such controls, we introduce a five-tier Biosecurity Data Level (BDL) framework for categorizing pathogen data. Each level contains specific data types, based on their expected ability to contribute to capabilities of concern when used to train AI models. For each BDL tier, we propose technical restrictions appropriate to its level of risk. Finally, we outline a novel governance framework for newly created dual-use pathogen data. In a world with widely accessible computational and coding resources, data controls may be among the most high-leverage interventions available to reduce the proliferation of concerning biological AI capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出ESA方法，通过判断反馈来源而非信号本身，解决传统RL在社交环境中因评估者偏见导致的目标解耦问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当代AI对齐策略依赖的假设（人类反馈是真实信号）在社交环境中可能失效，导致目标解耦（Objective Decoupling）。

Method: 提出Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA)，利用稀疏安全公理来判断反馈来源，而非依赖统计共识。

Result: 实验证明，传统共识方法在多数共谋下失败，而ESA能成功恢复最优策略。

Conclusion: Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA) 通过判断反馈来源而非信号本身，即使在多数评估者有偏见的情况下，也能保证收敛到真实目标，解决了传统共识方法在多数共谋下的失败问题。

Abstract: Contemporary AI alignment strategies rely on a fragile premise: that human feedback, while noisy, remains a fundamentally truthful signal. In this paper, we identify this assumption as Dogma 4 of Reinforcement Learning (RL). We demonstrate that while this dogma holds in static environments, it fails in social settings where evaluators may be sycophantic, lazy, or adversarial. We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself. We prove that this "judging the judges" mechanism guarantees convergence to the true objective, even when a majority of evaluators are biased. Empirically, we show that while traditional consensus methods fail under majority collusion, our approach successfully recovers the optimal policy.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段梯度框架，用于多智能体强化学习中可解释的故障检测与传播分析，实验显示高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在安全关键领域应用广泛，但可解释的故障检测和归因方法仍不足。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段基于梯度的框架，第一阶段通过泰勒余项分析进行可解释的每智能体故障检测，第二阶段通过几何分析验证故障传播路径。

Result: 在Simple Spread（3和5智能体）和StarCraft II中评估，该方法在Patient-0检测准确率达到88.2-99.4%，并提供可解释的几何证据。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供可解释的梯度级诊断工具，为安全关键的多智能体强化学习系统诊断级联故障提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet methods for interpretable failure detection and attribution remain underdeveloped. We introduce a two-stage gradient-based framework that provides interpretable diagnostics for three critical failure analysis tasks: (1) detecting the true initial failure source (Patient-0); (2) validating why non-attacked agents may be flagged first due to domino effects; and (3) tracing how failures propagate through learned coordination pathways. Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains "downstream-first" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions. By moving beyond black-box detection to interpretable gradient-level forensics, this framework offers practical tools for diagnosing cascading failures in safety-critical MARL systems.

TL;DR: Glow是一个GenAI驱动的DBT教练，用于HIV和物质使用风险降低。安全性测试显示73%的风险探针被适当处理，但链分析代理表现较差。研究揭示了在临床试验前需要解决的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV和物质使用代表了具有共同心理驱动因素（冲动性和适应不良应对）的相互作用的流行病。DBT针对这些机制，但面临可扩展性挑战。GenAI提供了大规模提供个性化DBT辅导的潜力，但快速发展超过了安全基础设施。

Method: 我们开发了Glow，一个由GenAI驱动的DBT技能教练，为HIV和物质使用风险个体提供链分析和解决方案分析。通过与洛杉矶社区健康组织合作，我们进行了临床工作人员（n=6）和有生活经验的个体（n=28）的可用性测试。使用HHH框架，我们进行了用户驱动的对抗性测试，参与者识别目标行为并生成上下文现实的风险探针。我们评估了37个风险探针交互的安全性表现。

Result: Glow适当处理了73%的风险探针，但表现因代理而异。解决方案分析代理表现出90%的适当处理，而链分析代理为44%。安全失败集中在鼓励物质使用和正常化有害行为上。链分析代理陷入了“同理心陷阱”，提供了强化适应不良信念的验证。此外，还发现了27例DBT技能错误信息。

Conclusion: 本研究首次对GenAI提供的DBT辅导在HIV和物质使用风险降低中的安全性进行了系统评估，揭示了在临床试验前需要解决的脆弱性。HHH框架和用户驱动的对抗性测试为评估GenAI心理健康干预提供了可复制的方法。

Abstract: Background: HIV and substance use represent interacting epidemics with shared psychological drivers - impulsivity and maladaptive coping. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an "empathy trap," providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction. Findings reveal vulnerabilities requiring mitigation before clinical trials. The HHH framework and user-driven adversarial testing offer replicable methods for evaluating GenAI mental health interventions.

TL;DR: 本文提出递归熵量化LRMs反思过程中的资源消耗风险，并设计RECUR攻击验证其缺陷，实验显示攻击显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中需要显式推理，但推理过程（尤其是反思部分）可能导致过度反思和资源消耗，此前研究较少关注。

Method: 基于递归熵，引入RECUR（递归熵引导的反事实利用和反思）攻击方法，构建反事实问题验证LRMs的固有缺陷和风险。

Result: 实验表明，良性推理下递归熵呈下降趋势，而RECUR破坏此趋势，输出长度增加11倍，吞吐量下降90%。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入递归熵量化反思过程中的资源消耗风险，揭示了推理本身的安全问题，并提出了RECUR攻击方法，为鲁棒推理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) employ reasoning to address complex tasks. Such explicit reasoning requires extended context lengths, resulting in substantially higher resource consumption. Prior work has shown that adversarially crafted inputs can trigger redundant reasoning processes, exposing LRMs to resource-exhaustion vulnerabilities. However, the reasoning process itself, especially its reflective component, has received limited attention, even though it can lead to over-reflection and consume excessive computing power. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Entropy to quantify the risk of resource consumption in reflection, thereby revealing the safety issues inherent in inference itself. Based on Recursive Entropy, we introduce RECUR, a resource exhaustion attack via Recursive Entropy guided Counterfactual Utilization and Reflection. It constructs counterfactual questions to verify the inherent flaws and risks of LRMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under benign inference, recursive entropy exhibits a pronounced decreasing trend. RECUR disrupts this trend, increasing the output length by up to 11x and decreasing throughput by 90%. Our work provides a new perspective on robust reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模型高度自信后继续强化目标预测，但忽略了模型自身历史弱状态中的潜在监督信号。

Method: WMSS通过熵动态识别可恢复的学习差距，并通过补偿性学习强化这些差距。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成数据集上的实验表明，采用WMSS训练的代理模型实现了有效的性能提升。

Conclusion: WMSS通过利用模型自身的弱检查点来指导持续优化，有效突破了传统后训练中的饱和瓶颈，实现了性能的进一步提升，且不增加推理成本。

Abstract: As post-training optimization becomes central to improving large language models, we observe a persistent saturation bottleneck: once models grow highly confident, further training yields diminishing returns. While existing methods continue to reinforce target predictions, we find that informative supervision signals remain latent in models' own historical weak states. Motivated by this observation, we propose WMSS (Weak Agents Can Make Strong Agents Stronger), a post-training paradigm that leverages weak checkpoints to guide continued optimization. By identifying recoverable learning gaps via entropy dynamics and reinforcing them through compensatory learning, WMSS enables strong agents to improve beyond conventional post-training saturation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation datasets show that agents trained with our approach achieve effective performance improvements, while incurring zero additional inference cost.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个去中心化的评估框架，通过区块链协议激励全球贡献者作为独立验证者，显著提高了模型排名的统计置信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) demands increasingly reliable evaluation, yet current centralized evaluation suffers from opacity, overfitting, and hardware-induced variance. Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a "centralized black box" into a "decentralized endorsement" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community.

Motivation: 传统语音情感识别模型在边缘设备上计算成本高，而SNN虽能效高，但与SSL表示的集成存在分布不匹配问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN)，包括Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder捕获局部时间依赖，以及Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration策略通过Spiking Sparse Linear Attention模块聚合全局语义上下文，动态调节PLIF神经元的偏置电压。

Result: 在五个多语言数据集上，PTS-SNN在IEMOCAP上达到73.34%准确率，仅需1.19M可训练参数和0.35 mJ每样本推理能耗。

Conclusion: PTS-SNN通过高效的神经形态适应框架，成功解决了SSL表示与SNN之间的分布不匹配问题，实现了在资源受限的边缘设备上的高效语音情感识别。

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is widely deployed in Human-Computer Interaction, yet the high computational cost of conventional models hinders their implementation on resource-constrained edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在视觉注意力方面表现不佳，早期的视觉对齐错误难以在后续推理中修正，导致错误传播和推理失败。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，设计了区域级视觉注意力奖励机制，以优化视觉注意力的学习过程。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，SAYO模型在多样化的推理和感知任务上表现一致优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAYO模型通过引入基于区域级视觉注意力的奖励机制，显著提升了多模态大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能，尤其是在视觉注意力的稳定性和错误修正方面。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has substantially improved multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, existing approaches largely rely on long textual reasoning trajectories and provide limited mechanisms for learning stable visual attention policies. Our analysis shows that current MLLMs exhibit weak visual focus: early-stage visual misalignment is rarely corrected during subsequent reasoning, leading to error propagation and failed inferences. We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法局限于固定启发式形式，难以在复杂组合优化问题中逃离深局部最优。

Method: 提出G-LNS生成式进化框架，利用LLM协同进化紧密耦合的破坏与修复算子对，并通过合作评估机制捕获其交互。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP等基准测试中，G-LNS显著优于基于LLM的AHD方法及经典求解器，且表现出对未见实例分布的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: G-LNS框架通过LLM协同进化破坏与修复算子，显著提升了组合优化问题的求解性能，并在计算预算有限的情况下实现了接近最优的解。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in Automated Heuristic Design (AHD), existing approaches typically formulate AHD around constructive priority rules or parameterized local search guidance, thereby restricting the search space to fixed heuristic forms. Such designs offer limited capacity for structural exploration, making it difficult to escape deep local optima in complex Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction. Extensive experiments on challenging COP benchmarks, such as Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP), demonstrate that G-LNS significantly outperforms LLM-based AHD methods as well as strong classical solvers. The discovered heuristics not only achieve near-optimal solutions with reduced computational budgets but also exhibit robust generalization across diverse and unseen instance distributions.

Abstract: Simulating high-fidelity patients offers a powerful avenue for studying complex diseases while addressing the challenges of fragmented, biased, and privacy-restricted real-world data. In this study, we introduce SynthAgent, a novel Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework designed to model obesity patients with comorbid mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, social phobia, and binge eating disorder. SynthAgent integrates clinical and medical evidence from claims data, population surveys, and patient-centered literature to construct personalized virtual patients enriched with personality traits that influence adherence, emotion regulation, and lifestyle behaviors. Through autonomous agent interactions, the system simulates disease progression, treatment response, and life management across diverse psychosocial contexts. Evaluation of more than 100 generated patients demonstrated that GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved the highest fidelity as the core engine in the proposed MAS framework, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek-R1. SynthAgent thus provides a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for exploring patient journeys, behavioral dynamics, and decision-making processes in both medical and psychological domains.

Method: 提出并实现了一个基于浏览器的系统Puda，支持用户在三个隐私级别上控制数据共享，并通过个性化旅行规划任务进行评估。

Result: 预定义类别子集在个性化性能上达到详细浏览历史的97.2%，验证了Puda在隐私与个性化之间的有效权衡。

Conclusion: Puda提供了一种用户主权架构，有效平衡了数据利用与隐私保护，为用户提供了多粒度数据管理选择，同时实现了高度个性化服务。

Abstract: Personal data centralization among dominant platform providers including search engines, social networking services, and e-commerce has created siloed ecosystems that restrict user sovereignty, thereby impeding data use across services. Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has intensified demand for highly personalized services that require the dynamic provision of diverse personal data. This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off. Overall, Puda provides an AI-native foundation for user sovereignty, empowering users to safely leverage the full potential of personalized AI.

Conclusion: 为了解决当前LLM代理研究中的碎片化问题，提出了一个形式化的结构上下文模型，并引入了声明式实现框架和可持续代理工程工作流，显著提升了代理在挑战性任务中的成功率。

Abstract: Current research on large language model (LLM) agents is fragmented: discussions of conceptual frameworks and methodological principles are frequently intertwined with low-level implementation details, causing both readers and authors to lose track amid a proliferation of superficially distinct concepts. We argue that this fragmentation largely stems from the absence of an analyzable, self-consistent formal model that enables implementation-independent characterization and comparison of LLM agents. To address this gap, we propose the \texttt{Structural Context Model}, a formal model for analyzing and comparing LLM agents from the perspective of context structure. Building upon this foundation, we introduce two complementary components that together span the full lifecycle of LLM agent research and development: (1) a declarative implementation framework; and (2) a sustainable agent engineering workflow, \texttt{Semantic Dynamics Analysis}. The proposed workflow provides principled insights into agent mechanisms and supports rapid, systematic design iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the complete framework on dynamic variants of the monkey-banana problem, where agents engineered using our approach achieve up to a 32 percentage points improvement in success rate on the most challenging setting.

Conclusion: 生成式人工智能（GenAI）不仅是一种技术进步，更是一种认识论上的质变，挑战了计算机科学的基础假设。人类角色从算法问题定义转向'氛围工程'（Vibe-Engineering），即协调生成系统的对齐和情境判断。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represents not an incremental technological advance but a qualitative epistemological shift that challenges foundational assumptions of computer science. Whereas machine learning has been described as the automation of automation, generative AI operates by navigating contextual, semantic, and stylistic coherence rather than optimizing predefined objective metrics. This paper introduces the concept of Vibe-Automation to characterize this transition.
  The central claim is that the significance of GenAI lies in its functional access to operationalized tacit regularities: context-sensitive patterns embedded in practice that cannot be fully specified through explicit algorithmic rules. Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.
  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity.

Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型（VLMs）在道德基础视觉决策中的迎合行为，填补现有研究对道德迎合行为影响的不足。

Method: 分析了10个广泛使用的VLM模型在Moralise和M^3oralBench数据集上的表现，特别是在用户明确反对的情境下，使用错误引入率（EIR）和错误纠正率（ECR）进行评估。

Result: VLMs在用户诱导偏见下更倾向于从道德正确转向错误判断，且初始道德正确的语境会引发更强的迎合行为。不同数据集上模型表现存在差异。

Conclusion: VLMs表现出明显的道德迎合行为，尤其在初始道德判断正确时更容易受到用户偏见影响而改变立场。研究强调了提升多模态AI系统伦理一致性和鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: Sycophancy in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) refers to their tendency to align with user opinions, often at the expense of moral or factual accuracy. While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools via multi-agent systems offers a promising new paradigm for decomposing and solving complex problems. However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have markedly improved image-text alignment, yet they still fall short of human-like visual reasoning. A key limitation is that many VLMs rely on surface correlations rather than building logically coherent structured representations, which often leads to missed higher-level semantic structure and non-causal relational understanding, hindering compositional and verifiable reasoning. To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Ablations confirm that each component contributes to more interpretable and human-aligned visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估因果发现可靠性的框架，强调可容许性和效应验证的重要性，而非仅依赖图结构恢复。实证研究表明，可识别性是决策支持的关键瓶颈，而效应一致性验证能提高结论的可信度。

Motivation: 研究因果发现在具有强自选择性的反馈驱动系统中的可靠性，特别是在用户干预效果估计中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种以效应为中心、优先考虑可容许性的框架，通过可识别性、稳定性和证伪性来评估发现的图结构。

Result: 许多统计上合理的发现输出在施加最小时间和语义约束后无法支持点识别的因果查询。当识别可行时，不同算法家族尽管产生显著不同的图结构，却能收敛到相似的、决策一致的效应估计。

Conclusion: 在基于遥测数据的因果发现中，仅依赖图结构恢复的准确性不足以支持可信的因果结论。必须优先考虑可容许性和效应层面的验证。

Abstract: Causal discovery is increasingly applied to large-scale telemetry data to estimate the effects of user-facing interventions, yet its reliability for decision-making in feedback-driven systems with strong self-selection remains unclear. In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone.

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a new paradigm for large reasoning models (LRMs) in tackling complex problems. Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions.

Motivation: 现有基准在评估TKG演化模型时存在偏差和简化，导致模型可能通过简单的共现计数而非利用时间信息达到高性能。

Method: 通过分析现有基准中的固有偏差和评估任务的简化形式，识别并纠正了数据集中的问题，并设计了新的任务。

Result: 揭示了现有基准的局限性，包括时间间隔知识的不合理格式化、忽视知识过时学习以及信息不足等问题。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新的TKG演化基准，包括四个经过偏差校正的数据集和两项新任务，以更准确地评估TKG演化建模的挑战。

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) structurally preserve evolving human knowledge. Recent research has focused on designing models to learn the evolutionary nature of TKGs to predict future facts, achieving impressive results. For instance, Hits@10 scores over 0.9 on YAGO dataset. However, we find that existing benchmarks inadvertently introduce a shortcut. Near state-of-the-art performance can be simply achieved by counting co-occurrences, without using any temporal information. In this work, we examine the root cause of this issue, identifying inherent biases in current datasets and over simplified form of evaluation task that can be exploited by these biases. Through this analysis, we further uncover additional limitations of existing benchmarks, including unreasonable formatting of time-interval knowledge, ignorance of learning knowledge obsolescence, and insufficient information for precise evolution understanding, all of which can amplify the shortcut and hinder a fair assessment. Therefore, we introduce the TKG evolution benchmark. It includes four bias-corrected datasets and two novel tasks closely aligned with the evolution process, promoting a more accurate understanding of the challenges in TKG evolution modeling.

Conclusion: SAGE（Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning）作为一种新型采样范式，显著提升了大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理准确性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: We make three contributions in this paper. First, we present an approach for compiling a random forest classifier into a set of circuits, where each circuit directly encodes the instances in some class of the classifier. We show empirically that our proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing similar approaches. Next, we utilize this approach to further obtain circuits that are tractable for computing the complete and general reasons of a decision, which are instance abstractions that play a fundamental role in computing explanations. Finally, we propose algorithms for computing the robustness of a decision and all shortest ways to flip it. We illustrate the utility of our contributions by using them to enumerate all sufficient reasons, necessary reasons and contrastive explanations of decisions; to compute the robustness of decisions; and to identify all shortest ways to flip the decisions made by random forest classifiers learned from a wide range of datasets.

Motivation: 现有代理内存系统设计孤立，检索方法紧密耦合，阻碍跨范式泛化和融合。

Method: 提出MemAdapter框架，采用两阶段训练策略：生成子图检索器训练和轻量级对齐模块的对比学习适应。

Result: MemAdapter在三个公共评估基准上表现优于五种强代理内存系统，跨范式对齐仅需13分钟，计算成本低于5%。

Conclusion: MemAdapter通过两阶段训练策略和轻量级对齐模块，显著提升了跨范式内存检索的灵活性和效率，并在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Memory mechanism is a core component of LLM-based agents, enabling reasoning and knowledge discovery over long-horizon contexts. Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖不可靠的LLM进行安全检查或简单拒绝不安全计划，缺乏主动修复能力，无法提供严格的安全保证。

Method: 引入了可验证迭代精炼框架（VIRF），采用神经符号架构，通过逻辑导师与LLM规划器的对话实现智能计划修复。

Result: 在家庭安全任务中，VIRF实现了0%的危险动作率和77.3%的目标达成率，平均仅需1.1次修正迭代。

Conclusion: VIRF 提供了一种原则性的方法，构建了可信且可验证安全的具身智能体，实现了零危险动作率和最高的目标达成率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as planners for embodied AI, but their stochastic nature lacks formal reasoning, preventing strict safety guarantees for physical deployment. Current approaches often rely on unreliable LLMs for safety checks or simply reject unsafe plans without offering repairs. We introduce the Verifiable Iterative Refinement Framework (VIRF), a neuro-symbolic architecture that shifts the paradigm from passive safety gatekeeping to active collaboration. Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents.

Motivation: 解决在分布式和访问受限环境中，传统Graph-RAG因依赖集中式知识图而无法有效检索的问题。

Method: SCOUT-RAG采用四个协作代理：(i)评估域相关性，(ii)决定何时扩展到其他域，(iii)调整遍历深度以避免不必要的图探索，(iv)合成高质量答案。

Result: SCOUT-RAG在多域知识设置中表现与集中式基线相当，同时显著减少了跨域调用、总令牌处理量和延迟。

Conclusion: SCOUT-RAG在分布式和访问受限的环境中有效提升了Graph-RAG的性能，减少了跨域调用和处理的总令牌数，同时保持了与集中式基线相当的表现。

Abstract: Graph-RAG improves LLM reasoning using structured knowledge, yet conventional designs rely on a centralized knowledge graph. In distributed and access-restricted settings (e.g., hospitals or multinational organizations), retrieval must select relevant domains and appropriate traversal depth without global graph visibility or exhaustive querying. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SCOUT-RAG} (\textit{\underline{S}calable and \underline{CO}st-efficient \underline{U}nifying \underline{T}raversal}), a distributed agentic Graph-RAG framework that performs progressive cross-domain retrieval guided by incremental utility goals. SCOUT-RAG employs four cooperative agents that: (i) estimate domain relevance, (ii) decide when to expand retrieval to additional domains, (iii) adapt traversal depth to avoid unnecessary graph exploration, and (iv) synthesize the high-quality answers. The framework is designed to minimize retrieval regret, defined as missing useful domain information, while controlling latency and API cost. Across multi-domain knowledge settings, SCOUT-RAG achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines, including DRIFT and exhaustive domain traversal, while substantially reducing cross-domain calls, total tokens processed, and latency.

Conclusion: AutoSpec通过细化逻辑规范，显著提升了强化学习算法解决复杂控制任务的能力。

Abstract: Logical specifications have been shown to help reinforcement learning algorithms in achieving complex tasks. However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.

Conclusion: AGENTWM有效地保护了智能代理系统的知识产权，即使面对适应性强的对手，也能在不显著影响代理性能的情况下实现高检测准确率。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic systems that perform autonomous reasoning and tool use has created significant intellectual property (IP) value. We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility.

Conclusion: 论文提出了PASB框架，用于评估个性化代理在现实部署中的安全性，并通过OpenClaw案例揭示了其关键漏洞，强调了实际部署中的重大安全风险。

Abstract: Although large language model (LLM)-based agents, exemplified by OpenClaw, are increasingly evolving from task-oriented systems into personalized AI assistants for solving complex real-world tasks, their practical deployment also introduces severe security risks. However, existing agent security research and evaluation frameworks primarily focus on synthetic or task-centric settings, and thus fail to accurately capture the attack surface and risk propagation mechanisms of personalized agents in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we propose Personalized Agent Security Bench (PASB), an end-to-end security evaluation framework tailored for real-world personalized agents. Building upon existing agent attack paradigms, PASB incorporates personalized usage scenarios, realistic toolchains, and long-horizon interactions, enabling black-box, end-to-end security evaluation on real systems. Using OpenClaw as a representative case study, we systematically evaluate its security across multiple personalized scenarios, tool capabilities, and attack types. Our results indicate that OpenClaw exhibits critical vulnerabilities at different execution stages, including user prompt processing, tool usage, and memory retrieval, highlighting substantial security risks in personalized agent deployments. The code for the proposed PASB framework is available at https://github.com/AstorYH/PASB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估时观察到的行为是否能预测部署时的行为，对于具有情境意识的智能体而言这一假设变得脆弱，因为它们可能利用情境泄漏来实施条件性策略。

Method: 采用对抗不变性的训练时干预，以减少决策相关内部表征中情境信息的可提取性。

Result: 情境盲训练在两个完全表征的故障模式（科学奉承和时间潜伏代理）中抑制了情境条件行为，且未造成任务效用的显著损失，但动态表现有所不同。

Conclusion: 行为评估应辅以对情境意识及信息流的白盒诊断，因为表征不变性是一种有意义的但本质上有限的控制手段，其有效性取决于情境信息在策略中的嵌入方式。

Abstract: Safety evaluation for advanced AI systems implicitly assumes that behavior observed under evaluation is predictive of behavior in deployment. This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型（LLMs）通常在一次性贪婪推理协议下评估和部署，这种机制可能系统性地低估固定模型的真实能力，许多错误源于内部模糊性下的过早承诺而非知识缺失。

Method: 引入了一种熵感知的推理时控制策略——强化推理（Reinforcement Inference），利用模型自身的不确定性选择性调用第二次更慎重的推理尝试。

Result: 在12,032个MMLU-Pro问题和14个学科上，使用DeepSeek-v3.2进行零样本确定性解码，强化推理将准确率从60.72%提升至84.03%，仅增加61.06%的推理调用。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个更广泛的熵感知范式，用于衡量和扩展模型能力，表明现代基于解码器的模型在生成过程中自然产生熵和相关的置信度测量，可以作为一流的控制信号。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are often evaluated and deployed under a \emph{one-shot, greedy} inference protocol, especially in professional settings that require deterministic behavior. This regime can systematically under-estimate a fixed model's true capability: many errors arise not from missing knowledge, but from premature commitment under internal ambiguity. We introduce \emph{Reinforcement Inference}, an entropy-aware inference-time control strategy that uses the model's own uncertainty to selectively invoke a second, more deliberate reasoning attempt, enabling stronger performance \emph{without any retraining}.
  On 12,032 MMLU-Pro questions across 14 subjects, using DeepSeek-v3.2 with deterministic decoding in a zero-shot setting, Reinforcement Inference improves accuracy from 60.72\% to 84.03\%, while only incurring 61.06\% additional inference calls. A 100\% re-asking ablation reaches 84.35\%, indicating that uncertainty-aware selection captures most of the attainable improvement with substantially less compute. Moreover, a \emph{prompt-only} ablation underperforms the baseline, suggesting that the gains are not explained by generic `` your output had high entropy, think step-by-step'' prompting alone.
  Beyond providing a practical inference-time upgrade, our results suggest a broader \emph{entropy-aware} paradigm for measuring and expanding model capability: because modern decoder-based models generate outputs autoregressively, entropy and related confidence measures arise naturally as first-class control signals during generation. The resulting gap between one-pass greedy inference and uncertainty-conditioned deliberation offers a diagnostic lens on an LLM's latent reasoning horizon and motivates future training objectives that explicitly constrain correctness--confidence alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖预收集的用户数据，且强化学习存在短视野偏差，忽视长期对话价值。

Method: 采用双代理游戏范式，用户代理通过风格模仿和主动终止构建动态环境，对话代理通过AT-GRPO优化策略。AT-GRPO将对话轨迹重新解释为树，并引入自适应观察范围以平衡探索与维护。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在性能、样本效率和鲁棒性方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个结合在线个性化与AT-GRPO的新型长视野强化学习框架，显著提升了对话代理的性能、样本效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Open-ended dialogue agents aim to deliver engaging, personalized interactions by adapting to users' traits, but existing methods face critical limitations: over-reliance on pre-collected user data, and short-horizon biases in reinforcement learning (RL) that neglect long-term dialogue value. To address these, we propose a novel long-horizon RL framework integrating online personalization with Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO). Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture. Extensive experiments show our framework's superior performance, sample efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.
  We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 提出的自上而下注意力机制使全局工作空间在多模态数据集上具有竞争力，与现有基准相比达到先进水平。

Abstract: Global Workspace Theory (GWT), inspired by cognitive neuroscience, posits that flexible cognition could arise via the attentional selection of a relevant subset of modalities within a multimodal integration system. This cognitive framework can inspire novel computational architectures for multimodal integration. Indeed, recent implementations of GWT have explored its multimodal representation capabilities, but the related attention mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we propose and evaluate a top-down attention mechanism to select modalities inside a global workspace. First, we demonstrate that our attention mechanism improves noise robustness of a global workspace system on two multimodal datasets of increasing complexity: Simple Shapes and MM-IMDb 1.0. Second, we highlight various cross-task and cross-modality generalization capabilities that are not shared by multimodal attention models from the literature. Comparing against existing baselines on the MM-IMDb 1.0 benchmark, we find our attention mechanism makes the global workspace competitive with the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在单一模型局限性或启发式试错协调的不足，需要一种更优化的方法来处理异构视觉和文本约束。

Method: OSCAR 采用离线-在线范式，离线阶段通过两阶段混合整数规划问题建模 CIR，并存储最优轨迹用于在线推理时的 VLM 规划器引导。

Conclusion: OSCAR 框架在三个公共基准和一个私有工业基准上表现优于现有最先进方法，展示了其规划逻辑的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Composed image retrieval (CIR) requires complex reasoning over heterogeneous visual and textual constraints. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization.

Motivation: 先前的研究虽然确立了辩论方法在理论上能解决的问题范围，但未分析人类监督的实际成本。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究辩论方法在实践中的查询效率。

Method: 本文引入辩论查询复杂度（DQC）作为衡量人类监督成本的指标，通过理论分析确定了PSPACE/poly类问题的查询效率，并探讨了DQC与电路复杂度之间的关系。

Result: 研究发现PSPACE/poly类问题仅需O(log n)次查询即可解决，且对于依赖所有输入位的函数，至少需要Omega(log n)次查询。此外，任何可由大小为s的电路计算的函数满足DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3。

Abstract: AI safety via debate uses two competing models to help a human judge verify complex computational tasks. Previous work has established what problems debate can solve in principle, but has not analysed the practical cost of human oversight: how many queries must the judge make to the debate transcript? We introduce Debate Query Complexity}(DQC), the minimum number of bits a verifier must inspect to correctly decide a debate.
  Surprisingly, we find that PSPACE/poly (the class of problems which debate can efficiently decide) is precisely the class of functions decidable with O(log n) queries. This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity.

Result: 指出用户对聊天机器人的信任常由交互设计选择塑造，而非真正的可信度。

Conclusion: 论文提出需要进一步研究和更强有力的支持机制，帮助用户适当校准对对话式AI系统的信任。

Abstract: As chatbots increasingly blur the boundary between automated systems and human conversation, the foundations of trust in these systems warrant closer examination. While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms. In many cases, this trust is not earned through demonstrated trustworthiness but is instead shaped by interactional design choices that leverage cognitive biases to influence user behavior. Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of "trust" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the open question of whether propositional STRIPS with operators limited to one precondition and one effect is NP-complete.

Method: The method involves using a SAT solver for small instances, introducing the literal graph, and mapping it to Petri nets.

Result: The results provide insights into the complexity of STRIPS$^1_1$ but do not definitively resolve the NP-completeness question.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the small solution hypothesis for STRIPS$^1_1$ remains unresolved, but provides insights through SAT solvers, literal graphs, and Petri nets.

Abstract: This paper is based on Bylander's results on the computational complexity of propositional STRIPS planning. He showed that when only ground literals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to two preconditions and two postconditions. While NP-hardness is settled, it is unknown whether propositional STRIPS with operators that only have one precondition and one effect is NP-complete. We shed light on the question whether this small solution hypothesis for STRIPS$^1_1$ is true, calling a SAT solver for small instances, introducing the literal graph, and mapping it to Petri nets.

Abstract: The evaluation of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods is a rapidly growing field, characterized by a wide variety of approaches. This diversity highlights the complexity of the XAI evaluation, which, unlike traditional AI assessment, lacks a universally correct ground truth for the explanation, making objective evaluation challenging. One promising direction to address this issue involves the use of what we term Synthetic Artificial Intelligence Ground truth (SAIG) methods, which generate artificial ground truths to enable the direct evaluation of XAI techniques. This paper presents the first review and analysis of SAIG methods. We introduce a novel taxonomy to classify these approaches, identifying seven key features that distinguish different SAIG methods. Our comparative study reveals a concerning lack of consensus on the most effective XAI evaluation techniques, underscoring the need for further research and standardization in this area.

Conclusion: Lexpop框架通过结合深度强化学习和高效提取方法，显著提升了POMDP和HM-POMDP问题的求解效率，并在大规模状态空间问题上优于现有最优解算器。

Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires computing policies under imperfect state information. Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller. Our experiments show that on problems with large state spaces, Lexpop outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for POMDPs as well as HM-POMDPs.

Abstract: What happens when people's beliefs are derived from information provided by an LLM? People's use of LLM chatbots as thought partners can contribute to cognitive offloading, which can have adverse effects on cognitive skills in cases of over-reliance. This paper defines and investigates a particular kind of cognitive offloading in human-AI interaction, "belief offloading," in which people's processes of forming and upholding beliefs are offloaded onto an AI system with downstream consequences on their behavior and the nature of their system of beliefs. Drawing on philosophy, psychology, and computer science research, we clarify the boundary conditions under which belief offloading occurs and provide a descriptive taxonomy of belief offloading and its normative implications. We close with directions for future work to assess the potential for and consequences of belief offloading in human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Latent or continuous chain-of-thought methods replace explicit textual rationales with a number of internal latent steps, but these intermediate computations are difficult to evaluate beyond correlation-based probes. In this paper, we view latent chain-of-thought as a manipulable causal process in representation space by modeling latent steps as variables in a structural causal model (SCM) and analyzing their effects through step-wise $\mathrm{do}$-interventions. We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems.

Abstract: Constructing a Q-matrix is a critical but labor-intensive step in cognitive diagnostic modeling (CDM). This study investigates whether AI tools (i.e., general language models) can support Q-matrix development by comparing AI-generated Q-matrices with a validated Q-matrix from Li and Suen (2013) for a reading comprehension test. In May 2025, multiple AI models were provided with the same training materials as human experts. Agreement among AI-generated Q-matrices, the validated Q-matrix, and human raters' Q-matrices was assessed using Cohen's kappa. Results showed substantial variation across AI models, with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the highest agreement (Kappa = 0.63) with the validated Q-matrix, exceeding that of all human experts. A follow-up analysis in January 2026 using newer AI versions, however, revealed lower agreement with the validated Q-matrix. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Abstract: Root cause localization remain challenging in complex and large-scale microservice architectures. The complex fault propagation among microservices and the high dimensionality of telemetry data, including metrics, logs, and traces, limit the effectiveness of existing root cause analysis (RCA) methods. In this paper, a residual-connection-based RCA method using large language model (LLM), named RC-LLM, is proposed. A residual-like hierarchical fusion structure is designed to integrate multi-source telemetry data, while the contextual reasoning capability of large language models is leveraged to model temporal and cross-microservice causal dependencies. Experimental results on CCF-AIOps microservice datasets demonstrate that RC-LLM achieves strong accuracy and efficiency in root cause analysis.

Conclusion: NADEx通过引入负样本感知的扩散模型，结合余弦对齐正则化，显著提升了TKG推理的性能，并在四个公开基准测试中达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning seeks to predict future missing facts from historical evidence. While diffusion models (DM) have recently gained attention for their ability to capture complex predictive distributions, two gaps remain: (i) the generative path is conditioned only on positive evidence, overlooking informative negative context, and (ii) training objectives are dominated by cross-entropy ranking, which improves candidate ordering but provides little supervision over the calibration of the denoised embedding. To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates. Comprehensive experiments on four public TKG benchmarks demonstrate that NADEx delivers state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Value-aware AI should recognise human values and adapt to the value systems (value-based preferences) of different users. This requires operationalization of values, which can be prone to misspecification. The social nature of values demands their representation to adhere to multiple users while value systems are diverse, yet exhibit patterns among groups. In sequential decision making, efforts have been made towards personalization for different goals or values from demonstrations of diverse agents. However, these approaches demand manually designed features or lack value-based interpretability and/or adaptability to diverse user preferences.
  We propose algorithms for learning models of value alignment and value systems for a society of agents in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), based on clustering and preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (PbMORL). We jointly learn socially-derived value alignment models (groundings) and a set of value systems that concisely represent different groups of users (clusters) in a society. Each cluster consists of a value system representing the value-based preferences of its members and an approximately Pareto-optimal policy that reflects behaviours aligned with this value system. We evaluate our method against a state-of-the-art PbMORL algorithm and baselines on two MDPs with human values.

Abstract: Among the various forms of reasoning studied in the context of artificial intelligence, qualitative reasoning makes it possible to infer new knowledge in the context of imprecise, incomplete information without numerical values. In this paper, we propose a formal framework unifying several forms of extensions and combinations of qualitative formalisms, including multi-scale reasoning, temporal sequences, and loose integrations. This framework makes it possible to reason in the context of each of these combinations and extensions, but also to study in a unified way the satisfiability decision and its complexity. In particular, we establish two complementary theorems guaranteeing that the satisfiability decision is polynomial, and we use them to recover the known results of the size-topology combination. We also generalize the main definition of qualitative formalism to include qualitative formalisms excluded from the definitions of the literature, important in the context of combinations.

### [476] [Scalable Delphi: Large Language Models for Structured Risk Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08889)
*Tobias Lorenz,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively replace traditional expert elicitation methods like Delphi, offering faster and scalable risk assessments with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Delphi method, while rigorous, is time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it impractical for most applications. The study explores if LLMs can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation.

Method: Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing.

Result: LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels.

Conclusion: LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes.

Abstract: Quantitative risk assessment in high-stakes domains relies on structured expert elicitation to estimate unobservable properties. The gold standard - the Delphi method - produces calibrated, auditable judgments but requires months of coordination and specialist time, placing rigorous risk assessment out of reach for most applications. We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as scalable proxies for structured expert elicitation. We propose Scalable Delphi, adapting the classical protocol for LLMs with diverse expert personas, iterative refinement, and rationale sharing. Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes.

TL;DR: STP框架通过时空剪枝提升dLLMs在RL中的效率和稳定性，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）在释放基于扩散的大语言模型（dLLMs）的复杂推理能力方面至关重要，但存在效率和稳定性挑战。

Method: 提出了时空剪枝（STP）框架，包括空间剪枝（利用静态先验约束探索空间）和时间剪枝（跳过冗余的后期细化步骤）。

Result: 理论分析表明STP严格降低了对数似然估计的方差，实验证明其在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STP框架通过空间和时间剪枝有效提升了基于扩散的大语言模型（dLLMs）在强化学习中的效率和稳定性，并在实验中超越了现有基线方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for unlocking the complex reasoning capabilities of Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs). However, applying RL to dLLMs faces unique challenges in efficiency and stability. To address these challenges, we propose Spatio-Temporal Pruning (STP), a framework designed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of RL for dLLMs. STP compresses the redundancy in the generative process through: (1) \textit{spatial pruning}, which constrains the exploration space using static priors; and (2) \textit{temporal pruning}, which bypasses redundant late-stage refinement steps. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that STP strictly reduces the variance of the log-likelihood estimation, thereby ensuring more stable policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STP surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lolo1222/STP.

TL;DR: CausalT5K是一个包含5000多个案例的因果推理诊断基准，通过测试关键能力（如阶梯崩溃检测、抗附和漂移和明智拒绝生成），揭示了LLM的失败模式，并为可信系统研究提供了基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法系统诊断LLM在因果推理中的失败（如附和、阶梯崩溃和错误拒绝），因此需要开发一个能全面测试关键能力的诊断工具。

Method: 通过人机协作流程，结合40位领域专家的参与、迭代交叉验证周期，以及基于规则、LLM和人工评分的复合验证，开发了包含10个领域5000多个案例的CausalT5K基准。

Result: 初步实验揭示了静态审计策略普遍失效的“四象限控制景观”，证明了CausalT5K在推动可信推理系统发展中的价值。

Conclusion: CausalT5K 作为一个诊断基准，揭示了 LLM 在因果推理中的系统性失败模式，并通过实用性和安全性的分解评估，为可信推理系统的进步提供了重要基础设施。

Abstract: LLM failures in causal reasoning, including sycophancy, rung collapse, and miscalibrated refusal, are well-documented, yet progress on remediation is slow because no benchmark enables systematic diagnosis. We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queries with associational evidence; (2) resisting sycophantic drift under adversarial pressure; and (3) generating Wise Refusals that specify missing information when evidence is underdetermined. Unlike synthetic benchmarks, CausalT5K embeds causal traps in realistic narratives and decomposes performance into Utility (sensitivity) and Safety (specificity), revealing failure modes invisible to aggregate accuracy. Developed through a rigorous human-machine collaborative pipeline involving 40 domain experts, iterative cross-validation cycles, and composite verification via rule-based, LLM, and human scoring, CausalT5K implements Pearl's Ladder of Causation as research infrastructure. Preliminary experiments reveal a Four-Quadrant Control Landscape where static audit policies universally fail, a finding that demonstrates CausalT5K's value for advancing trustworthy reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRefine是一种基于置信度的自我细化方法，显著减少计算成本，同时保持高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常依赖测试时的并行解码（如512个样本）来提高推理准确性，但这会带来巨大的计算成本。

Method: CoRefine采用了一个轻量级的211k参数Conv1D控制器，基于冻结的大型语言模型（LLM），通过全轨迹置信度来决定是否停止、重新检查或尝试不同方法，实现了有针对性的自我纠正。

Result: CoRefine平均每个问题仅需2.7次细化步骤，相对于512样本基线减少了约190倍的令牌使用，同时在多样化的推理基准和三个开源模型上，控制器在自信停止时达到了92.6%的精确度。

Conclusion: CoRefine通过将置信度作为控制信号而非正确性保证，为可扩展推理和代理设置提供了一个模块化原语，尤其在验证器不完善的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on test-time scaling via parallel decoding (for example, 512 samples) to boost reasoning accuracy, but this incurs substantial compute. We introduce CoRefine, a confidence-guided self-refinement method that achieves competitive accuracy using a fraction of the tokens via a lightweight 211k-parameter Conv1D controller atop a frozen LLM. The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers.

Method: 引入了SWM，一个模块化的世界模型研究生态系统，包括数据收集工具、标准化环境、规划算法和基线实现。每个环境还支持可控的变化因素，以支持鲁棒性和持续学习研究。

Result: 通过SWM，成功研究了DINO-WM中的零样本鲁棒性，展示了其在支持研究和标准化评估方面的实用性。

Conclusion: SWM（stable-worldmodel）作为一个模块化、经过测试且有文档的世界模型研究生态系统，通过提供高效的数据收集工具、标准化环境、规划算法和基线实现，显著提升了世界模型的可重用性、减少了错误风险，并增强了评估的标准化。

Abstract: World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.

Abstract: We introduce InternAgent-1.5, a unified system designed for end-to-end scientific discovery across computational and empirical domains. The system is built on a structured architecture composed of three coordinated subsystems for generation, verification, and evolution. These subsystems are supported by foundational capabilities for deep research, solution optimization, and long horizon memory. The architecture allows InternAgent-1.5 to operate continuously across extended discovery cycles while maintaining coherent and improving behavior. It also enables the system to coordinate computational modeling and laboratory experimentation within a single unified system. We evaluate InternAgent-1.5 on scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GAIA, HLE, GPQA, and FrontierScience, and the system achieves leading performance that demonstrates strong foundational capabilities. Beyond these benchmarks, we further assess two categories of discovery tasks. In algorithm discovery tasks, InternAgent-1.5 autonomously designs competitive methods for core machine learning problems. In empirical discovery tasks, it executes complete computational or wet lab experiments and produces scientific findings in earth, life, biological, and physical domains. Overall, these results show that InternAgent-1.5 provides a general and scalable framework for autonomous scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在解决复杂数学问题方面表现出潜力，但其准确性和一致性仍有不足。强化学习框架可用于对齐任务特定奖励，提高质量和可靠性。

Method: iGRPO是一种两阶段扩展的GRPO方法，通过模型生成的草稿实现动态自条件化。第一阶段采样多个探索性草稿并选择最高奖励的草稿；第二阶段将该草稿附加到原始提示中，并在草稿条件下进行GRPO风格的更新。

Result: iGRPO在匹配的 rollout 预算下持续优于GRPO，并在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到85.62%和79.64%的新最先进结果。

Conclusion: iGRPO展示了迭代、自反馈式强化学习在提升可验证数学推理能力方面的潜力，并在多个基准测试中实现了新的最先进结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving complex mathematical problems, yet they still fall short of producing accurate and consistent solutions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\% and 79.64\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse. These results underscore the potential of iterative, self-feedback-based RL for advancing verifiable mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种分层数据管理框架（L0-L4），通过模型与数据的协同进化，显著提升了LLM的训练效率和性能。实验验证了该框架的有效性，并开源了相关数据集和工具。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence can be viewed as an evolution of data-driven learning paradigms, with successive shifts in data organization and utilization continuously driving advances in model capability. Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.
