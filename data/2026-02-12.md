*Leo Thomas Ramos,Angel D. Sappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCSAFNet通过多分支编码器-解码器架构和特征融合技术，显著提升多光谱土地覆盖分割性能，并在紧凑版本中保持高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多光谱图像土地覆盖分割任务，现有方法在处理不同光谱配置时存在性能局限，需设计更高效的模型以结合空间与光谱信息。

Method: 采用多分支编码器-解码器架构，分别处理可见与非可见通道，并通过融合解码器结合多尺度特征。引入CBAM注意力和ASAU激活函数优化特征融合与训练稳定性。

Result: 在FBP数据集上，MeCSAFNet-base (6c)相比U-Net和SegFormer提升14.72%-19.62% mIoU；在Potsdam数据集上，MeCSAFNet-large (4c)相比DeepLabV3+和SegFormer提升4.80%-9.11% mIoU。

Conclusion: MeCSAFNet在多种光谱配置下均表现出显著的性能提升，尤其是在FBP和Potsdam数据集上超越了现有方法。其紧凑版本在资源受限环境中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）已经彻底改变了图表理解领域，但该领域的MLLM基础分析仍然分散且缺乏系统性组织。

Method: 我们首先分析了图表中视觉和语言信息融合的基本挑战，然后对下游任务和数据集进行分类，引入了一种新的分类法来突出领域的扩展范围。接着，我们全面梳理了方法论的演进，从经典深度学习技术到最先进的MLLM范式。

Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.

### [3] [MPA: Multimodal Prototype Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10143)
*Liwen Wu,Wei Wang,Lei Zhao,Zhan Gao,Qika Lin,Shaowen Yao,Zuozhu Liu,Bin Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA是一种多模态原型增强小样本学习框架，通过语言模型增强语义、多视角增强特征多样性和吸收不确定样本，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本学习方法仅关注视觉模态，缺乏多模态信息的综合利用，导致性能受限。

Method: MPA框架包含LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE)、Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA)和Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA)三个模块，分别通过语言模型增强语义、多视角增强特征多样性和吸收不确定样本。

Result: 在四个单领域和六个跨领域基准测试中，MPA在大多数设置下优于现有方法，特别是在5-way 1-shot设置中，单领域和跨领域分别比第二名高出12.29%和24.56%。

Conclusion: MPA框架在单领域和跨领域的小样本学习任务中均显著优于现有方法，特别是在5-way 1-shot设置下表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Recently, few-shot learning (FSL) has become a popular task that aims to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples and has been widely applied in fields such as natural science, remote sensing, and medical images. However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.

### [4] [VERA: Identifying and Leveraging Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads in Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10146)
*Rongcan Pei,Huan Li,Fang Guo,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文通过分析VLMs的长上下文处理机制，提出VERA框架，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理长上下文和复杂推理任务时的性能瓶颈。

Method: 通过注意力分析识别VER Heads，提出VERA框架，利用模型不确定性触发视觉证据的显式表达。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct和GLM-4.1V-Thinking的平均相对改进分别为21.3%和20.1%。

Conclusion: VERA框架通过检测模型不确定性并显式表达视觉证据，显著提升了开源VLMs的长上下文理解能力，平均相对改进达到21.3%和20.1%。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in textual understanding, they face significant challenges when handling long context and complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RVMS-Bench是一个面向现实世界视频记忆搜索的评估系统，包含多样本和多维描述框架，结合RACLO框架模拟人类认知过程，实验显示现有模型在此类任务中仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频检索基准无法反映现实世界中模糊、多维记忆的搜索需求，因此需要开发更贴近实际场景的评估系统和方法。

Method: 通过构建包含1,440个样本的RVMS-Bench数据集，采用分层描述框架（全局印象、关键时刻、时间上下文和听觉记忆），并结合人类验证协议。提出RACLO框架，模拟人类“回忆-搜索-验证”的认知过程。

Result: 实验表明，现有MLLMs在基于模糊记忆的视频检索和时刻定位任务中表现不足。

Conclusion: 本文提出了RVMS-Bench和RACLO框架，旨在提升现实世界中基于模糊记忆的视频检索和时刻定位能力，并指出现有MLLMs在此类任务中的不足。

Abstract: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, failing to reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web. We present \textbf{RVMS-Bench}, a comprehensive system for evaluating real-world video memory search. It consists of \textbf{1,440 samples} spanning \textbf{20 diverse categories} and \textbf{four duration groups}, sourced from \textbf{real-world open-web videos}. RVMS-Bench utilizes a hierarchical description framework encompassing \textbf{Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, and Auditory Memory} to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with all samples strictly verified via a human-in-the-loop protocol. We further propose \textbf{RACLO}, an agentic framework that employs abductive reasoning to simulate the human ``Recall-Search-Verify'' cognitive process, effectively addressing the challenge of searching for videos via fuzzy memories in the real world. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories. We believe this work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios.

### [6] [AD$^2$: Analysis and Detection of Adversarial Threats in Visual Perception for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10160)
*Ishan Sahu,Somnath Hazra,Somak Aditya,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现自动驾驶系统易受物理和数字攻击影响，提出轻量级AD$^2$检测模型，显著提升对抗性鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统的端到端性能已显著提升，但其对抗性鲁棒性尚未充分探索，存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 通过闭环评估在CARLA中对三种代表性攻击向量（物理模糊攻击、电磁干扰攻击和数字攻击）进行测试，并设计了基于注意力机制的AD$^2$检测模型。

Result: 实验显示Transfuser和Interfuser等先进代理在攻击下驾驶评分下降高达99%，而AD$^2$在多摄像头输入下表现出卓越的检测能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: 论文提出了AD$^2$模型，一种基于注意力机制的轻量级攻击检测方法，能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在对抗性攻击下的安全性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have achieved significant progress, yet their adversarial robustness remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管3DGS在多种应用中表现出潜力，但从野外捕获中提取可用对象及可控编辑技术仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种快速AI驱动的方法，将用户引导的2D选择掩码传播到3DGS选择中，并结合灵活的手动选择和分割工具。

Result: 工具集在3DGS选择方面优于现有技术，并通过定制视频扩散模型实现了用户引导的局部编辑。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一套交互式工具集，用于3D高斯溅射（3DGS）的选择和分割，并通过用户引导的局部编辑方法展示了其在下游应用中的实用性。

Abstract: Representation in the family of 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) are growing into a viable alternative to traditional graphics for an expanding number of application, including recent techniques that facilitate physics simulation and animation. However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify. Our selection and editing tools can be used for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

### [8] [When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10179)
*Jiacheng Hou,Yining Sun,Ruochong Jin,Haochen Han,Fangming Liu,Wai Kin Victor Chan,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出视觉中心越狱攻击（VJA）及防御方法，揭示视觉输入的安全风险，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉提示编辑的普及带来了新的安全风险，即攻击面变为视觉输入，亟需研究其威胁及防御方法。

Method: 提出了Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA)和IESBench基准，通过视觉输入传递恶意指令，并采用内省多模态推理进行防御。

Result: VJA对商业模型的攻击成功率高达80.9%（Nano Banana Pro）和70.1%（GPT-Image-1.5），提出的防御方法显著提升了安全性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了视觉中心越狱攻击（VJA）对现代图像编辑模型的安全威胁，并提出了一种无需训练的防御方法，显著提升了模型的安全性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems. Warning: This paper contains offensive images created by large image editing models.

*El Hadji S. Diop,Thierno Fall,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过几何方法和欧几里得群等变性改进DDPM，实验证明性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DDPM在几何关键特征提取和网络等变性方面的不足，特别是U-net架构仅具有平移等变性的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种结合黎曼流形中的群形态卷积和Hamilton-Jacobi型PDE的方法，通过特性方法求解以更好地捕捉非线性、薄几何结构并融入对称性。

Result: 在MNIST、RotoMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验结果显示，相比基线DDPM模型有明显改进。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入几何方法和欧几里得群的等变性，显著提升了DDPM在几何关键特征提取和网络等变性方面的表现。

Abstract: In this work, we address two major issues in recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM): {\bf 1)} geometric key feature extraction and {\bf 2)} network equivariance. Since the DDPM prediction network relies on the U-net architecture, which is theoretically only translation equivariant, we introduce a geometric approach combined with an equivariance property of the more general Euclidean group, which includes rotations, reflections, and permutations. We introduce the notion of group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, which are derived from the viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that act as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. We add a convection term to the model and solve it using the method of characteristics. This helps us better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process. Experimental results on the MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to the baseline DDPM model.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在关键领域应用受限的问题，因其生成模型和分类缺乏可解释性。

Method: 采用基于体素聚合的PointNet主干网络和新型可逆正交变换，解耦特征通道以增强可解释性。

Result: 用户研究显示，XSPLAIN的解释方式显著优于基线（p<0.001），48.4%的参与者选择其为最佳。

Conclusion: XSPLAIN显著提升了3D高斯溅射分类的可解释性，通过原型框架和严格保持决策边界的方法，赢得了用户的高度信任。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a standard for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, yet its adoption in multiple critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability of the generation models as well as classification of the Splats. While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的行人检测数据集缺乏对使用助行器的行人的关注，因此需要创建一个专门的数据集以填补这一空白。

Method: 研究收集了户外环境中使用轮椅、拐杖和助行器的行人数据，分为九类。在MMDetection框架下实现了七种目标检测模型和三种跟踪算法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，YOLOX、Deformable DETR和Faster R-CNN在检测性能上表现最佳，而三种跟踪算法之间的差异较小。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个名为PMMA的新数据集，专注于使用助行器的行人检测，并公开了数据集和代码，为相关研究提供了基准。

Abstract: This study introduces a new object detection dataset of pedestrians using mobility aids, named PMMA. The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small. The PMMA dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/XJPQUG, and the video processing and model training code is available at https://github.com/DatasetPMMA/PMMA.

TL;DR: 研究开发了首个经色度计验证的皮肤镜肤色估计神经网络，用于快速肤色标注和偏差审计，发现肤色类型V和VI在数据集中占比极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共皮肤镜数据集中缺乏可靠的肤色标注，限制了基于神经网络的皮肤病诊断模型的公平性审计。

Method: 使用序数回归预测Fitzpatrick皮肤类型，通过颜色回归预测个体类型角度（ITA），并利用合成和真实的皮肤镜及临床图像进行广泛的预训练。

Result: Fitzpatrick模型与人类众包标注的一致性相当，ITA预测与色度计测量的ITA高度一致，显著优于像素平均方法。在ISIC 2020和MILK10k数据集中，少于1%的受试者属于Fitzpatrick类型V和VI。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了首个经过色度计验证的皮肤镜肤色估计神经网络，并开源了代码和预训练模型，用于快速肤色标注和偏差审计，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Neural-network-based diagnosis from dermatoscopic images is increasingly used for clinical decision support, yet studies report performance disparities across skin tones. Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Applying these estimators to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k, we find that fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI. We release code and pretrained models as an open-source tool for rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing. This is, to our knowledge, the first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation neural network validated against colorimeter measurements, and it supports growing evidence of clinically relevant performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

TL;DR: ERGO通过动态调整损失权重，有效利用不完美的监督信号，提升单图像3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像生成3D内容因遮挡区域信息缺失而具有挑战性，现有生成模型的辅助视图存在几何不一致和纹理错位问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于超额风险分解的自适应优化框架ERGO，将3D高斯溅射的优化损失分解为超额风险和贝叶斯误差，并引入几何感知和纹理感知目标。

Result: 在Google Scanned Objects和OmniObject3D数据集上的实验表明，ERGO在几何和纹理质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ERGO框架通过动态估计视图特定的超额风险并自适应调整损失权重，显著提升了3D重建的几何保真度和纹理质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了防止对抗攻击算法滥用影响扩散模型的实际应用，开发相应的防御策略至关重要。

Method: LoRD引入了合并思想和平衡参数，结合低秩适应（LoRA）模块，构建了一个防御流程来检测和防御对抗样本。

Result: 在面部和风景图像上的大量实验表明，LoRD的防御性能显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks for diffusion models as well as their fine-tuning process have been developed rapidly. To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.

TL;DR: UA-Flow通过预测速度场及其不确定性提升样本可靠性，实验显示其优于基线方法并优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于采样的生成模型（如流匹配）取得了显著成功，但仍可能产生质量不一致或下降的样本。

Method: 提出了不确定性感知流匹配（UA-Flow），作为流匹配的轻量级扩展，预测速度场及其异方差不确定性，并通过流动力学传播速度不确定性来估计样本级不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，UA-Flow生成的不确定性信号与样本保真度的相关性高于基线方法，且不确定性引导采样进一步提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: UA-Flow通过预测速度场及其异方差不确定性，有效提升了样本生成的可靠性，并通过不确定性引导进一步优化生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.

*Rafael-Petruţ Gardoş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了政治深度伪造的检测方法，提出了一种不确定性感知的检测框架，通过校准概率输出和不确定性估计，支持风险感知的审核策略，并分析了其在政治场景中的操作价值与局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 生成图像模型的进步使得高度逼真的政治深度伪造成为可能，这对信息完整性、公众信任和民主进程构成风险。现有的深度伪造检测系统大多仅提供点预测，无法指示输出何时不可靠，这在高风险政治场景中是一个关键的操作限制。

Conclusion: 校准的概率输出和不确定性估计能够支持风险感知的审核策略，同时系统性的置信带分析揭示了不确定性在政治场景中的操作价值与局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率数字全息中MLE重建因高维矩阵求逆计算成本过高而无法应用的问题。

Method: 提出了一种随机线性代数方法，利用传感矩阵的结构特性和共轭梯度进行似然梯度评估，避免了显式矩阵求逆。

Conclusion: PGD-MC框架为有限孔径数字全息提供了一种灵活且有效的基于MLE的重建方法，在准确性和速度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: In coherent imaging, speckle is statistically modeled as multiplicative noise, posing a fundamental challenge for image reconstruction. While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: 开源深度学习管道Comp2Comp（AAQ和BMD）通过严格验证，展示了临床应用的准确性，提高了透明度和可测试性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能可以从已获取的放射学图像中自动提取成像生物标志物，这种机会性成像范式为医学成像增加了价值，无需额外的成像成本或患者辐射暴露。然而，许多开源图像分析解决方案缺乏严格的验证，而商业解决方案缺乏透明度，导致部署时出现意外失败。

Method: 开发并验证了两个完全开源、FDA-510(k)批准的深度学习管道：Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ)和Bone Mineral Density (BMD)估计，均包含在Comp2Comp包中，用于计算机断层扫描的机会性分析。AAQ通过分割腹部主动脉评估动脉瘤大小；BMD通过分割椎体估计骨小梁密度和骨质疏松风险。

Result: AAQ在258例患者扫描中的最大主动脉直径与放射科医生的真实测量结果相比，平均绝对误差为1.57毫米（95% CI 1.38-1.80毫米）。BMD在371例患者扫描中的二元分类（低骨密度与正常骨密度）与DXA扫描的真实结果相比，敏感性为81.0%（95% CI 74.0-86.8%），特异性为78.4%（95% CI 72.3-83.7%）。

Conclusion: Comp2Comp AAQ和BMD展示了足够的准确性，适用于临床应用。开源这些算法提高了FDA审批过程的透明度，允许医院在繁琐的临床试点之前测试算法，并为研究人员提供了最佳方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse multimodal tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias. Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChangeTitans框架在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其在遥感变化检测中的有效性和计算效率。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and related applications. However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that ChangeTitans achieves state-of-the-art results, attaining \textbf{84.36\%} IoU and \textbf{91.52\%} F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种自适应LiDAR感知框架，通过动态调整传感器参数，联合优化LiDAR采集和配准超参数，显著提升了配准精度和效率，展示了自适应LiDAR在自主感知和机器人应用中的潜力。

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are a key modality for 3D perception, yet they are typically designed independently of downstream tasks such as point cloud registration. Conventional registration operates on pre-acquired datasets with fixed LiDAR configurations, leading to suboptimal data collection and significant computational overhead for sampling, noise filtering, and parameter tuning. In this work, we propose an adaptive LiDAR sensing framework that dynamically adjusts sensor parameters, jointly optimizing LiDAR acquisition and registration hyperparameters. By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency. Evaluations in the CARLA simulation demonstrate that our method outperforms fixed-parameter baselines while retaining generalization abilities, highlighting the potential of adaptive LiDAR for autonomous perception and robotic applications.

Abstract: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.

Abstract: This study introduces the Garbage Dataset (GD), a publicly available image dataset designed to advance automated waste segregation through machine learning and computer vision. It's a diverse dataset covering 10 common household waste categories: metal, glass, biological, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes, and plastic. The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment. The dataset is publicly released to support further research in environmental sustainability applications.

Conclusion: Med-SegLens通过潜在特征分解和干预，为分割模型的故障诊断和数据偏移缓解提供了实用且机制化的工具。

Abstract: Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

Conclusion: CoLin 提供了一种新颖且高效的视觉基础模型部署解决方案，首次以仅1%的参数超越了全微调和经典 delta-tuning 方法。

Abstract: Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.

Conclusion: 3DXTalker通过数据驱动的身份建模、丰富的音频表示和空间动态可控性，成功实现了在3D说话头像生成中的卓越性能，整合了唇同步、情感表达和头部姿态动态。

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在分类式任务上表现良好，但在需要复杂空间推理的高级任务上仍有不足。

Abstract: Maps are powerful carriers of structured and contextual knowledge, encompassing geography, demographics, infrastructure, and environmental patterns. Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.

TL;DR: 提出一种文本引导框架，通过文本增强和多尺度融合模块，显著提升多模态视频异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本模态在弱监督多模态视频异常检测中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。文本能提供明确的语义信息，有助于增强异常表征并减少误报。然而，通用语言模型难以捕捉异常特定细节且相关描述稀缺，导致文本特征提取困难。此外，多模态融合常面临冗余和不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的文本引导框架通过多阶段文本增强和多尺度瓶颈Transformer融合模块，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能，并在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上达到了最先进的水平。

Abstract: Weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection has gained significant attention, yet the potential of the text modality remains under-explored. Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance. Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: C^2RoPE改进RoPE，通过混合位置索引和Chebyshev因果掩码解决多模态处理中的空间连续性和因果依赖问题，提升3D LMMs性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在多模态处理中存在局限性：1D时间位置索引破坏视觉特征的连续性，导致空间局部性丢失；RoPE的因果假设导致长序列中早期视觉令牌被忽略。

Method: 提出C^2RoPE，结合1D时间位置和基于笛卡尔的空间坐标构建混合位置索引，并采用频率分配策略编码时空位置信息；引入Chebyshev因果掩码，通过计算2D空间中图像令牌的Chebyshev距离确定因果依赖关系。

Result: 在3D场景推理和3D视觉问答等基准测试中，C^2RoPE表现出显著有效性。

Conclusion: C^2RoPE通过引入局部空间连续性和空间因果关系的显式建模，有效解决了RoPE在多模态处理中的局限性，提升了3D LMMs的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness. The code is be available at https://github.com/ErikZ719/C2RoPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图像隐喻理解任务中表现不佳，缺乏对文化、情感和上下文隐含意义的理解能力。

Method: 提出了MetaphorStar框架，包含TFQ-Data数据集、TFQ-GRPO视觉强化学习方法及TFQ-Bench基准测试。

Result: MetaphorStar-32B在多项测试中表现优异，平均性能提升82.6%，并在部分任务上超越主流闭源模型。

Conclusion: MetaphorStar框架通过TFQ-GRPO方法和TFQ-Data数据集显著提升了图像隐喻理解任务的表现，并在多项基准测试中达到SOTA水平。此外，该方法还提升了模型的通用视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

Motivation: 现有UIE方法忽视不同场景组件的不一致退化，导致颜色失真和细节丢失。

Method: 提出SUCode（语义感知水下码本网络），采用三阶段训练范式，结合GCAM和FAFF模块进行通道和频率线索整合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SUCode在参考和无参考指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SUCode通过语义感知的离散码本表示实现了自适应的水下图像增强，在多个基准测试中表现出色，超越了现有的UIE方法。

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical and lightweight solution for enhancing child detection in low-quality surveillance footage, a critical component in real-world missing child alert and daycare monitoring systems. Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

Conclusion: VRFT-Aug框架通过结合视觉感知和结构化推理，显著提升了医学影像领域的强化微调效果，为高风险医疗应用提供了可靠且具备推理能力的模型开发指导。

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

Abstract: Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在2D流形中操作时忽略3D几何结构导致的几何不对齐问题，特别是垂直立面（宏观结构）和尺度变化（微观尺度）对特征对齐的严重影响。

Method: 提出了一种基于几何的框架(MGS)$^2$，包含宏观几何结构过滤（MGSF）模块和微观几何尺度适应（MGSA）模块，以及几何-外观对比蒸馏（GACD）损失函数。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上分别达到了97.5%和97.02%的Recall@1，表现出卓越的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: (MGS)$^2$框架在跨视角地理定位任务中表现出色，特别是在处理几何不对齐问题时，通过结合宏观几何结构过滤和微观几何尺度适应模块，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Conclusion: GenDR-Pix通过消除VAE瓶颈，实现了2.8倍的加速和60%的内存节省，且视觉质量几乎无损失，能够在1秒内恢复4K图像。

Abstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

Method: 论文提出了VideoSTF框架，通过三种互补的n-gram指标形式化重复问题，并提供了一个包含10,000个多样化视频的标准化测试平台及受控时间变换库。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了现代视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）中输出重复这一基本稳定性问题，并推动了视频-语言系统的稳定性评估。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种全局框架下的神经辐射场方法，能泛化预测3D工作空间占用，适用于机器人操作，重建误差26mm。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统以相机为中心的坐标方法在机器人操作中的局限性，提出一种在全局工作空间框架下预测3D占用情况的方法。

Method: 模型采用全局工作空间框架构建占用表示，整合灵活的源视图，无需场景特定微调即可泛化到新的物体排列。

Result: 在40个真实场景上训练后，模型实现了26mm的重建误差，包括遮挡区域，验证了其超越传统立体视觉方法推断完整3D占用的能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的全局工作空间框架下的可泛化神经辐射场方法，能够有效预测3D工作空间占用情况，适用于机器人操作，且在未经场景特定微调的情况下，对未见过的物体排列具有泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce a Generalizable Neural Radiance Field approach for predicting 3D workspace occupancy from egocentric robot observations. Unlike prior methods operating in camera-centric coordinates, our model constructs occupancy representations in a global workspace frame, making it directly applicable to robotic manipulation. The model integrates flexible source views and generalizes to unseen object arrangements without scene-specific finetuning. We demonstrate the approach on a humanoid robot and evaluate predicted geometry against 3D sensor ground truth. Trained on 40 real scenes, our model achieves 26mm reconstruction error, including occluded regions, validating its ability to infer complete 3D occupancy beyond traditional stereo vision methods.

TL;DR: 提出TwiFF模型和TwiFF-2.7M数据集，解决动态视觉问答问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCoT方法局限于静态场景，难以捕捉时间动态，无法满足指令、预测和相机运动等任务需求。

Method: 提出TwiFF模型，结合预训练视频生成和图像理解能力，迭代生成未来动作帧和文本推理线索。

Result: TwiFF在动态推理任务中表现优异，TwiFF-2.7M数据集和TwiFF-Bench评估基准为研究提供了支持。

Conclusion: TwiFF模型在动态视觉问答任务中显著优于现有的VCoT方法和文本链式思维基线，验证了其在动态场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

TL;DR: PP-DNN通过动态选择关键帧和ROIs，显著提升AV感知可预测性，减少处理数据量，同时保持准确性，评估显示性能大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的感知管道中，实时DNN推理面临计算需求与有限资源之间的巨大差距，现有研究多通过压缩DNN模型优化推理时间，而PP-DNN则通过减少需处理的图像数据量来实现更快的感知。

Method: PP-DNN利用ROI生成器识别关键帧和ROIs，通过FLOPs预测器预测MACs，并协调多个DNN模型处理关键帧和ROIs，同时设计了检测预测器处理非关键帧。

Result: 在BDD100K和nuScenes数据集上的评估显示，PP-DNN显著提升了感知可预测性，融合帧数增加7.3倍，融合延迟减少>2.6倍，融合延迟变异减少>2.3倍，检测完整性提高75.4%，成本效益提升高达98%。

Conclusion: PP-DNN系统通过动态选择关键帧和感兴趣区域（ROIs），显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的感知可预测性，同时保持了多租户DNN的准确性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

Conclusion: OmniVL-Guard通过其核心设计（Self-Evolving CoT Generation和ARSPO）有效解决了多模态伪造检测与定位中的难度偏差问题，显著提升了性能并展现出零样本鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Self-driving cars hold significant potential to reduce traffic accidents, alleviate congestion, and enhance urban mobility. However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems. The code can be found here https://github.com/KiaRational/AurigaNet.

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合深度估计和动作辅助模块，显著提升了VLA模型在3D环境中的感知和控制能力，为机器人系统的2D到3D决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的无训练频率调制方法通过动态衰减的频率相关权重函数，有效平衡了结构保持与语义更新，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Motivation: 稀疏或有限角度几何下的X射线CT图像重建极具挑战性，数据缺失通常导致重建图像中的伪影甚至物体变形，因此深度生成模型在此背景下具有巨大潜力和成功可能。

Method: 结合扩散生成模型与迭代优化算法，用于从稀疏几何获取的sinogram重建CT图像，同时保持模型的可解释性并引入神经网络的生成能力。

Result: 在高度稀疏几何条件下获得的结果非常令人鼓舞。

Conclusion: 尽管在高度稀疏几何条件下获得的结果非常令人鼓舞，但这一方向仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.

Result: 在真实超分辨率图像质量评估基准测试中，S3 RIQA表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: S3 RIQA方法在真实超分辨率图像质量评估任务中表现优异，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在遥感（RS）任务中表现出色，但幻觉问题（与输入RS图像不一致的响应）阻碍了其在高风险场景中的应用。目前RS领域的幻觉问题研究不足，因此需要系统性探索和解决方案。

Method: 论文通过构建RSHalluEval基准（2,023 QA对）和RSHalluCheck数据集（15,396 QA对）来评估和检测幻觉。此外，还提出了RSHalluShield数据集（30k QA对）用于训练友好型缓解，并设计了无需训练的即插即用策略，如解码时对数校正和RS感知提示。

Result: 实验表明，论文提出的缓解策略在代表性RS-MLLMs中，将无幻觉率提高了高达21.63个百分点，同时在下游任务（RSVQA/RSVG）中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了RSHallu，一个系统性的研究，包括三个主要成果：RS幻觉的正式定义与分类、幻觉评估基准RSHalluEval的构建，以及训练友好型数据集RSHalluShield和无需训练的即插即用缓解策略。这些成果显著提升了RS-MLLMs的幻觉抑制能力，同时保持了在下游任务中的竞争力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

TL;DR: FlowCache是首个专为自回归视频生成设计的缓存框架，通过分块缓存和优化压缩机制显著加速生成，质量几乎无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在生成超长视频时速度慢，现有缓存方法假设所有帧在相同时间步具有统一的去噪模式，这在自回归模型中不适用。

Method: 提出了FlowCache框架，采用分块缓存策略和联合重要性-冗余优化的KV缓存压缩机制，动态适应每个视频块的独特去噪特性。

Result: 在MAGI-1和SkyReels-V2上分别实现了2.38倍和6.7倍的加速，且质量下降可忽略（VBench分别增加0.87和减少0.79）。

Conclusion: FlowCache成功释放了自回归模型在实时、超长视频生成中的潜力，为大规模高效视频合成设立了新基准。

Abstract: Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

Abstract: Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

Abstract: Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

Abstract: Computer graphics, comprising both raster and vector components, is a fundamental part of modern science, industry, and digital communication. While raster graphics offer ease of use, its pixel-based structure limits scalability. Vector graphics, defined by mathematical primitives, provides scalability without quality loss, however, it is more complex to produce. For design and architecture, the versatility of vector graphics is paramount, despite its computational demands. This paper introduces a novel method for generating vector residential plans from textual descriptions. Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. Additionally, we present a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images. Such images have a better CLIPscore compared to others by about 4%.

TL;DR: ViLaVT通过语言引导的动态视觉编码和两阶段训练，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）通常依赖单次视觉编码的纯文本推理，导致细粒度视觉信息丢失。虽然'thinking with images'尝试通过外部工具或代码操作图像来缓解这一问题，但其视觉状态在语言语义上不够充分，影响了跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出了一种名为'chatting with images'的新框架，通过语言引导的特征调制实现视觉状态的动态更新。ViLaVT模型配备了专为交互式视觉推理设计的动态视觉编码器，并采用两阶段课程训练（监督微调和强化学习）来优化推理行为。

Result: 在八个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViLaVT实现了显著且一致的性能提升，尤其是在复杂多图像和视频空间推理任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: ViLaVT框架通过语言引导的特征调制和动态视觉编码器，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂多图像和视频空间推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

Method: 提出Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM)，分解PF-ODE轨迹并选择三个关键子轨迹作为优化目标，结合连续时间CM目标和流匹配作为边界正则化器。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256数据集上，DE-CM在一步生成中取得了1.70的FID分数，优于现有基于CM的一步方法。

Conclusion: DE-CM通过选择关键子轨迹簇实现了稳定有效的训练，并在ImageNet 256x256数据集上以1.70的FID分数在一步生成中表现优异。

Abstract: The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

Conclusion: DMP-3DAD 提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，适用于实际的跨类别3D异常检测，且在少样本设置下达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

Conclusion: DISBench 提出了一个具有挑战性的基准，强调了在新一代检索系统中融入代理推理的必要性。

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

Conclusion: DC-SFT通过基于样本难度显式过滤训练集，显著提升了OOD泛化性能，超越了基于RL的训练方法，同时提供了更高的稳定性和计算效率。

Abstract: The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

Abstract: Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.

Abstract: Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

Conclusion: Stride-Net通过解耦和可学习掩码技术，成功实现了在保持高诊断准确性的同时提升公平性，为医学影像分析中的公平性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出Chart Specification作为结构化中间表示，通过强化学习提升图表到代码生成的结构保真度，实验显示在数据效率和性能上均显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要依赖监督微调，鼓励表面级别的标记模仿而非对底层图表结构的忠实建模，导致输出存在幻觉或语义不一致。

Method: 提出了Chart Specification，一种结构化的中间表示，将训练从文本模仿转向语义基础监督。通过Spec-Align Reward提供细粒度的、可验证的结构正确性反馈，支持强化学习以强制一致的绘图逻辑。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，该方法始终优于先前的方法。仅用3K训练样本就实现了强大的数据效率，在复杂基准测试中领先基线高达61.7%，扩展到4K样本时在所有评估指标上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 精确的结构监督为高保真度的图表到代码生成提供了一条高效路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

Method: 提出Temporal Residual World Model（TR-World）专注于动态物体建模，通过计算场景表示的时间残差提取动态物体信息，并结合静态物体信息预测未来BEV特征；同时提出Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement（FGTR）模块，通过先验轨迹与未来BEV特征的交互优化轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，ResWorld在规划性能上达到最优。

Conclusion: ResWorld方法在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上实现了最先进的规划性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

Motivation: 现有USP实现存在内核启动开销过大和计算-通信调度次优的问题，影响了大规模扩散模型的推理效率。

Method: FastUSP结合了编译级优化（CUDA Graphs和计算-通信重排序）、通信级优化（FP8量化集体通信）和算子级优化（双缓冲流水线Ring注意力）。

Result: 在FLUX模型上，FastUSP实现了1.12×--1.16×的端到端加速；在Qwen-Image模型上，2 GPU场景下加速1.09×，但4--8 GPU因兼容性问题未实现编译优化。

Conclusion: FastUSP通过多级优化框架显著提升了大规模扩散模型的推理效率，尤其在FLUX模型上表现突出。尽管在Qwen-Image模型上因PyTorch Inductor兼容性问题限制了优化效果，但整体仍优于基线USP。

Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

Conclusion: DFIC数据集不仅提升了自动化ICAO合规验证方法的性能，还增强了面部识别系统的安全性、隐私性和公平性。

Abstract: Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在图像分类中表现出色，但其注意力机制往往不透明且呈现密集、非结构化行为，因此需要改进。

Method: 将先前提出的SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA)机制应用于ViT架构，引入了几何基础的公式，增强了可解释性、稀疏性和频谱结构。

Conclusion: 本文为可解释AI、频谱诊断和基于注意力的模型压缩的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

Conclusion: SVDA通过将可学习的对角矩阵嵌入到归一化的查询-键交互中，为密集预测任务提供了一种光谱结构化的注意力机制，不仅保持了预测准确性，还提供了六种光谱指标，重新定义了单目深度估计的可解释性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Conclusion: LaSSM在保持竞争力的同时，通过简化设计和提高效率，显著提升了3D场景实例分割的性能，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM.

Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.

Conclusion: FastFlow是一种即插即用的自适应推理框架，通过智能跳过计算步骤显著加速流匹配模型的生成过程，同时保持高质量输出。

Abstract: Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

Method: HairWeaver采用两个轻量级模块：Motion-Context-LoRA用于整合运动条件，Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA用于保持不同数据域中的照片级真实外观。这些模块指导视频扩散主干，同时保持其核心生成能力。

Conclusion: HairWeaver通过其创新的模块和专用数据集训练，成功实现了对头发动态的精细控制，生成了高度逼真且自然的头发动画，设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCritic是一种针对物理AI优化的多模态批评模型，通过两阶段训练流程提升评判稳定性和物理正确性，在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有批评模型主要针对通用视觉领域（如字幕生成或图像问答），而涉及感知、因果推理和规划的物理AI任务尚未充分探索，因此需要开发专门优化的批评模型。

Method: 采用两阶段的RLVR流程：物理技能预热阶段增强物理导向的感知和推理，随后进行自我参照的批评微调，批评模型在评判候选响应前生成自己的预测作为内部参考。

Result: PhyCritic在物理和通用多模态评判基准上均取得显著性能提升，作为策略模型应用时进一步改善了物理基础任务的感知和推理。

Conclusion: PhyCritic作为一种多模态批评模型，通过两阶段的RLVR流程优化，在物理AI任务中表现出色，不仅在物理和通用多模态评判基准上超越了开源基线，还进一步提升了物理基础任务中的感知和推理能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

TL;DR: SurfPhase 是一种新型模型，通过结合动态高斯表面元和视频扩散技术，从稀疏相机视图中重建3D界面动力学，适用于处理尖锐、可变的液-汽界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相流中的界面动力学对动量、热和质量传递至关重要，但现有实验测量技术难以处理移动界面，且现有神经渲染方法无法处理尖锐、可变的液-汽界面。

Method: 结合动态高斯表面元与符号距离函数以确保几何一致性，并利用视频扩散模型从稀疏观测中优化重建。

Result: 在新收集的高速池沸腾视频数据集上，仅需两个相机视图即可实现高质量的视图合成和速度估计。

Conclusion: SurfPhase 成功地从稀疏相机视图中重建了3D界面动力学，展示了高质量的新视角视频合成和速度估计能力。

Abstract: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.

### [84] [The Complexity of Bayesian Network Learning: Revisiting the Superstructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10253)
*Robert Ganian,Viktoriia Korchemna*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: BNSL问题在反馈边集参数化下是固定参数可解的，加性表示可进一步降低复杂度至树宽参数化。结果扩展至Polytree Learning。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BNSL问题在理论和实证研究中备受关注，但其参数化复杂度尚未完全明确。本文旨在填补这一空白，尤其是针对不同参数化方法和输入表示对问题复杂度的系统性影响。

Method: 本文采用参数化复杂度理论，重点分析BNSL问题在不同参数（如顶点覆盖、反馈边集、树宽）下的计算复杂度。通过理论证明和复杂度分类，探讨了输入表示（非零表示与加性表示）对问题的影响。

Result: 研究证明，BNSL在反馈边集参数化下是固定参数可解的，且这一结果可扩展至局部化反馈边集。加性表示的使用进一步降低了复杂度，使问题在树宽参数化下仍保持固定参数可解性。

Conclusion: 本文通过不同的参数化方法（如反馈边集大小和局部化反馈边集）展示了BNSL问题的固定参数可解性，并提供了相应的下界，完善了BNSL的复杂度分类。此外，研究还表明输入表示方式（如加性表示）对问题复杂度有显著影响，并在树宽参数化下实现固定参数可解性。结果还扩展至Polytree Learning问题。

Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of Bayesian Network Structure Learning (BNSL), a classical problem that has received significant attention in empirical but also purely theoretical studies. We follow up on previous works that have analyzed the complexity of BNSL w.r.t. the so-called superstructure of the input. While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.
  We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone. Last but not least, we show how our results can be extended to the closely related problem of Polytree Learning.

*Mateusz Basiak,Marcin Bienkowski,Guy Even,Agnieszka Tatarczuk*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对环形网络在线二分问题的随机算法，通过资源增强和状态空间限制，显著提升了竞争比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究环形网络中的在线二分问题，以解决分布式机器学习中环形全归约模式的资源分配问题，平衡通信成本与迁移开销。

Method: 将问题建模为具有受限状态空间的度量任务系统，通过限制割边数量（最多2k）将状态空间从指数级降至多项式级（n^O(k)），并证明此限制仅增加O(k)倍成本。

Result: 提出的随机算法在允许集群大小不超过(3/4 + ε)·n的条件下，实现了O(ε⁻³·log²n)的竞争比。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种随机算法，用于解决环形网络中的在线二分问题，通过资源增强实现了O(ε⁻³·log²n)的竞争比，显著优于现有确定性算法。

Abstract: The online bisection problem requires maintaining a dynamic partition of $n$ nodes into two equal-sized clusters. Requests arrive sequentially as node pairs. If the nodes lie in different clusters, the algorithm pays unit cost. After each request, the algorithm may migrate nodes between clusters at unit cost per node. This problem models datacenter resource allocation where virtual machines must be assigned to servers, balancing communication costs against migration overhead.
  We study the variant where requests are restricted to edges of a ring network, an abstraction of ring-allreduce patterns in distributed machine learning. Despite this restriction, the problem remains challenging with an $Ω(n)$ deterministic lower bound. We present a randomized algorithm achieving $O(\varepsilon^{-3} \cdot \log^2 n)$ competitive ratio using resource augmentation that allows clusters of size at most $(3/4 + \varepsilon) \cdot n$.
  Our approach formulates the problem as a metrical task system with a restricted state space. By limiting the number of cut-edges (i.e., ring edges between clusters) to at most $2k$, where $k = Θ(1/\varepsilon)$, we reduce the state space from exponential to polynomial (i.e., $n^{O(k)}$). The key technical contribution is proving that this restriction increases cost by only a factor of $O(k)$. Our algorithm follows by applying the randomized MTS solution of Bubeck et al. [SODA 2019].
  The best result to date for bisection with ring demands is the $O(n \cdot \log n)$-competitive deterministic online algorithm of Rajaraman and Wasim [ESA 2024] for the general setting. While prior work for ring-demands by Räcke et al. [SPAA 2023] achieved $O(\log^3 n)$ for multiple clusters, their approach employs a resource augmentation factor of $2+\varepsilon$, making it inapplicable to bisection.

Motivation: 现有方法在差分隐私持续发布中需要较高的加性误差，且空间需求大。论文旨在通过引入乘性误差来降低加性误差，并减少空间复杂度。

Method: 论文采用差分隐私技术，设计了一种算法，用于持续发布流中不同元素的数量和$F_2$矩的估计，结合加性和乘性误差。

Result: 提出的算法在持续发布不同元素数量和$F_2$矩时，实现了$	ext{polylog}(T)$的加性和乘性误差，且仅需$	ext{polylog}(T)$空间。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在差分隐私持续发布中结合加性和乘性误差的新方法，显著降低了误差并减少了空间需求，同时提出了多个开放性问题以进一步探索误差权衡。

Abstract: We study differentially private continual release of the number of distinct items in a turnstile stream, where items may be both inserted and deleted. A recent work of Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith (NeurIPS '23) shows that for streams of length $T$, polynomial additive error of $Ω(T^{1/4})$ is necessary, even without any space restrictions. We show that this additive error lower bound can be circumvented if the algorithm is allowed to output estimates with both additive \emph{and multiplicative} error. We give an algorithm for the continual release of the number of distinct elements with $\text{polylog} (T)$ multiplicative and $\text{polylog}(T)$ additive error. We also show a qualitatively similar phenomenon for estimating the $F_2$ moment of a turnstile stream, where we can obtain $1+o(1)$ multiplicative and $\text{polylog} (T)$ additive error. Both results can be achieved using polylogarithmic space whereas prior approaches use polynomial space. In the sublinear space regime, some multiplicative error is necessary even if privacy is not a consideration. We raise several open questions aimed at better understanding trade-offs between multiplicative and additive error in private continual release.

Motivation: 研究PCSP的鲁棒可满足性，特别是针对1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT和布尔PCSP，以理解不同多态性下的性能差异。

Method: 开发了一种相关且鲁棒的SDP舍入算法，扩展了Brown-Cohen和Raghavendra的方法。

Result: 在UGC下，1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT问题存在指数级损失；提出了一种算法，在多数多态性下实现最优权衡。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在Unique Games猜想下，1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT问题的鲁棒可满足性存在指数级损失，并提出了适用于多数多态性的算法，显著推广了Charikar-Makarychev-Makarychev算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of robust satisfiability of promise CSPs (PCSPs), initiated in (Brakensiek, Guruswami, Sandeep, STOC 2023 / Discrete Analysis 2025), and obtain the following results:
  For the PCSP 1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT with negations, we prove that it is hard, under the Unique Games conjecture (UGC), to satisfy $1-Ω(1/\log (1/ε))$ constraints in a $(1-ε)$-satisfiable instance. This shows that the exponential loss incurred by the BGS algorithm for the case of Alternating-Threshold polymorphisms is necessary, in contrast to the polynomial loss achievable for Majority polymorphisms.
  For any Boolean PCSP that admits Majority polymorphisms, we give an algorithm satisfying $1-O(\sqrtε)$ fraction of the weaker constraints when promised the existence of an assignment satisfying $1-ε$ fraction of the stronger constraints. This significantly generalizes the Charikar--Makarychev--Makarychev algorithm for 2-SAT, and matches the optimal trade-off possible under the UGC. The algorithm also extends, with the loss of an extra $\log (1/ε)$ factor, to PCSPs on larger domains with a certain structural condition, which is implied by, e.g., a family of Plurality polymorphisms.
  We prove that assuming the UGC, robust satisfiability is preserved under the addition of equality constraints. As a consequence, we can extend the rich algebraic techniques for decision/search PCSPs to robust PCSPs. The methods involve the development of a correlated and robust version of the general SDP rounding algorithm for CSPs due to (Brown-Cohen, Raghavendra, ICALP 2016), which might be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 本文通过引入认证捷径这一新概念和技术工具，简化并强化了现有不可能性结果，证明了任何近线性时间的基于捷径的算法无法将图的直径降低到$n^{1/4-o(1)}$以下，这是当前技术下可能的最佳界限。

Abstract: All parallel algorithms for directed connectivity and shortest paths crucially rely on efficient shortcut constructions that add a linear number of transitive closure edges to a given DAG to reduce its diameter. A long sequence of works has studied both (efficient) shortcut constructions and impossibility results on the best diameter and therefore the best parallelism that can be achieved with this approach.
  This paper introduces a new conceptual and technical tool, called certified shortcuts, for this line of research in the form of a simple and natural structural criterion that holds for any shortcut constructed by an efficient (combinatorial) algorithm. It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques.
  Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms. We believe our new criterion and perspective of looking for certified shortcuts can provide crucial guidance for designing efficient shortcut constructions in the future.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对超图中最大独立集问题的预处理方法，通过九种新的数据缩减规则显著减少了实例大小，并提高了后续求解器的运行效率。

Abstract: This work addresses the well-known Maximum Independent Set problem in the context of hypergraphs. While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x. Additionally, one more instance becomes solvable by a method when combined with our preprocessing.

Motivation: 研究无向图中个性化PageRank估计的紧界，填补现有研究在无向图领域的空白，并利用无向图的额外结构优化算法。

Method: 研究了无向图中个性化PageRank（PPR）估计的时间复杂度，考虑了常见的图访问模型，并探讨了单源、单目标和单节点（PageRank中心性）变体。

Result: 提供了无向图中PPR估计的完整表征，给出了所有问题和模型变体的紧界（最多对数因子），包括新的上界和下界。

Conclusion: 该论文通过开发新技术，解决了无向图中个性化PageRank估计的问题，给出了所有问题和模型变体的紧界（最多对数因子），填补了无向图领域的空白。

Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, the Personalized PageRank (PPR) of $t\in V$ with respect to $s\in V$, denoted $π(s,t)$, is the probability that an $α$-discounted random walk starting at $s$ terminates at $t$. We study the time complexity of estimating $π(s,t)$ with constant relative error and constant failure probability, whenever $π(s,t)$ is above a given threshold parameter $δ\in(0,1)$. We consider common graph-access models and furthermore study the single source, single target, and single node (PageRank centrality) variants of the problem.
  We provide a complete characterization of PPR estimation in undirected graphs by giving tight bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for all problems and model variants in both the worst-case and average-case setting. This includes both new upper and lower bounds.
  Tight bounds were recently obtained by Bertram, Jensen, Thorup, Wang, and Yan for directed graphs. However, their lower bound constructions rely on asymmetry and therefore do not carry over to undirected graphs. At the same time, undirected graphs exhibit additional structure that can be exploited algorithmically. Our results resolve the undirected case by developing new techniques that capture both aspects, yielding tight bounds.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语法压缩字符串的随机访问问题，提出了一种优化查询时间与数据结构大小的通用权衡方案，并证明了其紧致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索在压缩字符串上实现更小数据结构的同时保持高效查询的可能性，特别是在语法压缩设置下。

Method: 通过新颖的语法转换技术，构建了一个支持高效确定性构造的数据结构，该结构不仅支持随机访问，还支持子串提取、rank和select操作。

Result: 研究结果表明，对于任何满足特定条件的M，可以构建一个O(M)大小的数据结构，其查询时间为O(frac{log(nlogσ/Mw)}{log(Mw/glog n)})，并且证明了在所有相关参数范围内几乎都是紧致的。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种在语法压缩字符串上的随机访问查询的通用权衡方案，优化了查询时间与数据结构大小之间的关系，并在几乎所有参数范围内实现了紧致的上下界。

Abstract: A Random Access query to a string $T\in [0..σ)^n$ asks for the character $T[i]$ at a given position $i\in [0..n)$. In $O(n\logσ)$ bits of space, this fundamental task admits constant-time queries. While this is optimal in the worst case, much research has focused on compressible strings, hoping for smaller data structures that still admit efficient queries.
  We investigate the grammar-compressed setting, where $T$ is represented by a straight-line grammar. Our main result is a general trade-off that optimizes Random Access time as a function of string length $n$, grammar size (the total length of productions) $g$, alphabet size $σ$, data structure size $M$, and word size $w=Ω(\log n)$ of the word RAM model. For any $M$ with $g\log n<Mw<n\logσ$, we show an $O(M)$-size data structure with query time $O(\frac{\log(n\logσ\,/\,Mw)}{\log(Mw\,/\,g\log n)})$. Remarkably, we also prove a matching unconditional lower bound that holds for all parameter regimes except very small grammars and relatively small data structures.
  Previous work focused on query time as a function of $n$ only, achieving $O(\log n)$ time using $O(g)$ space [Bille et al.; SIAM J. Comput. 2015] and $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ time using $O(g\log^ε n)$ space for any constant $ε> 0$ [Belazzougui et al.; ESA'15], [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey; J. ACM 2021]. The only tight lower bound [Verbin and Yu; CPM'13] was $Ω(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ for $w=Θ(\log n)$, $n^{Ω(1)}\le g\le n^{1-Ω(1)}$, and $M=g\log^{Θ(1)}n$. In contrast, our result yields tight bounds in all relevant parameters and almost all regimes.
  Our data structure admits efficient deterministic construction. It relies on novel grammar transformations that generalize contracting grammars [Ganardi; ESA'21]. Beyond Random Access, its variants support substring extraction, rank, and select.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过长度截断优化move结构的方法，显著提升了查询效率和空间利用率，适用于基因组学等领域的压缩文本索引。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: move结构在压缩文本索引中具有重要应用，尤其在基因组学中。虽然已有方法在理论和实践中表现良好，但仍有优化空间，尤其是在构造时间和查询效率方面。

Method: 采用长度截断策略（length capping），通过截断长区间来优化move结构的查询时间，同时改进了构造时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 提出的方法将move结构的空间复杂度优化至$O(r \log r + r \log \frac{n}{r})$位，查询时间改进为$O(\log \frac{n}{r})$，并在实验中实现了至少40%的空间节省。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种更简单的长度截断方法，优化了move结构的平均查询时间，并在理论和实践中均显示出显著优势。通过RunPerm库的实验验证，该方法不仅提高了查询速度，还显著减少了空间占用。

Abstract: The move structure represents permutations with long contiguously permuted intervals in compressed space with optimal query time. They have become an important feature of compressed text indexes using space proportional to the number of Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) runs, often applied in genomics. This is in thanks not only to theoretical improvements over past approaches, but great cache efficiency and average case query time in practice. This is true even without using the worst case guarantees provided by the interval splitting balancing of the original result. In this paper, we show that an even simpler type of splitting, length capping by truncating long intervals, bounds the average move structure query time to optimal whilst obtaining a superior construction time than the traditional approach. This also proves constant query time when amortized over a full traversal of a single cycle permutation from an arbitrary starting position.
  Such a scheme has surprising benefits both in theory and practice. We leverage the approach to improve the representation of any move structure with $r$ runs over a domain $n$ to $O(r \log r + r \log \frac{n}{r})$-bits of space. The worst case query time is also improved to $O(\log \frac{n}{r})$ without balancing. An $O(r)$-time and $O(r)$-space construction lets us apply the method to run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) permutations such as LF and $φ$ to obtain optimal-time algorithms for BWT inversion and suffix array (SA) enumeration in $O(r)$ additional working space. Finally, we provide the RunPerm library, providing flexible plug and play move structure support, and use it to evaluate our splitting approach. Experiments find length capping results in faster move structures, but also a space reduction: at least $\sim 40\%$ for LF across large repetitive genomic collections.

Conclusion: 该系统通过创新的模拟、表示和优化方法，成功实现了对辐射压力影响下的参数化设计的高效优化，为航天器设计等领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a system to optimize parametric designs subject to radiation pressure, \ie the effect of light on the motion of objects. This is most relevant in the design of spacecraft, where radiation pressure presents the dominant non-conservative forcing mechanism, which is the case beyond approximately 800 km altitude. Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的非确定性行为使得传统静态审计方法失效，现有安全方法无法提供足够的透明性或可追溯性。

Method: 引入了AgentTrace框架，在运行时以最小开销对代理进行检测，捕获操作、认知和上下文三个层面的结构化日志流。

Conclusion: AgentTrace通过动态可观测性和遥测框架，为LLM代理的安全、问责和实时监控提供了基础层，解决了敏感环境中使用LLM代理的关键问题。

Abstract: Despite the growing capabilities of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs), their adoption in high-stakes domains remains limited. A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring. Our research highlights how AgentTrace can enable more reliable agent deployment, fine-grained risk analysis, and informed trust calibration, thereby addressing critical concerns that have so far limited the use of LLM agents in sensitive environments.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能通过标准化规范可靠地实现基于代理的模型，以支持复制、验证和验证。

Method: 通过分阶段的可执行性检查、与已验证NetLogo基线的模型无关统计比较，以及运行时效率和可维护性的定量测量，评估了17种当代LLMs在ODD-to-code翻译任务中的表现。

Result: 行为上忠实的实现是可实现的但并非保证，仅可执行性不足以满足科学用途。GPT-4.1始终产生统计上有效且高效的实现，Claude 3.7 Sonnet表现良好但可靠性较低。

Conclusion: 研究明确了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为模型工程工具的潜力与当前局限性，对可复现的基于代理和环境建模具有启示意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now synthesize non-trivial executable code from textual descriptions, raising an important question: can LLMs reliably implement agent-based models from standardized specifications in a way that supports replication, verification, and validation? We address this question by evaluating 17 contemporary LLMs on a controlled ODD-to-code translation task, using the PPHPC predator-prey model as a fully specified reference. Generated Python implementations are assessed through staged executability checks, model-independent statistical comparison against a validated NetLogo baseline, and quantitative measures of runtime efficiency and maintainability. Results show that behaviorally faithful implementations are achievable but not guaranteed, and that executability alone is insufficient for scientific use. GPT-4.1 consistently produces statistically valid and efficient implementations, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet performing well but less reliably. Overall, the findings clarify both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as model engineering tools, with implications for reproducible agent-based and environmental modelling.

Conclusion: 本文总结了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行系统映射研究的实际经验，提供了实用建议，强调了效率提升和方法论风险。

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn growing interest within the scientific community. LLMs can handle large volumes of textual data and support methods for evidence synthesis. Although recent studies highlight the potential of LLMs to accelerate screening and data extraction steps in systematic reviews, detailed reports of their practical application throughout the entire process remain scarce. This paper presents an experience report on the conduction of a systematic mapping study with the support of LLMs, describing the steps followed, the necessary adjustments, and the main challenges faced. Positive aspects are discussed, such as (i) the significant reduction of time in repetitive tasks and (ii) greater standardization in data extraction, as well as negative aspects, including (i) considerable effort to build reliable well-structured prompts, especially for less experienced users, since achieving effective prompts may require several iterations and testing, which can partially offset the expected time savings, (ii) the occurrence of hallucinations, and (iii) the need for constant manual verification. As a contribution, this work offers lessons learned and practical recommendations for researchers interested in adopting LLMs in systematic mappings and reviews, highlighting both efficiency gains and methodological risks and limitations to be considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码基准主要关注静态正确性，未捕捉推理时的自进化能力，且缺乏对人类性能的校准和跨语言稳定性的探索。

Method: 提出了EvoCodeBench基准，用于评估自进化的LLM驱动编码系统，并直接与人类性能进行比较。

Result: 自进化系统在效率上随时间有显著提升，人类相对和多语言分析提供了仅靠准确性无法获得的洞察。

Conclusion: EvoCodeBench为评估自进化的LLM驱动编码系统提供了基础，展示了其在效率和跨语言分析方面的优势。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in programming tasks, LLM-driven coding systems have evolved from one-shot code generation into complex systems capable of iterative improvement during inference. However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone. EvoCodeBench establishes a foundation for evaluating coding intelligence in evolving LLM-driven systems.

TL;DR: 研究提出TestExplora基准，评估LLMs作为主动测试者的能力，发现当前模型在主动缺陷发现方面表现有限（最大F2P率16.06%），但代理探索（如SWEAgent）能有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法忽视了软件保证的第三个目标——主动发现缺陷，通常仅关注回归预防或缺陷重现。为填补这一空白，研究旨在评估LLMs作为主动测试者的能力。

Method: 提出了TestExplora基准，用于评估LLMs在完整、现实的仓库环境中作为主动测试者的能力。TestExplora包含来自482个仓库的2,389个任务，隐藏所有缺陷相关信号，要求模型通过比较实现与文档衍生的意图来主动发现缺陷。

Result: 评估显示，最先进模型的最大F2P率仅为16.06%，表明LLMs在主动缺陷发现方面存在显著能力差距。代理探索（如SWEAgent）能提升性能，F2P达17.27%，F2P@5为29.7%。

Conclusion: 研究发现，当前最先进的LLMs在主动发现缺陷方面的能力存在显著差距，最大Fail-to-Pass (F2P)率仅为16.06%。通过代理探索（如SWEAgent）可以提升性能，F2P达到17.27%，F2P@5为29.7%，展示了代理探索在主动缺陷发现任务中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to automate software development, comprehensive software assurance spans three distinct goals: regression prevention, reactive reproduction, and proactive discovery. Current evaluations systematically overlook the third goal. Specifically, they either treat existing code as ground truth (a compliance trap) for regression prevention, or depend on post-failure artifacts (e.g., issue reports) for bug reproduction-so they rarely surface defects before failures. To bridge this gap, we present TestExplora, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs as proactive testers within full-scale, realistic repository environments. TestExplora contains 2,389 tasks from 482 repositories and hides all defect-related signals. Models must proactively find bugs by comparing implementations against documentation-derived intent, using documentation as the oracle. Furthermore, to keep evaluation sustainable and reduce leakage, we propose continuous, time-aware data collection. Our evaluation reveals a significant capability gap: state-of-the-art models achieve a maximum Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rate of only 16.06%. Further analysis indicates that navigating complex cross-module interactions and leveraging agentic exploration are critical to advancing LLMs toward autonomous software quality assurance. Consistent with this, SWEAgent instantiated with GPT-5-mini achieves an F2P of 17.27% and an F2P@5 of 29.7%, highlighting the effectiveness and promise of agentic exploration in proactive bug discovery tasks.

Abstract: Agentic AI denotes an architectural transition from stateless, prompt-driven generative models toward goal-directed systems capable of autonomous perception, planning, action, and adaptation through iterative control loops. This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy. The persistent challenges related to verifiability, interoperability, and safe autonomy remain key areas for future research and practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces a Theory of Troubleshooting that is rooted in cognitive science. This theory helps software developers explain the challenges they face and the project risks that emerge as troubleshooting becomes difficult. We define troubleshooting as the cognitive problem-solving process of identifying, understanding, and constructing a mental model of the cause of an unexpected system behavior, and consider the cognitive process of troubleshooting to be an integral part of the activity of debugging. Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data. Our theory contributes to research on Developer Experience by providing a cognitive foundation for understanding troubleshooting difficulty, fatigue, and sustainability risk--and offers practical implications for both research and industry.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown promising potential in automating Instructional Systems Design (ISD), a systematic approach to developing educational programs. However, evaluating these agents remains challenging due to the lack of standardized benchmarks and the risk of LLM-as-judge bias. We present ISD-Agent-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 25,795 scenarios generated via a Context Matrix framework that combines 51 contextual variables across 5 categories with 33 ISD sub-steps derived from the ADDIE model. To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches. Further analysis reveals that theoretical quality strongly correlates with benchmark performance, with theory-based agents showing significant advantages in problem-centered design and objective-assessment alignment. Our work provides a foundation for systematic LLM-based ISD research.

TL;DR: VLMs offer potential for AUR perception modules but need empirical evaluation to assess performance and uncertainty in underwater trash detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address the challenges of developing trustworthy perception modules for AURs in harsh underwater conditions, where labeled data is scarce and noisy.

Method: The paper conducts an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules, assessing their performance and uncertainty in detecting underwater trash.

Result: The evaluation provides insights into the performance and uncertainty of VLMs in underwater environments, aiding software engineers in selecting suitable models for AUR software.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for enhancing perception modules in Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs), particularly in detecting underwater trash, but their performance and uncertainty require careful evaluation to ensure trustworthy software.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Robots (AURs) operate in challenging underwater environments, including low visibility and harsh water conditions. Such conditions present challenges for software engineers developing perception modules for the AUR software. To successfully carry out these tasks, deep learning has been incorporated into the AUR software to support its operations. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software.

Conclusion: 论文提出了LiAgent框架，用于生态系统级别的许可证兼容性分析，并提供了支持LLMware生态系统可持续发展的建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software systems, giving rise to a new class of systems referred to as LLMware. Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem.

Motivation: 现有漏洞检测方法多集中于二元评估，且解释与CWE类别语义一致性不足，VulReaD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VulReaD利用安全知识图谱作为语义骨干，结合强教师LLM生成CWE一致的对比推理监督，并通过ORPO优化学生模型训练。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，VulReaD在二元F1上提升8-10%，多类分类上提升30% Macro-F1和18% Micro-F1。

Conclusion: VulReaD通过知识图谱引导的漏洞推理和检测方法，显著提升了漏洞检测的准确性和解释性，尤其在CWE级别的分类上表现优异。

Abstract: Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有研究多仅以可靠性为比较指标且仅选择少数LLM（如Codex和ChatGPT），缺乏全面性。PELLI旨在提供全面的代码质量评估框架，促进LLM与人类开发者的协同。

Method: 提出了一种名为PELLI的迭代分析框架，通过定量指标评估五项流行LLM在三个应用领域的表现，遵循Python编码标准。

Result: GPT-4T和Gemini在非功能性需求上表现较好；提示设计影响代码质量；不同应用领域在不同指标上表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 基于三项非功能性需求（可维护性、性能和可靠性），GPT-4T和Gemini表现略优。提示设计对代码质量有显著影响，不同应用领域在不同指标上表现不一。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that when LLMs are appropriately prompted and configured, they demonstrate mixed results. Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts.

Abstract: In large scale agile systems development, the lack of a unified requirements engineering (RE) process is a major challenge, exacerbated by the absence of high level guiding principles for effective requirements management. To address this challenge, we conducted a five year longitudinal case study with Grundfos AB, in collaboration with the Software Centre in Sweden. RE principles were first derived through qualitative data collection spanning more than 25 sprints, approximately 320 weekly synchronisation meetings, and seven cross-company, company-specific workshops between 2019 and 2024. These activities engaged practitioners from diverse roles, representing several hundred developers across domains. In late 2024, five in depth focus groups with senior leaders at Grundfos provided retrospective validation of the principles and assessed their strategic impact. We aim to (1) empirically examine RE principles in large scale agile system development, (2) explore their benefits in practice within the case company, and (3) identify a set of transferable RE principles for large scale contexts. Using thematic analysis, six key RE principles architectural context, stakeholder-driven validation and alignment, requirements practices in large-scale agile organisations. evolution with lightweight documentation, delegated requirements management, organisational roles and responsibilities, and a shared understanding of requirements are derived. The study was further validated through crosscompany expert evaluation with three additional multinational organisations (Bosch, Ericsson, and Volvo Cars), which are directly responsible for largescale requirements management. Together, these efforts provide a scalable and adaptable foundation for improving requirements practices in largescale agile organisations.

Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reasoning about interactions with surrounding traffic. A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

Abstract: This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in legged locomotion learning are still dominated by the utilization of geometric representations of the environment, limiting the robot's capability to respond to higher-level semantics such as human instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates high-level commonsense reasoning from foundation models into the process of legged locomotion adaptation. Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出LifeLong-RFT强化微调策略，通过多维奖励机制提升VLA模型的多任务和持续学习能力，性能显著优于SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监督微调（SFT）在适应下游领域时需要大量任务特定数据且易导致灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 结合块级策略强化学习和多维过程奖励机制（MDPR），包括量化动作一致性奖励（QACR）、连续轨迹对齐奖励（CTAR）和格式合规奖励（FCR）。

Result: 在SimplerEnv、LIBERO和真实任务中表现优异，持续学习任务中平均成功率比SFT提高22%，仅需20%的训练数据即可适应新任务。

Conclusion: LifeLong-RFT作为一种后训练范式，为VLA模型提供了简单而有效的强化微调策略，显著提升了多任务学习和持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained on large-scale and diverse datasets, VLA models demonstrate strong generalization and adaptability as general-purpose robotic policies. However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs.

Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\% with only a 5.3\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline. These results highlight the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms.

Conclusion: LAP-3B 是首个无需特定机器人微调即可实现零样本迁移的视觉-语言-动作模型，在多个新机器人和操作任务中平均成功率超过50%，性能提升约2倍。

Abstract: A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.

TL;DR: A closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, featuring a hierarchical planner and GPU-accelerated MPPI controller, achieves robust planning and real-time control at 50 Hz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration and enable real-time, configuration-agnostic motion control for dynamically assembled robots.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical planner with a high-level bidirectional heuristic search and a low-level A* search, alongside a GPU-accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller for adaptive motion generation.

Result: Simulations show the type-penalty term enhances planning robustness, the greedy heuristic reduces physical execution costs, and the annealing-variance MPPI outperforms standard MPPI in control accuracy and frequency (50 Hz).

Conclusion: The framework successfully validates the full-cycle process of module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation, demonstrating robustness and efficiency in heterogeneous modular robot automation.

Abstract: This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

Abstract: Magnetically actuated capsule robots promise minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but existing systems largely neglect control of capsule pitch, a degree of freedom critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls. This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.

Abstract: Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.

Result: 实验验证了GuadalPlanner在完全仿真环境、软件在环配置和实际自主车辆中的一致性部署能力，包括在水质监测自主水面车辆上的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的统一架构GuadalPlanner通过标准化接口解决了自主车辆路径规划算法在仿真与真实部署间的迁移性问题，验证了其在不同抽象级别和实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型无人机设计和接触检测方法，通过物理交互盲推断屋顶倾斜度，实验证明其能在高倾斜度表面上实现稳健着陆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉或声学的传感方法在检测屋顶倾斜度时受外部因素影响较大，导致测量不可靠。

Method: 开发了一种基于动量扭矩观测器的本体感知接触检测和定位策略，使无人机能够通过物理交互盲推断倾斜表面的角度。

Result: 在飞行实验中，无人机成功在倾斜度高达30.5度的表面上着陆，并在9次不同倾斜角度的实验中平均倾斜度估计误差为2.87度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型无人机形态和接触检测策略，成功实现了在倾斜屋顶上的稳健着陆，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人操作系统缺乏预测能力，导致错误和效率低下，而现有的视觉语言模型和世界模型无法明确预测未来状态或仅能预测短时间范围。

Method: 首先选择并调整稳健的视频生成模型以确保可靠的未来预测，然后应用对抗蒸馏进行快速、少步骤的视频生成，最后训练一个动作模型，利用生成的视频和真实观察来纠正空间错误。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合视频生成模型和对抗蒸馏技术，显著提升了机器人操作的预测能力和效率，实现了更高的空间一致性和任务完成率。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.

Motivation: 研究VLA驾驶系统在传统视觉规划基础上的独特优势，尤其是在长尾场景中的行为差异。

Method: 通过3-RQ分析，比较VLM与视觉主干在相同扩散Transformer规划器下的表现，并提出混合与双策略系统。

Result: VLM在某些场景中表现更激进，ViT更保守；HybridDriveVLA将PDMS提升至92.10；DualDriveVLA在15%场景调用VLM，实现91.00 PDMS和3.2倍吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: VLA系统在特定场景中具有优势，混合与双策略设计能有效平衡性能与效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.

This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety and adaptability.

Motivation: 旨在探索便携式社交机器人Maya在儿童癌症治疗中的潜在作用，以减轻治疗过程中的疼痛和焦虑。

Method: 研究通过深度神经网络提升了机器人面部表情识别的准确性（98%），并设计了两项初步探索性实验：一项比较注射过程中儿童疼痛水平，另一项评估儿童及母亲与机器人互动时的视角。

Result: 实验结果显示，机器人的存在显著降低了儿童注射时的疼痛感知（配对T检验显著），且儿童在与机器人互动中表现出比父母更低的焦虑和更高的信任水平（P值<0.05）。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了Maya机器人作为临床治疗/教育助手的积极影响，尤其在儿童癌症治疗中改善了疼痛管理和情绪健康。

Abstract: This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

Conclusion: 研究通过深度学习模型成功预测了人类在不同社交情境下的注视方向，并将最佳模型应用于Nao机器人，获得了参与者的积极评价，尤其是在有机器人经验的群体中表现更佳。

Abstract: During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.

Motivation: 标准几何控制依赖力-力矩解耦假设，但在许多空中平台中，这一假设因控制力矩自然诱导的虚假力而失效。目前缺乏对这些耦合系统稳定性的严格理论认证。

Method: 引入了一个规范模型，并构建了基于Lyapunov的证明方法。

Result: 分析解决了结构挑战（特别是诱导的非最小相位行为），这些挑战阻碍了标准级联论证的应用。

Conclusion: 本文填补了理论空白，首次为受虚假力影响的一类浮动刚体系统提供了正式的稳定性分析，证明了悬停平衡点的局部指数稳定性。

Abstract: Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, an assumption that breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces naturally induced by control moments. While strategies for such coupled systems have been validated experimentally, a rigorous theoretical certification of their stability is currently missing. This work fills this gap by providing the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces. We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments.

TL;DR: RADAR是一个新基准，用于在真实条件下系统评估VLA模型的泛化能力，揭示现有模型在物理动态和空间推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型的评估主要局限于模拟或高度受限的真实世界设置，导致现实差距，现有基准存在三个系统性缺陷。

Method: RADAR集成了三个核心组件：一套原则性的物理动态套件、专门测试空间推理和物理理解的任务，以及基于3D指标的完全自主评估流程。

Result: 应用RADAR评估多个最先进的VLA模型，发现其在物理动态下的严重脆弱性，3D IoU从0.261降至0.068。

Conclusion: RADAR被定位为一个必要的基准，用于可靠且可泛化的VLA模型真实世界评估。

Abstract: VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的分层Vision-Language-Action框架（VISTA）通过结合预训练的世界模型和视觉子任务分解，显著提升了在分布外（OOD）场景下的泛化能力，性能提升显著。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: GEAR框架通过利用MAV动力学的SO(2)旋转对称性，显著提高了多任务强化学习的数据效率和泛化能力，实现了多种特技动作的高成功率执行。

Abstract: Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于超二次曲面（SQ）的安全过滤框架，通过使用符号距离函数（SDF）作为屏障候选，解决了现有方法中隐式SQ函数梯度条件差的问题，从而实现了在复杂和动态环境中的可靠实时安全过滤。

Abstract: Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments.

Abstract: Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures.

To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.

Abstract: Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决腿式机器人在复杂场景（如狭窄通道、大间隙跨越等）中的运动规划问题，克服现有方法在多阶段处理、局部极小值问题上的不足。

Method: 采用基于二次规划的姿势生成器和后退视野多接触运动规划方法，同时规划接触位置和全身轨迹。

Result: 短规划视野下规划速度比现有技术快45%至98%，长规划视野下运动质量提升（减少8%至47%的站姿变化）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型的腿式机器人多接触运动规划器，能够在短规划视野下显著提高规划速度，并在长规划视野下提升运动质量。

Abstract: We present a novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging scenarios, able to plan motions such as chimney climbing, navigating very narrow passages or crossing large gaps. Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).

Motivation: 解决分层目标条件强化学习（H-GCRL）在离线或数据稀缺场景中数据效率低和策略表达能力有限的问题。

Method: 引入了基于归一化流的分层隐式Q学习（NF-HIQL），用表达性强的归一化流策略替换了传统的高斯策略，支持可处理的似然计算、高效采样和多模态行为建模。

Result: 在多种长视野任务（如运动、运球和多步操作）中，NF-HIQL均优于现有目标条件和分层基线方法。

Conclusion: NF-HIQL展示了基于流的架构在可扩展、数据高效的分层强化学习中的潜力，并在有限数据下表现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 解决当前DRL训练范式在高平台遍历中常导致高冲击、扭矩受限且不安全的跳跃式解决方案的问题。

Method: 提出APEX系统，结合地形条件行为（如攀爬、行走、姿势调整）和广义棘轮进度奖励，训练基于LiDAR的全身操纵策略，并通过双重策略减少模拟到现实的感知差距。

Result: 实验证明，APEX能在29-DoF Unitree G1人形机器人上实现零射击模拟到现实的高平台遍历，适应不同平台高度和初始姿势，并实现平滑的多技能过渡。

Conclusion: APEX系统通过结合多种地形条件行为，成功实现了人形机器人在高平台上的零射击模拟到现实遍历，展示了在0.8米平台（约114%腿长）上的稳健适应性。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation. Overall, YOR offers competitive functionality for mobile manipulation research at a fraction of the cost of existing platforms. Project website: https://www.yourownrobot.ai/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地应用于社会和战略场景，理解其行为与人类行为的分歧点及原因变得至关重要。

Method: 采用AlphaEvolve这一前沿程序发现工具，直接从数据中发现人类和LLMs行为的可解释模型。

Result: 研究发现，前沿LLMs在迭代的石头剪刀布游戏中展现出比人类更深的战略行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）在战略互动中行为差异的结构性因素奠定了基础。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.

Motivation: 现有医学基准测试存在数据污染和时间错位问题，且评估指标不足以验证临床正确性，亟需一个更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 引入 LiveMedBench，一个基于真实世界临床案例的基准测试，采用多智能体临床筛选框架过滤数据噪声，并使用自动化评分评估框架分解医生回答为细粒度标准。

Result: LiveMedBench 包含 2,756 个真实案例和 16,702 个评估标准。评估显示，最佳模型仅达到 39.2% 的准确率，84% 的模型在截止后案例上表现下降。

Conclusion: LiveMedBench 是一个持续更新、无污染且基于评分的基准测试，能够有效评估大型语言模型在临床环境中的表现。通过多智能体临床筛选框架和自动化评分评估框架，LiveMedBench 显著提升了评估的准确性和临床相关性。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

Conclusion: Found-RL平台通过异步批量推理框架和多样化的监督机制，成功地将基础模型高效集成到强化学习中，实现了轻量级RL模型接近十亿参数VLM的性能，并保持了实时推理能力（约500 FPS）。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.

Result: 实证结果表明，基线LLM策略常偏离人类偏好，而提出的机制显著提升了谈判性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架显著提升了LLM在谈判中的表现，使其策略行为更具深度和对对手的感知能力。

Abstract: Bargaining is often regarded as a logical arena rather than an art or a matter of intuition, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to navigate it due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors. Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.

Conclusion: 在自动化调试的适当指导下，某些大型语言模型（LLMs）能够生成有用的定性数值规划（QNP）抽象。

Abstract: Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) serves as an important abstraction model for generalized planning (GP), which aims to compute general plans that solve multiple instances at once. Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于固定词汇表和树状状态空间，缺乏对DAG结构的显式建模，限制了组合路径的探索和泛化能力。

Method: 提出Flow of SpanS (FOSS)框架，通过灵活分割检索文本构建动态span词汇表，确保DAG结构状态空间，利用GFlowNets探索多样化组合路径。

Result: FoSS在文本生成任务中MAUVE分数提升12.5%，知识密集型任务中提升3.5%，且在大模型、更多数据和丰富检索语料下表现更优。

Conclusion: FoSS通过构建动态span词汇表和DAG结构状态空间，显著提升了文本生成的多样性和质量，并在知识密集型任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.

Conclusion: NSAM框架通过自动学习符号模型并整合符号推理与深度策略优化，显著提高了DRL的样本效率，同时大幅减少了约束违规。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may explore infeasible actions during training and execution. Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.

TL;DR: LRMs excel in formal reasoning but fail to consistently outperform non-reasoning models in ToM tasks, revealing issues like slow thinking collapse and option matching shortcuts, necessitating unique capabilities for robust ToM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether the benefits of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) in step-by-step inference for mathematics and coding extend to socio-cognitive skills, specifically Theory of Mind (ToM), which is crucial for natural social interaction.

Method: The research systematically compares nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), differentiating reasoning models from non-reasoning models across three ToM benchmarks, and includes fine-grained analysis and intervention approaches like Slow-to-Fast (S2F) and Think-to-Match (T2M).

Result: Findings indicate that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models in ToM tasks, with performance sometimes worse. Key insights include the collapse of slow thinking, benefits of moderate and adaptive reasoning, and reliance on option matching shortcuts.

Conclusion: The study concludes that robust Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities require unique developments beyond current reasoning methods, as advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for formal reasoning do not fully transfer to socio-cognitive tasks like ToM.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

Motivation: 现有方法通常孤立建模人类行为维度，导致训练成本高且泛化能力有限，需解决异构行为数据的学习问题。

Method: 提出了Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO)，通过调节优势函数平衡异构任务和样本的学习。

Conclusion: HARPO方法在跨行为任务中表现最为稳定，显著提升了Omnisapiens-7B 2.0模型的多任务和未知任务性能。

Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.

Conclusion: V-STAR框架通过VED和Sibling-GRPO组件有效解决了RL在生成推荐中的概率-奖励不匹配问题，显著提升了模型性能和多样性。

Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

Motivation: 高等教育中GenAI的应用日益广泛，但利益相关者的看法存在分歧，且需遵守欧盟AI法案，因此需要研究如何根据学科特点整合GenAI。

Method: 采用混合方法，调查了奥卢大学ITEE学院的61名教职工和37名学生。

Result: 研究揭示了共享和学科特定的主题，如对编程支持的强烈兴趣以及对响应质量、隐私和学术诚信的担忧。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个概念框架和高层次要求，为高校在整合GenAI时提供实践指导，同时解决利益相关者的担忧并确保合规性。

Abstract: Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Method: 通过 ScratchWorld 基准测试，结合原始模式和复合模式两种交互方式，评估多模态 GUI 代理在 Scratch 中的程序构建能力。

Result: 实验显示，尽管多模态语言模型和 GUI 代理在规划能力上表现良好，但在精细 GUI 操作上仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: ScratchWorld 基准测试揭示了多模态 GUI 代理在精细 GUI 操作上的推理与执行差距，尽管其规划能力较强。

Abstract: Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SynergyKGC显著提升了知识图谱补全的命中率，验证了其在非均匀结构数据中弹性信息整合的优越性。

Conclusion: SynergyKGC通过结合密度依赖的Identity Anchoring策略和Double-tower Coherent Consistency架构，有效解决了知识图谱补全中的结构异构性问题，显著提升了KGC的命中率，为非均匀结构数据中的弹性信息整合提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

Conclusion: RLCER通过自我提出的评分标准，无需人工标注即可提供可靠的CoT监督信号，显著优于结果中心的RLVR方法，并在推理时进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM是否能超越主流文化，与多元文化有意义地对齐，尤其是在文化、传统和创造力紧密交织的领域（如烹饪食谱）。

Method: 通过比较人类和LLM在跨文化内容创作中的行为，分析LLM生成的文化适应性食谱与人类食谱的差异。

Result: LLM无法生成具有文化代表性的适应性食谱，其生成内容的文化差异性与文化距离无关，且在内部模型表示中文化信息保留较弱。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在文化适应性生成方面存在根本性限制，不适合用于文化敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

Conclusion: CLI-Gym 提供了一个可扩展的管道，用于大规模生成环境密集型任务，并通过 LiberCoder 模型展示了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Agentic coding requires agents to effectively interact with runtime environments, e.g., command line interfaces (CLI), so as to complete tasks like resolving dependency issues, fixing system problems, etc. But it remains underexplored how such environment-intensive tasks can be obtained at scale to enhance agents' capabilities. To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: GameDevBench被公开释放以支持进一步的游戏开发代理研究。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

Result: 实验在7个代理模型上进行，结果显示该框架平均比LLM-as-a-Judge基线提高了16.6%，实现了弱到强的泛化（7B法官检测72B代理的欺骗行为准确率超过90%），并通过迭代优化提供了接近线性的安全性提升。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入神经符号框架，成功解决了LLM代理行为安全监督中的关键瓶颈问题，即从自然语言需求到形式化规范的转换。实验验证了该框架在多个基准测试中的优越性能，显著提升了行为安全性和监督准确性。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents increasingly operate in high-stakes domains with real-world consequences, ensuring their behavioral safety becomes paramount. The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据中心网络被单一性能目标所限制，无法满足多样化的工作负载需求，导致性能在不同目标冲突时急剧下降。

Method: DMart 实现了分布式的、每链路、每 RTT 的拍卖机制，避免了复杂的整数线性规划（ILP）、集中式调度器或优先级队列。

Result: DMart 在保持与专用调度器（如 pFabric 和 Sincronia）在其主要目标上相当性能的同时，显著优化了次要目标（如减少截止时间未命中率 2 倍，缩短 coflow 完成时间 1.6 倍）。

Conclusion: DMart 作为一种去中心化的调度框架，通过将网络带宽视为竞争性市场，能够有效支持多样化的性能目标，并在现代数据中心的高规模和低延迟要求下表现出色。

Abstract: Datacenter networks are currently locked in a "tyranny of the single objective". While modern workloads demand diverse performance goals, ranging from coflow completion times, per-flow fairness, short-flow latencies, existing fabrics are typically hardcoded for a single metric. This rigid coupling ensures peak performance when application and network objectives align, but results in abysmal performance when they diverge.
  We propose DMart, a decentralized scheduling framework that treats network bandwidth as a competitive marketplace. In DMart, applications independently encode the urgency and importance of their network traffic into autonomous bids, allowing diverse objectives to co-exist natively on the same fabric. To meet the extreme scale and sub-microsecond requirements of modern datacenters, DMart implements distributed, per-link, per-RTT auctions, without relying on ILPs, centralized schedulers, or complex priority queues.
  We evaluate DMart using packet-level simulations and compare it against network schedulers designed for individual metrics, e.g., pFabric and Sincronia. DMart matches the performance of specialized schedulers on their own "home turf" while simultaneously optimizing secondary metrics. Compared to pFabric and Sincronia, DMart reduces deadline misses by 2x and coflow completion times by 1.6x respectively, while matching pFabric short-flow completion times.

Conclusion: 通过将拓扑序列和流量调度表达为邻接矩阵的和及其幂，本文提出了一种高效构建近最优解的方法，显著降低了全对全通信的完成时间。

Abstract: All-to-all collective communication is a core primitive in distributed machine learning and high-performance computing. At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types.

Abstract: This paper aims to apply two major scaling transformations from the computing packaging industry to internet routers: the heterogeneous integration of high-bandwidth memories (HBMs) and chiplets, as well as in-package optics. We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling.

Conclusion: SplitCom显著降低了联邦学习中LLMs的通信开销，同时保持了模型性能，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of on-device large language models (LLMs) mitigates privacy concerns by preventing raw data sharing. However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\,\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\,\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.

Conclusion: Wormhole显著提升了PLDES的性能，同时保持了高保真度，为大规模模型训练的仿真提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Packet-level discrete-event simulation (PLDES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating detailed performance of large model training. Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.

*Bruno Rodrigues,Karim Khamaisi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究发现，无线传感网络中单个优化链路的性能优于密集部署的多链路网络，避免了多链路融合的噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨密集传感器部署是否真的能提高准确性，以推动无线传感技术在智能基础设施中的商业化应用。

Method: 通过一个12天的自然实验，使用9节点ESP32-C3网格（72个传感链路）在住宅环境中进行测试。

Result: 单个优化放置的链路表现优于72链路的全网格（AUC 0.541 vs. 0.489，Cohen's d=0.86），且随机选择的链路与优化选择的链路表现相当（p=0.35）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在无线传感网络中，单个优化放置的传感器链路比密集部署的传感器网络表现更好，避免了多链路融合带来的噪声干扰。

Abstract: Wireless sensing approaches promise to transform smart infrastructures into privacy-preserving motion detectors, yet commercial adoption remains limited. A common assumption may explain this gap: that denser sensor deployments yield better accuracy. We tested this assumption with a 12-day naturalistic study using a 9-node ESP32-C3 mesh (72 sensing links) in a residential environment. Our results show that a single well-placed link outperformed the full 72-link mesh (AUC 0.541 vs. 0.489, Cohen's $d$=0.86). Even a random link selection matched optimized selection ($p$=0.35). The benefit comes from avoiding multi-link fusion, not from choosing the right link. We attribute this to a "dilution effect": links whose Fresnel zones miss activity regions contribute noise that overwhelms signal from informative links. In our deployment, strategic link placement mattered 2.7$\times$ more than classifier choice. We release 312 hours of labeled CSI data, firmware, and analysis code to enable validation across diverse environments.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个主权AI基础设施的参考架构，整合了遥测管道、基于代理的控制和数字孪生，将可持续性作为首要设计约束。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has shifted from a software-centric discipline to an infrastructure-driven system. Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint.

Conclusion: 论文提出了两种解决方案（基于流和基于割的整数规划）及其迭代精确方法，理论和实验结果证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We focus on robust, survivable communication networks, where network links and nodes are affected by an uncertainty set. In this sense, any network links might fail. Besides, a signal can only travel a maximum distance before its quality falls below a certain threshold, necessitating its regeneration by regenerators installed at network nodes. In addition, the price of installing and maintaining regenerators belongs to a discrete uncertainty set. Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method. Our theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of our methods.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 研究开发了WHEREIS方法，用于地理定位IP前缀并评估注册数据的准确性，发现大部分数据一致，但存在RIR间差异，IPv6与IPv4表现相似，旨在提高数据透明度和政策讨论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IP地址注册数据的准确性直接影响互联网的运营、管理、安全和优化。IP地址的稀缺性引发了RIR政策与IP注册所有权和使用之间的冲突，这种冲突可能导致RIR系统的存在受到威胁。

Method: 开发了WHEREIS，一种基于测量的方法，用于在RIR区域粒度上对委派的IPv4和IPv6前缀进行地理定位，并系统地研究地址在分配后的使用位置以及注册信息的准确性。

Result: 研究发现，超过98%的前缀与地理定位推断一致，但在不同RIR之间存在显著差异，IPv6注册的准确性与IPv4相当，表明结构性问题在分配中起重要作用。

Conclusion: 通过WHEREIS方法的研究，作者希望提高IP注册数据的透明度，改善依赖这些数据的应用，并为关于区域内地址使用和政策的讨论提供信息。

Abstract: The five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) provide the critical function of IP address resource del egation and registration. The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system.
  We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations. We solicit additional information on inconsistent prefixes from network operators, IP leasing providers, and collaborate with three RIRs to obtain validation. We further show that the inconsistencies we discover manifest in three commercial geolocation databases. By improving the transparency around post-allocation prefix use, we hope to improve applications that use IP registration data and inform ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy.

### [170] [KORAL: Knowledge Graph Guided LLM Reasoning for SSD Operational Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10246)
*Mayur Akewar,Sandeep Madireddy,Dongsheng Luo,Janki Bhimani*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: KORAL是一个结合LLMs和KG的框架，用于SSD性能诊断，通过生成知识图谱和整合文献，提供专家级分析，减少对大数据集和专家输入的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SSD的性能和可靠性诊断困难，数据碎片化且时间不连贯，现有方法需要大量数据集和专家输入，但提供的见解有限。环境因素（如温度、湿度和振动）也导致性能退化。

Method: KORAL框架整合了LLMs与结构化知识图谱（KG），从碎片化的遥测数据生成数据KG，并整合了文献KG，将非结构化来源转化为可查询的图谱，指导LLM提供基于证据、可解释的分析。

Result: 评估显示，KORAL能提供专家级诊断和建议，支持基于证据的解释，提高推理透明度，指导操作决策，减少人工努力，并提供可操作的见解以提升服务质量。

Conclusion: KORAL是首个结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和知识图谱（KG）的端到端系统，用于SSD的全谱推理，包括描述性、预测性、规范性及假设分析。通过生成SSD特定的知识图谱，推动了基于知识的存储系统分析的可重复研究。

Abstract: Solid State Drives (SSDs) are critical to datacenters, consumer platforms, and mission-critical systems. Yet diagnosing their performance and reliability is difficult because data are fragmented and time-disjoint, and existing methods demand large datasets and expert input while offering only limited insights. Degradation arises not only from shifting workloads and evolving architectures but also from environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration. We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that combines LLMs and KGs for full-spectrum SSD reasoning including Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and What-if analysis. We release the generated SSD-specific KG to advance reproducible research in knowledge-based storage system analysis. GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Damrl-lab/KORAL

Motivation: 现代HPC和HPC-AI工作负载越来越依赖CDNA3 GPU的高带宽内存和高级加速器功能，但其执行特性和系统级影响尚未充分理解。

Method: 使用针对性的微基准测试对MI300A上的FP8矩阵执行、ACE并发和结构化稀疏性进行执行中心化表征。

Result: 量化了并发执行下的占用阈值、公平性、吞吐量权衡以及上下文相关的稀疏性优势，并通过代表性案例研究展示了这些效果如何转化为应用级性能和可预测性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了关于MI300A APU上FP8矩阵执行、ACE并发和结构化稀疏性的实用指南，包括占用感知调度、并发决策和稀疏性启用的建议。

Abstract: The AMD MI300A APU integrates CDNA3 GPUs with high-bandwidth memory and advanced accelerator features: FP8 matrix cores, asynchronous compute engines (ACE), and 2:4 structured sparsity. These capabilities are increasingly relied upon by modern HPC and HPC-AI workloads, yet their execution characteristics and system-level implications remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we present an execution-centric characterization of FP8 matrix execution, ACE concurrency, and structured sparsity on MI300A using targeted microbenchmarks. We quantify occupancy thresholds, fairness, throughput trade-offs under concurrent execution, and context-dependent sparsity benefits. We evaluate representative case studies - transformer-style, concurrent, and mixed-precision kernels - to show how these effects translate into application-level performance and predictability. Our results provide practical guidance for occupancy-aware scheduling, concurrency decisions, and sparsity enablement on MI300A-class unified nodes.

TL;DR: Flash-SD-KDE通过优化计算顺序和利用Tensor Cores，显著加速了SD-KDE，使其在大规模数据上变得实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SD-KDE虽然在理论上具有更好的渐近收敛速度，但由于使用经验得分导致实际计算速度显著下降，限制了其应用规模。

Method: 重新排序SD-KDE计算以暴露矩阵乘法结构，并利用Tensor Cores加速GPU实现。

Result: 在32k样本16维问题上，Flash-SD-KDE比SD-KDE GPU基线快47倍，比scikit-learn的KDE快3,300倍；在1M样本16维任务中，仅需2.3秒完成131k查询。

Conclusion: 通过重新排序SD-KDE计算以利用矩阵乘法结构，结合Tensor Cores加速GPU实现，Flash-SD-KDE在32k样本16维问题上比现有SD-KDE GPU基线快47倍，比scikit-learn的KDE快3,300倍。在更大规模的1M样本16维任务中，Flash-SD-KDE在单GPU上仅需2.3秒完成131k查询，使得得分去偏密度估计在之前不可行的规模上变得实用。

Abstract: Score-debiased kernel density estimation (SD-KDE) achieves improved asymptotic convergence rates over classical KDE, but its use of an empirical score has made it significantly slower in practice. We show that by re-ordering the SD-KDE computation to expose matrix-multiplication structure, Tensor Cores can be used to accelerate the GPU implementation. On a 32k-sample 16-dimensional problem, our approach runs up to $47\times$ faster than a strong SD-KDE GPU baseline and $3{,}300\times$ faster than scikit-learn's KDE. On a larger 1M-sample 16-dimensional task evaluated on 131k queries, Flash-SD-KDE completes in $2.3$ s on a single GPU, making score-debiased density estimation practical at previously infeasible scales.

### [173] [Computing Least Fixed Points with Overwrite Semantics in Parallel and Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10486)
*Vijay K. Garg,Rohan Garg*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出并行覆盖方法计算最小不动点，证明三种同步条件下的收敛性，适用于多种并行算法，无需连接操作或收缩假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算系统需要并行执行，而经典的Knaster-Tarski定理仅适用于单函数顺序迭代，无法满足并行覆盖语义、非原子更新和过时读取的需求。

Method: 采用坐标级覆盖方法，结合结构性约束（局部性和有限过时性），在三种同步条件下（交错语义、并行执行和分布式执行）进行理论证明。

Result: 证明了在逐步放松同步条件下（公平调度、仅变化时更新、有限过时性和局部性）的收敛性，适用于传递闭包、稳定婚姻、最短路径等问题的并行和分布式算法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了在并行和分布式环境中计算多个单调膨胀函数的最小不动点的方法，证明了三种不同同步条件下的收敛定理，为基于覆盖的并行更新提供了首个精确的最小不动点收敛保证。

Abstract: We present methods to compute least fixed points of multiple monotone inflationary functions in parallel and distributed settings. While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads. We prove three convergence theorems under progressively relaxed synchronization: (1) Interleaving semantics with fair scheduling, (2) Parallel execution with update-only-on-change semantics (processes write only on those coordinates whose values change), and (3) Distributed execution with bounded staleness (updates propagate within $T$ rounds) and $i$-locality (each process modifies only its own component).
  Our approach differs from prior work in fundamental ways: Cousot-Cousot's chaotic iteration uses join-based merges that preserve information. Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: BOute 是一个质量感知调度系统，通过多目标贝叶斯优化联合优化路由和部署，显著提升 LLM 服务的成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）部署的快速增长，成本高效的服务系统变得至关重要。当前方法在算法和系统视角存在优化空间，需要更精细的管理。

Method: BOute 采用多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）框架，共同优化路由策略和模型部署。

Result: 评估结果显示，BOute 在相同成本预算和质量要求下，性能优于现有系统，平均提升 59%，最高达 157%，或在保持相同性能目标下降低服务成本 15%-61%（平均 38%）。

Conclusion: BOute 系统通过联合优化路由策略和模型部署，显著提升了 LLM 服务的成本效率，同时保证了响应质量。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) deployments has made cost-efficient serving systems essential. Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的GPU内核对于扩展现代AI系统至关重要，但由于复杂的硬件架构和需要专业优化知识，这仍然是一项复杂的任务。大型语言模型在通用顺序代码生成方面表现出强大的能力，但在GPU代码生成方面面临挑战，原因是高质量标记训练数据的稀缺、生成合成解决方案时的编译器偏见以及跨硬件代际的有限泛化能力。

Result: 在单次尝试设置中，微调后的模型将内核正确率从43.7%提高到77.0%（+33.3个百分点），并将优于TorchInductor的问题比例从14.8%增加到21.8%（+7个百分点），同时在KernelBench上超过了先前的最先进模型。集成到完整编码代理后，能够在扩展的KernelBench套件中解决高达97.4%的问题，在72.9%的问题上优于PyTorch TorchInductor编译器，几何平均加速比为2.12倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过强化学习进行有针对性的后训练可以释放大型语言模型在高度专业化技术领域中的潜力，尤其是在传统监督学习受限于数据可用性的情况下，为AI辅助加速器编程开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决一群匿名、同质、无记忆且无显式通信的机器人在线段和圆形环境下的均匀覆盖问题，特别是在非刚性运动和异步调度条件下。

Conclusion: 该论文确定了在给定线段和圆形环境下，最小化总移动距离的均匀覆盖问题的确定性可解性，并提供了相应的分布式算法。

Abstract: We study the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem for a swarm of $n$ mobile robots on a given finite line segment and on a circle having finite positive radius, where the circle is given as an input. The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \textbf{line-segment setting}, the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost. For the circle setting, we characterize all initial configurations for which the \textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem is deterministically unsolvable under the considered robot model. For all the other remaining configurations, we provide a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage while minimizing the total distance traveled. These results characterize the deterministic solvability of min-sum coverage for oblivious robots and achieve optimal cost whenever solvable.
