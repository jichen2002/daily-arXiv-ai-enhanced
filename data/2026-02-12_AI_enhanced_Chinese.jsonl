This is most relevant in the design of spacecraft, where radiation pressure presents the dominant non-conservative forcing mechanism, which is the case beyond approximately 800 km altitude. Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u662f\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u6a21\u62df\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u529b\u8868\u793a\uff1b3. \u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9006\u5411\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f90\u5c04\u538b\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u822a\u5929\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We follow up on previous works that have analyzed the complexity of BNSL w.r.t. the so-called superstructure of the input. While known results imply that BNSL is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover in the superstructure, here we show that a different kind of parameterization - notably by the size of a feedback edge set - yields fixed-parameter tractability. We proceed by showing that this result can be strengthened to a localized version of the feedback edge set, and provide corresponding lower bounds that complement previous results to provide a complexity classification of BNSL w.r.t. virtually all well-studied graph parameters.\n  We then analyze how the complexity of BNSL depends on the representation of the input. In particular, while the bulk of past theoretical work on the topic assumed the use of the so-called non-zero representation, here we prove that if an additive representation can be used instead then BNSL becomes fixed-parameter tractable even under significantly milder restrictions to the superstructure, notably when parameterized by the treewidth alone.

While modern workloads demand diverse performance goals, ranging from coflow completion times, per-flow fairness, short-flow latencies, existing fabrics are typically hardcoded for a single metric. This rigid coupling ensures peak performance when application and network objectives align, but results in abysmal performance when they diverge.\n  We propose DMart, a decentralized scheduling framework that treats network bandwidth as a competitive marketplace. In DMart, applications independently encode the urgency and importance of their network traffic into autonomous bids, allowing diverse objectives to co-exist natively on the same fabric. To meet the extreme scale and sub-microsecond requirements of modern datacenters, DMart implements distributed, per-link, per-RTT auctions, without relying on ILPs, centralized schedulers, or complex priority queues.\n  We evaluate DMart using packet-level simulations and compare it against network schedulers designed for individual metrics, e.g., pFabric and Sincronia. DMart matches the performance of specialized schedulers on their own \"home turf\" while simultaneously optimizing secondary metrics.

The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU.

A key barrier is security: the inherently nondeterministic behavior of LLM agents defies static auditing approaches that have historically underpinned software assurance. Existing security methods, such as proxy-level input filtering and model glassboxing, fail to provide sufficient transparency or traceability into agent reasoning, state changes, or environmental interactions. In this work, we introduce AgentTrace, a dynamic observability and telemetry framework designed to fill this gap. AgentTrace instruments agents at runtime with minimal overhead, capturing a rich stream of structured logs across three surfaces: operational, cognitive, and contextual. Unlike traditional logging systems, AgentTrace emphasizes continuous, introspectable trace capture, designed not just for debugging or benchmarking, but as a foundational layer for agent security, accountability, and real-time monitoring.

A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

Yet diagnosing their performance and reliability is difficult because data are fragmented and time-disjoint, and existing methods demand large datasets and expert input while offering only limited insights. Degradation arises not only from shifting workloads and evolving architectures but also from environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vibration. We present KORAL, a knowledge driven reasoning framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) to generate insights into SSD operations. Unlike traditional approaches that require extensive expert input and large datasets, KORAL generates a Data KG from fragmented telemetry and integrates a Literature KG that already organizes knowledge from literature, reports, and traces. This turns unstructured sources into a queryable graph and telemetry into structured knowledge, and both the Graphs guide the LLM to deliver evidence-based, explainable analysis aligned with the domain vocabulary and constraints. Evaluation using real production traces shows that the KORAL delivers expert-level diagnosis and recommendations, supported by grounded explanations that improve reasoning transparency, guide operator decisions, reduce manual effort, and provide actionable insights to improve service quality. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end system that combines LLMs and KGs for full-spectrum SSD reasoning including Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and What-if analysis. We release the generated SSD-specific KG to advance reproducible research in knowledge-based storage system analysis.

Requests arrive sequentially as node pairs. If the nodes lie in different clusters, the algorithm pays unit cost. After each request, the algorithm may migrate nodes between clusters at unit cost per node. This problem models datacenter resource allocation where virtual machines must be assigned to servers, balancing communication costs against migration overhead.\n  We study the variant where requests are restricted to edges of a ring network, an abstraction of ring-allreduce patterns in distributed machine learning. Despite this restriction, the problem remains challenging with an $\u03a9(n)$ deterministic lower bound. We present a randomized algorithm achieving $O(\\varepsilon^{-3} \\cdot \\log^2 n)$ competitive ratio using resource augmentation that allows clusters of size at most $(3/4 + \\varepsilon) \\cdot n$.\n  Our approach formulates the problem as a metrical task system with a restricted state space. By limiting the number of cut-edges (i.e., ring edges between clusters) to at most $2k$, where $k = \u0398(1/\\varepsilon)$, we reduce the state space from exponential to polynomial (i.e., $n^{O(k)}$). The key technical contribution is proving that this restriction increases cost by only a factor of $O(k)$. Our algorithm follows by applying the randomized MTS solution of Bubeck et al.

At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5bf9\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5168\u5bf9\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5149\u4e92\u8fde\u6280\u672f\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u62d3\u6251\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u62d3\u6251\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u548c\u53ca\u5176\u5e42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6d88\u606f\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5168\u5bf9\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u8fbe44%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u548c\u53ca\u5176\u5e42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5168\u5bf9\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

Generated Python implementations are assessed through staged executability checks, model-independent statistical comparison against a validated NetLogo baseline, and quantitative measures of runtime efficiency and maintainability.

The last two authors advised equally", "summary": "Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiveMedBench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 LiveMedBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u89e3\u533b\u751f\u56de\u7b54\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "LiveMedBench \u5305\u542b 2,756 \u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\u548c 16,702 \u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8fbe\u5230 39.2% \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c84% \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u622a\u6b62\u540e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "LiveMedBench \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0cLiveMedBench \u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

A recent work of Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, and Smith (NeurIPS '23) shows that for streams of length $T$, polynomial additive error of $\u03a9(T^{1/4})$ is necessary, even without any space restrictions. We show that this additive error lower bound can be circumvented if the algorithm is allowed to output estimates with both additive \\emph{and multiplicative} error. We give an algorithm for the continual release of the number of distinct elements with $\\text{polylog} (T)$ multiplicative and $\\text{polylog}(T)$ additive error. We also show a qualitatively similar phenomenon for estimating the $F_2$ moment of a turnstile stream, where we can obtain $1+o(1)$ multiplicative and $\\text{polylog} (T)$ additive error. Both results can be achieved using polylogarithmic space whereas prior approaches use polynomial space. In the sublinear space regime, some multiplicative error is necessary even if privacy is not a consideration.

We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers.

However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings.

Submitted and Accepted to the WSESE 2026 ICSE Workshop", "summary": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn growing interest within the scientific community. LLMs can handle large volumes of textual data and support methods for evidence synthesis. Although recent studies highlight the potential of LLMs to accelerate screening and data extraction steps in systematic reviews, detailed reports of their practical application throughout the entire process remain scarce. This paper presents an experience report on the conduction of a systematic mapping study with the support of LLMs, describing the steps followed, the necessary adjustments, and the main challenges faced. Positive aspects are discussed, such as (i) the significant reduction of time in repetitive tasks and (ii) greater standardization in data extraction, as well as negative aspects, including (i) considerable effort to build reliable well-structured prompts, especially for less experienced users, since achieving effective prompts may require several iterations and testing, which can partially offset the expected time savings, (ii) the occurrence of hallucinations, and (iii) the need for constant manual verification. As a contribution, this work offers lessons learned and practical recommendations for researchers interested in adopting LLMs in systematic mappings and reviews, highlighting both efficiency gains and methodological risks and limitations to be considered.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u6b65\u9aa4\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u62a5\u544a\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u5fc5\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u624b\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u4f2f\u6069\u65af\u5766\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u5bfc\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u969c\u788d\u7269\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

This shows that the exponential loss incurred by the BGS algorithm for the case of Alternating-Threshold polymorphisms is necessary, in contrast to the polynomial loss achievable for Majority polymorphisms.\n  For any Boolean PCSP that admits Majority polymorphisms, we give an algorithm satisfying $1-O(\\sqrt\u03b5)$ fraction of the weaker constraints when promised the existence of an assignment satisfying $1-\u03b5$ fraction of the stronger constraints. This significantly generalizes the Charikar--Makarychev--Makarychev algorithm for 2-SAT, and matches the optimal trade-off possible under the UGC. The algorithm also extends, with the loss of an extra $\\log (1/\u03b5)$ factor, to PCSPs on larger domains with a certain structural condition, which is implied by, e.g., a family of Plurality polymorphisms.\n  We prove that assuming the UGC, robust satisfiability is preserved under the addition of equality constraints. As a consequence, we can extend the rich algebraic techniques for decision/search PCSPs to robust PCSPs.

However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels.

We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads.

However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates high-level commonsense reasoning from foundation models into the process of legged locomotion adaptation. Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u817f\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e91\u7aef\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u817f\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u6574\u5408\u5230\u817f\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u57fa\u7840\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ea7\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u8bae\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8687%\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe87%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads. We prove three convergence theorems under progressively relaxed synchronization: (1) Interleaving semantics with fair scheduling, (2) Parallel execution with update-only-on-change semantics (processes write only on those coordinates whose values change), and (3) Distributed execution with bounded staleness (updates propagate within $T$ rounds) and $i$-locality (each process modifies only its own component).\n  Our approach differs from prior work in fundamental ways: Cousot-Cousot's chaotic iteration uses join-based merges that preserve information. Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u79cd\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fde\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u6536\u7f29\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684Knaster-Tarski\u5b9a\u7406\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u987a\u5e8f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e76\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u975e\u539f\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u8fc7\u65f6\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5750\u6807\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8fc7\u65f6\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u4ea4\u9519\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9010\u6b65\u653e\u677e\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u516c\u5e73\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u4ec5\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u6709\u9650\u8fc7\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u9012\u95ed\u5305\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5a5a\u59fb\u3001\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u8c03\u81a8\u80c0\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning.

A long sequence of works has studied both (efficient) shortcut constructions and impossibility results on the best diameter and therefore the best parallelism that can be achieved with this approach.\n  This paper introduces a new conceptual and technical tool, called certified shortcuts, for this line of research in the form of a simple and natural structural criterion that holds for any shortcut constructed by an efficient (combinatorial) algorithm. It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques.\n  Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms.

Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Wormhole\u901a\u8fc7\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347PLDES\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "PLDES\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8981\u4e48\u7b80\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4f46\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u533a\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u79bb\u6563\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "Wormhole\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86744\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff08MoE\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b510\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee<1%\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u5e76\u884c\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u8fbe1012\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Wormhole\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PLDES\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current evaluations systematically overlook the third goal. Specifically, they either treat existing code as ground truth (a compliance trap) for regression prevention, or depend on post-failure artifacts (e.g., issue reports) for bug reproduction-so they rarely surface defects before failures. To bridge this gap, we present TestExplora, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs as proactive testers within full-scale, realistic repository environments. TestExplora contains 2,389 tasks from 482 repositories and hides all defect-related signals. Models must proactively find bugs by comparing implementations against documentation-derived intent, using documentation as the oracle. Furthermore, to keep evaluation sustainable and reduce leakage, we propose continuous, time-aware data collection. Our evaluation reveals a significant capability gap: state-of-the-art models achieve a maximum Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rate of only 16.06%. Further analysis indicates that navigating complex cross-module interactions and leveraging agentic exploration are critical to advancing LLMs toward autonomous software quality assurance.

However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning.

Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOute \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u7531\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 LLM \u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "BOute \u91c7\u7528\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MOBO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cBOute \u5728\u76f8\u540c\u6210\u672c\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347 59%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe 157%\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u6027\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c 15%-61%\uff08\u5e73\u5747 38%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "BOute \u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 LLM \u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x.

In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA.

Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy.

Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height.

Abdelfattah"], "title": "Fine-Tuning GPT-5 for GPU Kernel Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x.

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FoSS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGFlowNets\u7684span\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001span\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u548cDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u548c\u6811\u72b6\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9DAG\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlow of SpanS (FOSS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u5206\u5272\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001span\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u786e\u4fddDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528GFlowNets\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "FoSS\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dMAUVE\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534712.5%\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u53473.5%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u68c0\u7d22\u8bed\u6599\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "FoSS\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001span\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u548cDAG\u7ed3\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

A common assumption may explain this gap: that denser sensor deployments yield better accuracy. We tested this assumption with a 12-day naturalistic study using a 9-node ESP32-C3 mesh (72 sensing links) in a residential environment. Our results show that a single well-placed link outperformed the full 72-link mesh (AUC 0.541 vs. 0.489, Cohen's $d$=0.86). Even a random link selection matched optimized selection ($p$=0.35). The benefit comes from avoiding multi-link fusion, not from choosing the right link.

However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\\% with only a 5.3\\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline.

The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \\textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \\textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \\textbf{line-segment setting}, the \\textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \\textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost.

In $O(n\\log\u03c3)$ bits of space, this fundamental task admits constant-time queries. While this is optimal in the worst case, much research has focused on compressible strings, hoping for smaller data structures that still admit efficient queries.\n  We investigate the grammar-compressed setting, where $T$ is represented by a straight-line grammar. Our main result is a general trade-off that optimizes Random Access time as a function of string length $n$, grammar size (the total length of productions) $g$, alphabet size $\u03c3$, data structure size $M$, and word size $w=\u03a9(\\log n)$ of the word RAM model. For any $M$ with $g\\log n<Mw<n\\log\u03c3$, we show an $O(M)$-size data structure with query time $O(\\frac{\\log(n\\log\u03c3\\,/\\,Mw)}{\\log(Mw\\,/\\,g\\log n)})$. Remarkably, we also prove a matching unconditional lower bound that holds for all parameter regimes except very small grammars and relatively small data structures.\n  Previous work focused on query time as a function of $n$ only, achieving $O(\\log n)$ time using $O(g)$ space [Bille et al.; SIAM J. Comput. 2015] and $O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n})$ time using $O(g\\log^\u03b5 n)$ space for any constant $\u03b5> 0$ [Belazzougui et al.; ESA'15], [Ganardi, Je\u017c, Lohrey; J. ACM 2021]. The only tight lower bound [Verbin and Yu; CPM'13] was $\u03a9(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$ for $w=\u0398(\\log n)$, $n^{\u03a9(1)}\\le g\\le n^{1-\u03a9(1)}$, and $M=g\\log^{\u0398(1)}n$. In contrast, our result yields tight bounds in all relevant parameters and almost all regimes.\n  Our data structure admits efficient deterministic construction.

Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e3b\u6743\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u4ece\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5df2\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u4e3b\u6743\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u5851\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9065\u6d4b\u3001\u4ee3\u7406AI\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e3b\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u6743AI\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1aAI\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u8f93\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6743AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u9065\u6d4b\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5.

Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data.

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems.

They have become an important feature of compressed text indexes using space proportional to the number of Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) runs, often applied in genomics. This is in thanks not only to theoretical improvements over past approaches, but great cache efficiency and average case query time in practice. This is true even without using the worst case guarantees provided by the interval splitting balancing of the original result. In this paper, we show that an even simpler type of splitting, length capping by truncating long intervals, bounds the average move structure query time to optimal whilst obtaining a superior construction time than the traditional approach. This also proves constant query time when amortized over a full traversal of a single cycle permutation from an arbitrary starting position.\n  Such a scheme has surprising benefits both in theory and practice. We leverage the approach to improve the representation of any move structure with $r$ runs over a domain $n$ to $O(r \\log r + r \\log \\frac{n}{r})$-bits of space. The worst case query time is also improved to $O(\\log \\frac{n}{r})$ without balancing. An $O(r)$-time and $O(r)$-space construction lets us apply the method to run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) permutations such as LF and $\u03c6$ to obtain optimal-time algorithms for BWT inversion and suffix array (SA) enumeration in $O(r)$ additional working space. Finally, we provide the RunPerm library, providing flexible plug and play move structure support, and use it to evaluate our splitting approach.

Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method.

In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic.

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces.

The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system.\n  We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations.

While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software.

Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks.

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLMware\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLiAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMware\u4e2d\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GitHub\u548cHugging Face\u6536\u96c6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LiAgent\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "LiAgent\u5728\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523087%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8614\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u523060\u4e2a\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LiAgent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301LLMware\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u548cMPC\u7684\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u76f8\u673a\u66f4\u65b0\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4fef\u4ef0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0e\u503e\u659c\u80c3\u58c1\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u548c\u626d\u77e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u521a\u4f53\u4fef\u4ef0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MPC\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPC\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u5f00\u5173\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea63\u52305\u500d\u7684\u66f4\u5feb\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u632f\u8361\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08EKF\uff09\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f4e\u76f8\u673a\u66f4\u65b0\u7387\uff081 Hz\uff09\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education.

Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches.

Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment.

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ERGO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u56fe\u50cf3D\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u62103D\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u89c6\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6ERGO\uff0c\u5c063D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728Google Scanned Objects\u548cOmniObject3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cERGO\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ERGO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8d85\u989d\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "PELLI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u9879LLM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GPT-4T\u548cGemini\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4ec5\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\u4e14\u4ec5\u9009\u62e9\u5c11\u6570LLM\uff08\u5982Codex\u548cChatGPT\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002PELLI\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdbLLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPELLI\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u9879\u6d41\u884cLLM\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9075\u5faaPython\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "GPT-4T\u548cGemini\u5728\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u9879\u975e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff09\uff0cGPT-4T\u548cGemini\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u4f18\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002"}}

Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability.

RE principles were first derived through qualitative data collection spanning more than 25 sprints, approximately 320 weekly synchronisation meetings, and seven cross-company, company-specific workshops between 2019 and 2024. These activities engaged practitioners from diverse roles, representing several hundred developers across domains. In late 2024, five in depth focus groups with senior leaders at Grundfos provided retrospective validation of the principles and assessed their strategic impact. We aim to (1) empirically examine RE principles in large scale agile system development, (2) explore their benefits in practice within the case company, and (3) identify a set of transferable RE principles for large scale contexts. Using thematic analysis, six key RE principles architectural context, stakeholder-driven validation and alignment, requirements practices in large-scale agile organisations. evolution with lightweight documentation, delegated requirements management, organisational roles and responsibilities, and a shared understanding of requirements are derived. The study was further validated through crosscompany expert evaluation with three additional multinational organisations (Bosch, Ericsson, and Volvo Cars), which are directly responsible for largescale requirements management. Together, these efforts provide a scalable and adaptable foundation for improving requirements practices in largescale agile organisations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u5e74\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u516d\u9879\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u5bb6\u4f01\u4e1a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u5e74\u7eb5\u5411\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec25\u4e2a\u51b2\u523a\u3001320\u6b21\u5468\u540c\u6b65\u4f1a\u8bae\u548c7\u6b21\u8de8\u516c\u53f8\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u516d\u9879\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u516d\u9879\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6587\u6863\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u5bb6\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u654f\u6377\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u516d\u9879\u5173\u952e\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9700\u6c42\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding.

Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f2\u63a8\u65ad\u5c4b\u9876\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u9ad8\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7740\u9646\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u58f0\u5b66\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c4b\u9876\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u65f6\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u626d\u77e9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u89e6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f2\u63a8\u65ad\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6210\u529f\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe30.5\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u5e76\u57289\u6b21\u4e0d\u540c\u503e\u659c\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u503e\u659c\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.87\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u503e\u659c\u5c4b\u9876\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6587\u5316\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7d27\u5bc6\u4ea4\u7ec7\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u70f9\u996a\u98df\u8c31\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5728\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u98df\u8c31\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u98df\u8c31\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "LLM\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u6587\u5316\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates.

To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages.

While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks.

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use.

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u8303\u5f0f\uff08LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u6839\u672c\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u6982\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u76d1\u7763\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u4e0d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1f", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u5206\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528Dafny\u89c4\u8303\u548cZ3 SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57287\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4LLM-as-a-Judge\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8616.6%\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f31\u5230\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff087B\u6cd5\u5b98\u68c0\u6d4b72B\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities.

Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment.

By integrating registration feedback into the sensing loop, our approach optimally balances point density, noise, and sparsity, improving registration accuracy and efficiency.

However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE.

It's a diverse dataset covering 10 common household waste categories: metal, glass, biological, paper, battery, trash, cardboard, shoes, clothes, and plastic. The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence.

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control.

However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning.

Schoellig"], "title": "SQ-CBF: Signed Distance Functions for Numerically Stable Superquadric-Based Safety Filtering", "comment": null, "summary": "Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks.

In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction.

Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework.

This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8f6e\u5f0f\u88c5\u8f7d\u673a\u6316\u6398\u65f6\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u788e\u77f3\u5806\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6216\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ca9\u77f3\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u673a\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u9897\u7c92\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u5806\u6316\u6398\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e24\u5806\u5ca9\u77f3\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7834\u788e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u53ca\u91c7\u6837\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7b5b\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f6e\u5f0f\u88c5\u8f7d\u673a\u6316\u6398\u65f6\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u788e\u77f3\u5806\u76f8\u5bf9\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65b0\u578b\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u63d0\u901f\uff0c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u63d0\u8d28\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u72ed\u7a84\u901a\u9053\u3001\u5927\u95f4\u9699\u8de8\u8d8a\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u540e\u9000\u89c6\u91ce\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u63a5\u89e6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u77ed\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u89c4\u5212\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5feb45%\u81f398%\uff0c\u957f\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u51cf\u5c118%\u81f347%\u7684\u7ad9\u59ff\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u77ed\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c4\u5212\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.\n  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability.

However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench.

Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "APEX\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u68d8\u8f6e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u9ad8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u904d\u5386\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dDRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u9ad8\u5e73\u53f0\u904d\u5386\u4e2d\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u51b2\u51fb\u3001\u626d\u77e9\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPEX\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u5f62\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u6500\u722c\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u8c03\u6574\uff09\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u68d8\u8f6e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u7eb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cAPEX\u80fd\u572829-DoF Unitree G1\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5c04\u51fb\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9ad8\u5e73\u53f0\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "conclusion": "APEX\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u9ad8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u5c04\u51fb\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57280.8\u7c73\u5e73\u53f0\uff08\u7ea6114%\u817f\u957f\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation.

This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation.

Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200.

To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR.

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCyclingVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a91\u884c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u7279\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u56f4\u7ed5\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9a91\u884c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86CyclingVQA\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3031+\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u9a91\u884c\u7279\u6709\u4ea4\u901a\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u5173\u8054\u5bfc\u822a\u8f66\u9053\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9a91\u884c\u7279\u6709\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u7ebf\u7d22\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u8f66\u9053\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u5411\u9a91\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer.

Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "PP-DNN\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROIs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AV\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29DNN\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800cPP-DNN\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u9700\u5904\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "PP-DNN\u5229\u7528ROI\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROIs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7FLOPs\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4bMACs\uff0c\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2aDNN\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROIs\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u5728BDD100K\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cPP-DNN\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5e27\u6570\u589e\u52a07.3\u500d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11>2.6\u500d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53d8\u5f02\u51cf\u5c11>2.3\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u63d0\u9ad875.4%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe98%\u3002", "conclusion": "PP-DNN\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROIs\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u591a\u79df\u6237DNN\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u9891\u7387\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u6574\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9891\u7387\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\u5c42\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6743\u91cd\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches.

It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).\n  Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets.

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality.

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features.

These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50.

Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility.

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors.

While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step.

This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification.

A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training", "comment": null, "summary": "The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

Our code is available https://github.com/Daraksh/Fairness_StrideNet", "summary": "Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics.

However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse.

However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features.

However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation.

The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy.

Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks.

While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement.

However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhyCritic\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406AI\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5224\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684RLVR\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u53c2\u7167\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u5224\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\u524d\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "result": "PhyCritic\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCritic\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684RLVR\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations.
