*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DD-MDN是一种端到端概率HTF模型，结合高位置准确性、校准uncertainty和短观察鲁棒性，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在uncertainty建模、校准和短观察期预测方面关注不足，而这些对于下游任务（如路径规划和碰撞避免）至关重要。

Method: 使用few-shot去噪扩散主干和双混合密度网络，学习自校准的停留区域和概率排序的锚点路径，无需预定义锚点或端点。

Result: 实验结果表明，DD-MDN在位置准确性、校准uncertainty和短观察鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DD-MDN模型在ETH/UCY、SDD、inD和IMPTC数据集上展示了最先进的准确性、短观察间隔下的鲁棒性以及可靠的uncertainty建模。

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

TL;DR: ABot-M0通过统一数据表示和AML方法，提升跨平台机器人动作预测效率与稳定性，支持通用具身智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人领域因数据碎片化、表示不一致和训练目标不匹配而导致的通用具身智能发展障碍。

Method: 提出Action Manifold Learning (AML)，基于Action Manifold Hypothesis，使用DiT骨干网络直接预测连续动作序列，并通过双流机制整合VLM语义与几何先验。

Result: 构建了UniACT-dataset（包含600万轨迹和9500小时数据），实验证明各组件独立运行且具有叠加效益。

Conclusion: ABot-M0框架通过系统化的数据整理流程和联合优化模型架构与训练策略，成功将异构原始数据转化为统一高效的表示，支持跨平台和任务的通用具身智能。

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一个基于深度学习的自动化模型（EfficientNetB3和DenseNet201），用于茶叶病害分类，准确率分别达到93%和91%，为农业管理提供了高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 茶叶是孟加拉国经济的重要资产，但茶叶易受多种叶部病害影响，导致产量下降和品质降低。手动检测这些病害既耗时又容易出错，因此研究旨在开发一个基于深度学习的自动化模型，以更高效、准确地分类茶叶病害。

Method: 研究采用了数据预处理、数据分割、对抗训练、数据增强、模型训练、评估以及通过可解释AI策略进行模型理解。具体使用了DenseNet201和EfficientNetB3模型进行分类任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，EfficientNetB3模型达到了93%的最高分类准确率，DenseNet201模型达到91%。对抗训练和Grad-CAM可视化进一步增强了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够准确检测茶叶病害，并为先进的农业管理提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero框架通过主动探索视觉环境，提升视觉语言模型的自我学习效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的自学习方法依赖静态图像集的被动交互，导致学习效率低下且对初始数据集依赖性强。

Method: Active-Zero框架包含三个协同进化的智能体：Searcher、Questioner和Solver，通过主动检索图像、生成校准推理任务和基于准确率奖励优化，形成闭环自我学习轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型上，Active-Zero在12个基准测试中平均推理任务准确率提升5.7%，通用理解任务提升3.9%。

Conclusion: Active-Zero框架通过主动探索视觉环境，显著提升了视觉语言模型的自我进化能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有自学习方法。

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

### [5] [ReTracing: An Archaeological Approach Through Body, Machine, and Generative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11242)
*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing是一个多智能体表演艺术项目，通过AI生成的动作指令指导人类和机器人表演，揭示生成系统中的文化偏见，并探讨AI时代的‘人性’定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过考古学方法，探索人工智能如何塑造、限制和产生身体动作，并揭示生成系统中的社会文化偏见。

Method: 项目从科幻小说中提取人机互动的句子，使用大语言模型生成‘做什么’和‘不做什么’的提示对，再通过扩散模型将其转化为人类表演者的编舞指导和四足机器人的电机指令。通过多摄像头运动捕捉和3D重建技术记录动作痕迹。

Result: ReTracing创建了一个动作痕迹的数字档案，展示了AI、人类和机器人之间的沉浸式互动，揭示了生成系统在动作编排中的偏见编码。

Conclusion: ReTracing通过人类与AI机器人的互动表演，揭示了生成系统如何通过编排动作编码社会文化偏见，并探讨了在AI时代‘人类意味着什么’的核心问题。

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有3D模型生成方法（如摄影测量）中缺乏可量化比较的问题。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的管道，用于从高质量3D模型生成合成图像，并通过程序生成的相机姿态进行测试，从而实现了可重复、可量化的实验。

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视频语言模型是否能够稳健地处理视频内容、时间序列和运动，揭示现有模型的不足，并为未来研究提供支持。

Method: 研究通过REVEAL{}诊断基准，设计了五个控制压力测试来评估VidLMs的弱点，并测试了领先的开源和闭源VidLMs。同时，提供了一个自动生成诊断示例的数据管道。

Result: 测试显示，VidLMs在处理反向场景、忽视视频内容回答问题、同意错误声明、基本相机运动和简单时空遮挡下的时间信息聚合等方面表现不佳，而人类在这些任务上轻松成功。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前的视频语言模型（VidLMs）在视频内容、时间序列和运动的稳健性上存在显著不足。通过REVEAL{}基准测试，揭示了这些模型在时间期望偏差、语言捷径依赖、视频谄媚、相机运动敏感性和时空遮挡鲁棒性等方面的基本弱点。

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

Result: 实验证明TexSpot在视觉保真度、几何一致性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有最先进的3D纹理生成和增强方法。

Conclusion: TexSpot通过引入Texlet这一新颖的3D纹理表示方法，结合点基和UV基表示的优势，显著提升了3D纹理生成的视觉保真度、几何一致性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

### [9] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SYNC loss，通过整合后验方法（softmax响应）和选择性网络训练，利用选择性先验提升模型的选择性预测性能，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的选择性预测方法要么是临时性的（如SelectiveNet），要么是后验性的（如softmax响应），而后验方法生成的选择性先验仅在推理阶段使用。作者认为选择性先验在训练阶段同样重要，因此提出了SYNC loss来整合这两种方法。

Method: 提出了SYNC loss，将后验方法（如softmax响应）与选择性网络（SelectiveNet）的训练过程相结合，通过选择性先验增强模型的选择性预测能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Stanford Cars等数据集上，SYNC loss不仅提升了模型的泛化能力，还在选择性预测性能上超越了以往工作，达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的选择性预测方法SYNC loss，通过将后验方法（如softmax响应）整合到训练过程中，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和选择性预测性能，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种整合学习深度先验到VINS-Mono优化后端的新方法，通过强制深度一致性和序数约束，在边缘设备上实现实时性能，显著提升了低纹理环境中的VIO准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目视觉-惯性里程计（VIO）系统在低纹理环境中表现不佳，稀疏的视觉特征不足以进行准确的姿态估计。为了解决这个问题，密集单目深度估计（MDE）被广泛探索作为补充信息源。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架，整合学习深度先验到VINS-Mono优化后端，强制仿射不变深度一致性和成对序数约束，通过基于方差的门控显式过滤不稳定伪影。

Result: 在TartanGround和M3ED数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在挑战性场景中防止发散，并带来显著的准确性提升，绝对轨迹误差（ATE）减少了高达28.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过在VINS-Mono优化后端直接整合学习深度先验，提出了一种新颖的框架，强制仿射不变深度一致性和成对序数约束，通过基于方差的门控显式过滤不稳定伪影，严格遵循边缘设备的计算限制，同时稳健地恢复度量尺度。

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有艺术史文章通常讨论艺术作品的整体或特定部分（如布局、图像学或物质文化），但缺乏将这些信息与具体作品关联的工具。

Method: 使用定制的语料库收集流程，并通过 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) 学习一个领域特定的 CLIP 模型（PaintingCLIP），该模型在弱监督下表现优于原始 CLIP。

Result: 提出的 PaintingCLIP 模型在弱监督下表现优于 CLIP，能够为给定艺术作品提供有效的上下文信息。

Conclusion: ArtContext 提出了一种新颖的流程，通过结合开放获取的艺术史文章和 Wikidata 知识，为艺术作品提供上下文信息。该方法具有通用性，可广泛应用于其他人文学科领域。

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

TL;DR: Latent Forcing 通过联合处理潜在空间和像素，优化噪声计划，提升了扩散模型在原始图像上的效率，并在 ImageNet 上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在生成高质量图像时丢失了端到端建模的优势，且在图像编码过程中丢弃信息，需要单独训练解码器，并对原始数据的辅助分布进行建模。

Method: 提出 Latent Forcing，通过联合处理潜在空间和像素，并分别调整噪声计划，使潜在空间作为中间计算的暂存区。

Result: 在 ImageNet 上，Latent Forcing 实现了基于扩散变换器的像素生成的最新性能。

Conclusion: Latent Forcing 通过联合处理潜在空间和像素，并分别调整噪声计划，实现了在原始自然图像上高效运行的潜在扩散模型，为基于扩散变换器的像素生成设定了新的性能标准。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

TL;DR: Proposed method uses high-res CTA to train a neural implicit function for better cardiac shape reconstruction from CMRI, showing improved accuracy in RV and MYO modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The anisotropic nature of SAX CMRI limits cardiac shape analysis, prompting the use of higher resolution CTA data to enhance reconstruction accuracy.

Method: A single neural implicit function is trained using near-isotropic, higher resolution CTA data to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. Performance is evaluated by reconstructing RV and MYO shapes and comparing them to reference 4CH segmentation masks.

Result: The method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.91 ± 0.07 for RV and 0.75 ± 0.13 for MYO, with Hausdorff distances of 6.21 ± 3.97 mm and 7.53 ± 5.13 mm, respectively, demonstrating improved shape reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully leverages high-resolution CTA data to improve cardiac shape reconstruction from CMRI, achieving accurate and anatomically plausible results.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

TL;DR: Ctrl&Shift是一个无需显式3D建模的扩散框架，通过两阶段操纵和多任务训练，实现了几何一致的对象操纵，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时实现背景保留、视角变化下的几何一致性和用户可控变换。几何方法提供精确控制但泛化差，扩散方法泛化好但缺乏几何控制。

Method: Ctrl&Shift是一个端到端的扩散框架，通过将操纵分解为两个阶段（对象移除和参考引导的修复）并在统一的扩散过程中编码这两者。设计了多任务、多阶段的训练策略，以分离背景、身份和姿态信号。

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift是首个在不依赖显式3D建模的情况下，统一细粒度几何控制和真实世界泛化的对象操纵框架，实现了在保真度、视角一致性和可控性方面的最先进效果。

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对超低场DTI的九方向单壳序列及配套校正与超分辨率算法（DiffSR），显著提升了图像质量和白质信息恢复能力，并在阿尔茨海默病分类中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低场磁共振成像（ULF MRI）虽具有便携性优势，但其空间和角度分辨率低、信噪比差，尤其在扩散张量成像（DTI）中表现更为明显。此外，ULF DTI扫描存在空间和角度域的伪影，需要定制化算法进行校正。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种针对超低场（ULF）扩散张量成像（DTI）的九方向单壳序列，以及配套的贝叶斯偏置场校正算法和基于卷积神经网络的超分辨率算法（DiffSR）。这些方法在合成降采样实验和真实匹配的ULF与高场DTI扫描中证明了其有效性，能够恢复微观结构和体积白质信息。此外，DiffSR可直接应用于阿尔茨海默病的白质分类，且在DTI指标一致性上表现优异。

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Conclusion: DBTANet通过整合全局语义、局部细节、时间推理和边界感知，在两个公开基准测试上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有特征压缩方法通常针对特定压缩比设计，缺乏灵活性和泛化能力，适应新压缩比需重新训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出了任意比率特征压缩（ARFC）框架，核心是自回归模型（ARC），通过调整生成令牌数量控制压缩比，并引入混合解决方案（MoS）模块和实体关系图约束（ERGC）提升压缩质量。

Result: 在跨模态检索、图像分类和图像检索任务中，ARFC在多种压缩比下均优于现有方法，部分情况下甚至超越未压缩特征的性能。

Conclusion: ARFC框架通过单一模型支持任意压缩比，显著提高了特征压缩的灵活性和泛化能力，且在多个任务和数据集上表现优于现有方法，甚至在某些情况下超越了未压缩特征的性能。

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Motivation: 当前深度学习在X射线血管造影分析中的应用受限于标注数据的稀缺，而大规模自监督学习（SSL）在该领域的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: VasoMIM框架包含两个关键设计：解剖学引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，前者强制模型学习稳健的血管语义，后者增强学习表征的可区分性。

Conclusion: VasoMIM和XA-170K作为X射线血管造影分析的基础模型，展示了显著的潜力，并在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

Motivation: 降低PET扫描的辐射剂量或时间会降低图像质量，而利用MR图像辅助恢复标准剂量PET图像面临多模态融合的结构不一致和OOD数据不匹配的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种监督辅助的多模态融合扩散模型（MFdiff），包括多模态特征融合模块和两阶段监督辅助学习策略。

Conclusion: MFdiff模型通过多模态特征融合和扩散模型，有效解决了低剂量PET图像恢复中的结构不一致和OOD数据不匹配问题，显著提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于生成压缩框架的图像去噪方法，通过熵编码的潜在表示和生成解码器，在保持低复杂度结构的同时恢复真实纹理，实验证明在保持竞争性失真性能的同时实现了感知上的持续改进。

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LUVE achieves superior photorealism and content fidelity in UHR video generation, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: FlowAdapt通过最优传输理论解决了多智能体系统中快速领域适应的关键问题，显著提升了性能与训练稳定性，仅需1%的可训练参数即可实现最先进的表现。

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Conclusion: 将大型语言模型（LLM）集成到基于视觉的结构健康监测（SHM）中，特别是在快速灾后勘察方面，显示出通过有效勘察提高建筑环境韧性的潜力。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

Conclusion: PLOT-CT框架通过预对数域中的Voronoi分解显著提升了低剂量CT重建的精度，有效抑制噪声并保留结构信息，实现了优于传统方法的性能。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Conclusion: PLESS作为一种通用的伪标签增强策略，通过分层分区和空间一致性改进，显著提升了现有伪标签方法的性能，实验验证了其在心脏MRI数据集上的有效性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Conclusion: 该方法通过将表面重建编码为泊松方程的解决方案，并利用格林函数获得闭式参数表达式，展示了在高频细节近似上的改进效果。

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

Method: 研究基于ResNet、ResNeXt和扩张ResNet变体的BrainNet、BrainNeXt和DilationNet模型，评估了它们在三种预处理配置下的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: BrainNeXt模型对黑盒攻击表现出最高的鲁棒性，而BrainNet和Dilation模型更容易受到攻击。缩小和非增强数据显著降低了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在脑MRI分析中联合评估分类性能和对抗鲁棒性的重要性，以确保实际部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion框架通过结合离散高斯表示（GR）的几何先验和扩散模型的生成能力，显著提升了3D全身PET重建的图像质量，尤其在低剂量条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在自动驾驶中需要大量计算资源，现有减少视觉token的方法常导致性能下降。

Method: 提出SToRM框架，包含三个关键元素：轻量级重要性预测器、监督训练方法和锚点-上下文合并模块。

Result: 在相同减少token预算下，SToRM优于现有E2E驾驶MLLMs，保持全token性能的同时降低计算成本。

Conclusion: SToRM框架在保持与使用所有token相当性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本（高达30倍），在LangAuto基准测试中优于现有最先进的E2E驾驶MLLMs。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Clutt3R-Seg在杂乱和稀疏视角场景中表现优于现有基线方法，尤其在重度杂乱序列中AP@25达到61.66，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，结合视线超出边界分类任务可以提升性能，而多视角协同学习方法未带来显著增益，并对颈部佩戴视线估计的潜在应用进行了讨论。

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba 在 OmniObject3D 基准测试中表现优异，支持超过 200 个对象类别，并在任意方向下实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

Conclusion: 语义控制的潜在扩散模型（LDM）能够生成适用于下游算法开发、研究和培训的逼真合成DSA图像。

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM通过双向耦合视觉里程计和高斯泼溅，在实时性、几何/光度保真度及跟踪精度上达到先进水平。

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: JEPA-VLA通过整合预测性嵌入显著提升了VLA模型的性能，解决了现有视觉表示在环境理解和策略先验方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）中文本描述与视觉坐标之间的不对齐问题，尤其是在密集预测任务（如空间-时间视频定位）中，避免引入额外的可训练模块和高昂的标注成本。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的视觉提示范式，将每帧坐标预测转化为实例级识别问题，并为每个对象分配唯一且时间一致的ID。此外，引入了STVG-R1强化学习框架，联合优化时间准确性、空间一致性和结构格式正则化。

Conclusion: STVG-R1 通过视觉提示和强化学习框架显著提升了空间-时间视频定位任务的性能，并在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，同时展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Conclusion: DiffPlace通过引入place-ID控制器，显著提升了多视角图像生成的背景一致性和地点感知能力，为自动驾驶中的地点识别任务提供了有效的生成样本支持。

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

Conclusion: 通过针对性的适应策略，通用视觉语言模型（VLM）在保持广泛多模态能力的同时，显著提升了电子商务领域的表现。

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型中的对象幻觉问题，并提出改进视觉对比解码的方法。

Method: 利用自监督视觉变换器中的对象中心注意力机制，移除最显著的视觉证据以构建辅助视图，从而干扰不受支持的标记并产生更强的对比信号。

Result: 在两个流行的对象幻觉基准测试和两个MLLMs上，该方法展示了持续的增益。

Conclusion: 通过构建对象对齐的辅助视图改进视觉对比解码（VCD），显著减少了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的对象幻觉问题。

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADTE通过自适应去偏Tsallis熵优化CLIP模型的测试时适应，显著提升性能，无需额外调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CLIP模型在预训练时使用了高度不平衡的网络爬取数据，导致Shannon熵（SE）在测试时无法准确衡量预测不确定性。Tsallis熵（TE）作为一种广义熵，更适合表征有偏分布，因此被引入以解决这一问题。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于Tsallis熵的自适应去偏方法（ADTE），通过动态调整类特定参数q^l，并结合标签调整策略，优化模型在测试时的预测置信度选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，ADTE在ImageNet及其五个变体上优于现有方法，并在10个跨域基准测试中取得了最高平均性能。

Conclusion: ADTE（自适应去偏Tsallis熵）作为一种新颖的测试时适应方法，通过引入类特定参数q^l和标签调整策略，显著提升了CLIP模型在测试时的适应性能，无需额外的分布特定超参数调优。

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

Conclusion: Code2Worlds框架通过语言到模拟代码生成的方式，成功解决了4D动态生成中的多尺度上下文纠缠和语义-物理执行差距问题，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Conclusion: Light4D提出了一种无需训练的框架，成功解决了4D视频重光照中的时间一致性和极端视角变化问题，通过解耦流指导和时序一致性注意力机制，实现了高保真度的光照效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为Targeted Smart Filtering的新方法，有效解决了3D分形生成速度慢和多样性不足的问题，显著提升了下游任务的表现。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

Conclusion: Rectified-Flow (RF) 生成模型通过提出 Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI) 和 mimic-CFG 方法，显著提升了反转稳定性、图像重建质量和编辑保真度，同时减少了神经函数评估次数，在 PIE-Bench 上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Conclusion: 研究提出的Region-to-Image Distillation方法通过将放大操作从推理时工具转化为训练时原语，显著提升了MLLM在细粒度感知任务中的性能，同时避免了高延迟问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

Result: 在多种扫描几何和解剖区域上的广泛评估表明，基于合成数据训练的模型在减少环形伪影方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于展开网络的方法，通过利用合成数据来减少CT图像中的环形伪影，无需真实临床数据即可训练模型，且在多种扫描几何和解剖区域中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 由于LGE图像标注数据有限，开发自动化分割方法面临挑战，需解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 结合隐式神经表示（INRs）和去噪扩散模型，首先生成连续的LGE数据空间表示，再通过潜在空间生成新表示并解码为合成图像和掩码。

Result: 实验显示，使用200个合成数据增强训练集后，纤维化分割的Dice分数从0.509提升至0.524。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用隐式神经表示（INRs）和去噪扩散模型合成LGE图像及分割掩码的新框架，有效缓解了数据稀缺问题，并通过实验验证了其提升分割性能的潜力。

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

Conclusion: 专有模型在手写和表单处理上表现出更高的鲁棒性，而多个开源权重系统在标准印刷布局上仍具竞争力。

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的概率优化框架和CUB-Loss方法在多种医学影像任务中表现优异，显著提升了模型的校准性和可靠性，具备实际临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在复杂空间理解和推理方面表现不足，现有方法要么计算成本高，要么空间信息丢失。

Method: 通过训练扩散模型在交错文本-坐标指令格式上增强其布局感知能力，并利用先进的MLLMs作为规划器生成全面的布局计划，直接将其空间规划能力转移到生成过程中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像生成基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并在复杂推理任务中显著优于基线方法，同时在图像编辑场景中也表现出强大的效果。

Conclusion: 论文提出的SCoT框架有效结合了MLLMs的空间推理能力和扩散模型的生成能力，显著提升了复杂空间理解和推理任务的性能，并在图像生成和编辑场景中表现出色。

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Motivation: 新生儿复苏的准确记录对质量改进和临床指南的遵循至关重要，但实践中仍未被充分利用。尽管之前的研究使用3D-CNN和Vision Transformers（ViT）在检测关键活动方面取得了一定成果，但在识别细粒度活动方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 本研究探索了局部视觉语言模型（VLM）与大语言模型（LLM）的结合使用，并与监督学习的TimeSFormer基线进行比较。使用了包含13.26小时新生儿复苏视频的模拟数据集，评估了多种零样本VLM策略及带有分类头的微调VLM（包括LoRA）。

Result: 小型（局部）VLM存在幻觉问题，但通过LoRA微调后，F1分数达到0.91，超过了TimeSFormer的0.70。

Conclusion: 生成式AI（GenAI）方法，特别是结合局部视觉语言模型（VLM）与大语言模型（LLM），在新生儿复苏视频中的活动识别上表现优于传统监督学习方法（如TimeSFormer），尤其是在微调后（如使用LoRA）F1分数达到0.91。

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于DMD的HDR成像系统，通过自适应曝光控制和区域分割，实现了127 dB的动态范围，显著减少了高光环境下的测量误差，适用于传统传感器无法胜任的光学计量场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光力学测量的准确性严重依赖于图像质量，特别是在极端光照条件下（如焊接电弧监测和抛光金属表面分析）。在这些情况下，超过120 dB的高动态范围（HDR）成像是必不可少的。传统的CCD/CMOS传感器动态范围通常低于70 dB，在高光下极易饱和，导致细节不可逆的丢失和数字图像相关（DIC）中的显著误差。

Method: 本文提出了一种利用数字微镜设备（DMD）空间调制能力的HDR成像系统。系统架构通过集成两个协同子系统（基于DMD的光学调制单元和自适应计算成像管道），实现了对高动态范围场景的自主区域分割和自适应曝光控制。

Result: 系统实现了127 dB的可测量动态范围，有效消除了高光下的饱和伪影。实验结果表明应变误差减少了78%，并提高了DIC定位精度，证实了在极端强度变化下的可靠性能。

Conclusion: 基于DMD的系统提供了高保真度的自适应HDR成像，克服了传统传感器的关键限制。在高光环境下，传统方法不足时，该系统在光学计量和应力分析中展现出强大的潜力。

Abstract: Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

Motivation: 传统VLA模型因场景理解和未来预测能力不足而受限，而视频世界模型在时空推理和未来预测方面表现优异，因此提出结合世界模型的VLA学习方法。

Method: 基于GigaBrain-0.5预训练模型，采用RAMP（世界模型条件策略强化学习）方法进行训练。

Result: RAMP方法在Laundry Folding、Box Packing和Espresso Preparation等任务上比RECAP基线提升约30%，并验证了长时程执行的可靠性。

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0.5M*通过整合世界模型和强化学习，显著提升了VLA模型在复杂任务中的表现，尤其在长时程执行任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.

Motivation: 图像到海报生成任务需要同时处理局部调整和高层次设计理解，现有方法难以兼顾实体保留和概念驱动的创作需求。

Method: PosterOmni采用高效的数据蒸馏奖励管道，包括多场景数据集构建、局部与全局专家知识蒸馏以及统一的奖励反馈机制。

Result: 实验表明，PosterOmni在参考依从性、全局构图质量和美学和谐性方面显著优于开源基线及部分专有系统。

Conclusion: PosterOmni通过整合局部编辑和全局创作，显著提升了海报生成的参考依从性、全局构图质量和美学和谐性，超越了开源基线甚至部分专有系统。

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

Motivation: 解决监督微调在未见状态下无法纠正策略漂移的问题，同时避免偏好优化方法对昂贵偏好对或奖励建模的需求。

Method: 提出了FAIL框架，包含两种算法：FAIL-PD利用可微分ODE求解器降低方差路径梯度，FAIL-PG则为离散或计算受限场景提供黑盒方案。

Result: 仅用13,000个演示样本，FAIL在提示跟随和美学基准测试中表现出竞争力，并成功应用于离散图像和视频生成。

Conclusion: FAIL框架通过对抗训练有效减少了策略与专家之间的差异，无需显式奖励或成对比较，且在离散图像和视频生成中表现出良好的泛化能力，同时可作为正则化器防止奖励优化中的奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

TL;DR: Monarch-RT是一种结构化注意力参数化方法，首次实现单GPU实时视频生成（16 FPS），显著提升效率并保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频生成在扩散变换器中因3D自注意力的二次成本而受限，尤其是在少步骤和自回归的实时场景下，错误会随时间累积，且每一步去噪需携带更多信息。

Method: 提出了Monarch-RT，一种基于Monarch矩阵的结构化注意力参数化方法，通过块结构和对齐的tiled Monarch参数化，实现了高表达性和计算效率。

Result: Monarch-RT在保持质量的同时实现了高达95%的注意力稀疏性，并在Nvidia RTX 5090、H100和B200 GPU上分别优于FlashAttention-2、3和4内核，速度提升1.4-11.8倍。

Conclusion: Monarch-RT通过其结构化的注意力参数化方法，首次实现了在单块RTX 5090上以16 FPS进行实时视频生成，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: UniT框架通过多轮推理、验证和精炼，展示了多模态测试时间扩展作为提升统一模型生成和理解能力的有效范式。

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的渐进式语义错觉方法，通过动态优化矢量笔触，成功实现了单幅草图在不同绘制阶段的语义转换，显著提升了可识别性和错觉强度。

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

Result: Filmsticking++成功重建了无法向量的点云表面，插值所有点，计算成本更低，鲁棒性和可扩展性更强。

Conclusion: Filmsticking++通过引入加权距离的受限功率图和虚拟站点，克服了传统RVD-based filmsticking的局限性，显著提升了计算效率、鲁棒性和可扩展性，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Explicit surface reconstruction aims to generate a surface mesh that exactly interpolates a given point cloud. This requirement is crucial when the point cloud must lie non-negotiably on the final surface to preserve sharp features and fine geometric details. However, the task becomes substantially challenging with low-quality point clouds, due to inherent reconstruction ambiguities compounded by combinatorial complexity. A previous method using filmsticking technique by iteratively compute restricted Voronoi diagram to address these issues, ensures to produce a watertight manifold, setting a new benchmark as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Unfortunately, RVD-based filmsticking is inability to interpolate all points in the case of deep internal cavities, resulting in very likely is the generation of faulty topology. The cause of this issue is that RVD-based filmsticking has inherent limitations due to Euclidean distance metrics. In this paper, we extend the filmsticking technique, named Filmsticking++. Filmsticking++ reconstructing an explicit surface from points without normals. On one hand, Filmsticking++ break through the inherent limitations of Euclidean distance by employing a weighted-distance-based Restricted Power Diagram, which guarantees that all points are interpolated. On the other hand, we observe that as the guiding surface increasingly approximates the target shape, the external medial axis is gradually expelled outside the guiding surface. Building on this observation, we propose placing virtual sites inside the guiding surface to accelerate the expulsion of the external medial axis from its interior. To summarize, contrary to the SOTA method, Filmsticking++ demonstrates multiple benefits, including decreases computational cost, improved robustness and scalability.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽能忠实捕捉复杂植物叶片，但其高内存占用和缺乏网格拓扑使其与传统游戏生产流程不兼容。

Method: 通过利用叶片形状的重复性，方法从无结构的3DGS中分割叶片，并选择代表性叶片组转换为薄而锐利的网格模板，然后通过可微移动最小二乘（MLS）变形将模板拟合到所有其他叶片。运行时使用顶点着色器高效评估变形以最小化存储需求。

Conclusion: LeafFit成功地将3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）转换为可编辑的网格资产，显著减少了数据大小并支持参数级编辑，优于现有基线。

Abstract: We propose LeafFit, a pipeline that converts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) of individual plants into editable, instanced mesh assets. While 3DGS faithfully captures complex foliage, its high memory footprint and lack of mesh topology make it incompatible with traditional game production workflows. We address this by leveraging the repetition of leaf shapes; our method segments leaves from the unstructured 3DGS, with optional user interaction included as a fallback. A representative leaf group is selected and converted into a thin, sharp mesh to serve as a template; this template is then fitted to all other leaves via differentiable Moving Least Squares (MLS) deformation. At runtime, the deformation is evaluated efficiently on-the-fly using a vertex shader to minimize storage requirements. Experiments demonstrate that LeafFit achieves higher segmentation quality and deformation accuracy than recent baselines while significantly reducing data size and enabling parameter-level editing.

Conclusion: VF-Editor通过前馈方式预测属性变化，实现了对3D高斯原生的直接编辑，克服了间接编辑方法的局限，展示了高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Indirect editing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently witnessed significant advancements. These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets reveal the inherent limitations of indirect editing pipelines and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

Result: OMEGA-Avatar在实验中表现出色，显著提升了360°全头完整性和身份保持能力。

Conclusion: OMEGA-Avatar在360°全头完整性和跨视角身份保持方面显著优于现有基线，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains a formidable challenge. We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints.

Our system differentiates a broad class of geometric algorithms, exploiting existing fast problem-specific schemes common to geometry processing, including local-global and ADMM solvers. It is compatible with machine learning frameworks, opening doors to new classes of inverse geometry processing applications. We marry the scatter-gather approach to mesh processing with tensor-based workflows and rely on the adjoint method applied to user-specified imperative code to generate an efficient backward pass behind the scenes. We demonstrate our approach by differentiating through mean curvature flow, spectral conformal parameterization, geodesic distance computation, and as-rigid-as-possible deformation, examining usability and performance on these applications. Our system allows practitioners to differentiate through existing geometry processing algorithms without needing to reformulate them, resulting in low implementation effort, fast runtimes, and lower memory requirements than differentiable optimization tools not tailored to geometry processing.

Conclusion: NeuroKalman框架通过解耦导航为先验预测和似然校正两个互补过程，有效减少了状态漂移问题，显著提升了UAV在复杂环境中的连续导航性能。

Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.

Conclusion: H-WM通过结合高级逻辑世界模型和低级视觉世界模型，在统一的双层框架内联合预测逻辑和视觉状态转换，有效减少误差累积，实现长时程任务的稳健执行。

Abstract: World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.

Conclusion: ExtremControl框架显著降低了人形机器人远程操作系统的延迟，支持高度响应的行为，如乒乓球平衡和杂耍，实现了端到端延迟低至50ms，远超先前工作的200ms限制。

Abstract: Building a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system is essential for collecting diverse reactive and dynamic demonstrations. However, existing approaches rely on heavily pre-processed human-to-humanoid motion retargeting and position-only PD control, resulting in substantial latency that severely limits responsiveness and prevents tasks requiring rapid feedback and fast reactions. To address this problem, we propose ExtremControl, a low latency whole-body control framework that: (1) operates directly on SE(3) poses of selected rigid links, primarily humanoid extremities, to avoid full-body retargeting; (2) utilizes a Cartesian-space mapping to directly convert human motion to humanoid link targets; and (3) incorporates velocity feedforward control at low level to support highly responsive behavior under rapidly changing control interfaces. We further provide a unified theoretical formulation of ExtremControl and systematically validate its effectiveness through experiments in both simulation and real-world environments. Building on ExtremControl, we implement a low-latency humanoid teleoperation system that supports both optical motion capture and VR-based motion tracking, achieving end-to-end latency as low as 50ms and enabling highly responsive behaviors such as ping-pong ball balancing, juggling, and real-time return, thereby substantially surpassing the 200ms latency limit observed in prior work.

Abstract: Deploying robots at scale demands robustness to the long tail of everyday situations. The countless variations in scene layout, object geometry, and task specifications that characterize real environments are vast and underrepresented in existing robot benchmarks. Measuring this level of generalization requires infrastructure at a scale and diversity that physical evaluation alone cannot provide. We introduce MolmoSpaces, a fully open ecosystem to support large-scale benchmarking of robot policies. MolmoSpaces consists of over 230k diverse indoor environments, ranging from handcrafted household scenes to procedurally generated multiroom houses, populated with 130k richly annotated object assets, including 48k manipulable objects with 42M stable grasps. Crucially, these environments are simulator-agnostic, supporting popular options such as MuJoCo, Isaac, and ManiSkill. The ecosystem supports the full spectrum of embodied tasks: static and mobile manipulation, navigation, and multiroom long-horizon tasks requiring coordinated perception, planning, and interaction across entire indoor environments. We also design MolmoSpaces-Bench, a benchmark suite of 8 tasks in which robots interact with our diverse scenes and richly annotated objects. Our experiments show MolmoSpaces-Bench exhibits strong sim-to-real correlation (R = 0.96, \r{ho} = 0.98), confirm newer and stronger zero-shot policies outperform earlier versions in our benchmarks, and identify key sensitivities to prompt phrasing, initial joint positions, and camera occlusion. Through MolmoSpaces and its open-source assets and tooling, we provide a foundation for scalable data generation, policy training, and benchmark creation for robot learning research.

Abstract: We present an approach to robot learning from egocentric human videos by modeling human preferences in a reward function and optimizing robot behavior to maximize this reward. Prior work on reward learning from human videos attempts to measure the long-term value of a visual state as the temporal distance between it and the terminal state in a demonstration video. These approaches make assumptions that limit performance when learning from video. They must also transfer the learned value function across the embodiment and environment gap. Our method models human preferences by learning to predict the motion of tracked points between subsequent images and defines a reward function as the agreement between predicted and observed object motion in a robot's behavior at each step. We then use a modified Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm initialized with 10 on-robot demonstrations to estimate a value function from this reward and optimize a policy that maximizes this value function, all on the robot. Our approach is capable of learning on a real robot, and we show that policies learned with our reward model match or outperform prior work across multiple tasks in both simulation and on the real robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人模仿学习中大规模真实数据收集成本高的问题，特别是针对家用低成本机器人，需兼顾用户友好性和经济性。

Method: 从标准RGB摄像头捕获的人类视频演示中提取3D手部轨迹，通过动作对齐模块映射到低成本机器人的夹爪控制空间，并引入手部视觉增强策略以弥合人机领域差距，最后通过协同训练方法在少量机器人数据上进行微调。

Result: 在低成本LeRobot平台上的实验表明，EasyMimic在各种操作任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EasyMimic框架通过低成本、可复制的解决方案，显著减少了对昂贵机器人数据收集的依赖，为智能机器人进入家庭提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Robot imitation learning is often hindered by the high cost of collecting large-scale, real-world data. This challenge is especially significant for low-cost robots designed for home use, as they must be both user-friendly and affordable. To address this, we propose the EasyMimic framework, a low-cost and replicable solution that enables robots to quickly learn manipulation policies from human video demonstrations captured with standard RGB cameras. Our method first extracts 3D hand trajectories from the videos. An action alignment module then maps these trajectories to the gripper control space of a low-cost robot. To bridge the human-to-robot domain gap, we introduce a simple and user-friendly hand visual augmentation strategy. We then use a co-training method, fine-tuning a model on both the processed human data and a small amount of robot data, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. Experiments on the low-cost LeRobot platform demonstrate that EasyMimic achieves high performance across various manipulation tasks. It significantly reduces the reliance on expensive robot data collection, offering a practical path for bringing intelligent robots into homes.

*Raihan Islam Arnob,Max Merlin,Abhishek Paudel,Benned Hedegaard,George Konidaris,Gregory Stein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于LIOS动作的规划框架，有效解决了在未知环境中任务规划的问题，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人的任务规划通常假设环境知识完整，因此流行的规划方法（如通过PDDL规划）在任务关键对象位置未知时无法规划。最近的学习驱动对象搜索方法有效，但作为独立工具运行，不易融入完整的任务规划器中，后者还需确定哪些对象是必要的以及何时在计划中寻找它们。

Method: 开发了一个规划框架，围绕新型基于模型的LIOS动作，这些动作作为策略旨在寻找和检索单个对象。高层规划将LIOS动作视为确定性动作，并通过基于模型计算每个动作的预期成本，生成交织搜索和执行的计划。

Result: 在模拟的ProcTHOR家庭和现实世界中，该方法在包括检索和餐前准备等任务上优于非学习和学习基线。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一个围绕新型基于模型的LIOS动作的规划框架，这些动作作为策略旨在寻找和检索单个对象。高层规划将LIOS动作视为确定性动作，并通过基于模型计算每个动作的预期成本，生成交织搜索和执行的计划，实现了有效、可靠且完整的学习知情任务规划，尽管存在不确定性。

Abstract: Task planning for mobile robots often assumes full environment knowledge and so popular approaches, like planning via the PDDL, cannot plan when the locations of task-critical objects are unknown. Recent learning-driven object search approaches are effective, but operate as standalone tools and so are not straightforwardly incorporated into full task planners, which must additionally determine both what objects are necessary and when in the plan they should be sought out. To address this limitation, we develop a planning framework centered around novel model-based LIOS actions: each a policy that aims to find and retrieve a single object. High-level planning treats LIOS actions as deterministic and so -- informed by model-based calculations of the expected cost of each -- generates plans that interleave search and execution for effective, sound, and complete learning-informed task planning despite uncertainty. Our work effectively reasons about uncertainty while maintaining compatibility with existing full-knowledge solvers. In simulated ProcTHOR homes and in the real world, our approach outperforms non-learned and learned baselines on tasks including retrieval and meal prep.

TL;DR: HyperDet通过多帧聚合、一致性验证和扩散模块优化4D雷达点云，提升雷达检测性能，无需修改检测器架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达具有天气鲁棒性和成本效益，但其点云稀疏、不规则且易受多径噪声影响，导致3D检测性能落后于LiDAR。

Method: HyperDet通过多帧雷达点云聚合、几何感知的跨传感器一致性验证以及前景聚焦的扩散模块，结合雷达-LiDAR混合监督训练，构建任务感知的超4D雷达点云。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上，HyperDet显著提升了基于VoxelNeXt和CenterPoint的雷达检测性能，部分缩小了雷达与LiDAR的差距。

Conclusion: HyperDet通过输入级优化，使4D毫米波雷达能够更好地利用面向LiDAR的检测器，无需架构修改，部分缩小了雷达与LiDAR之间的性能差距。

Abstract: 4D mmWave radar provides weather-robust, velocity-aware measurements and is more cost-effective than LiDAR. However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉导航模型在动态环境中表现不佳，主要受限于仿真到现实的差距以及缺乏针对目标部署环境的定制化训练策略。尽管3D高斯泼溅（GS）技术可缓解此问题，但先前研究仅考虑静态场景或不切实际的动态障碍物。

Method: ReaDy-Go 包含三个核心组件：动态GS模拟器（整合场景GS与人类动画模块）、动态环境导航数据集生成（利用模拟器、机器人专家规划器和人类规划器）、以及基于生成数据集的策略学习。

Result: ReaDy-Go 在仿真和真实实验中均优于基线方法，即使在仿真到现实转移和存在移动障碍物的情况下仍表现优异，且在未见过的环境中展示了零样本泛化潜力。

Conclusion: ReaDy-Go 通过结合静态场景重建与动态人类障碍物，生成了逼真的动态环境导航数据集，显著提升了导航策略在仿真到现实转移中的鲁棒性，并在真实环境中展示了优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual navigation models often struggle in real-world dynamic environments due to limited robustness to the sim-to-real gap and the difficulty of training policies tailored to target deployment environments (e.g., households, restaurants, and factories). Although real-to-sim navigation simulation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) can mitigate this gap, prior works have assumed only static scenes or unrealistic dynamic obstacles, despite the importance of safe navigation in dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose ReaDy-Go, a novel real-to-sim simulation pipeline that synthesizes photorealistic dynamic scenarios for target environments. ReaDy-Go generates photorealistic navigation datasets for dynamic environments by combining a reconstructed static GS scene with dynamic human GS obstacles, and trains policies robust to both the sim-to-real gap and moving obstacles. The pipeline consists of three components: (1) a dynamic GS simulator that integrates scene GS with a human animation module, enabling the insertion of animatable human GS avatars and the synthesis of plausible human motions from 2D trajectories, (2) navigation dataset generation for dynamic environments that leverages the simulator, a robot expert planner designed for dynamic GS representations, and a human planner, and (3) policy learning using the generated datasets. ReaDy-Go outperforms baselines across target environments in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved navigation performance even after sim-to-real transfer and in the presence of moving obstacles. Moreover, zero-shot sim-to-real deployment in an unseen environment indicates its generalization potential. Project page: https://syeon-yoo.github.io/ready-go-site/.

Abstract: Tactile information plays a crucial role in human manipulation tasks and has recently garnered increasing attention in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches mostly focus on the alignment of visual and tactile features and the integration mechanism tends to be direct concatenation. Consequently, they struggle to effectively cope with occluded scenarios due to neglecting the inherent complementary nature of both modalities and the alignment may not be exploited enough, limiting the potential of their real-world deployment. In this paper, we present ViTaS, a simple yet effective framework that incorporates both visual and tactile information to guide the behavior of an agent. We introduce Soft Fusion Contrastive Learning, an advanced version of conventional contrastive learning method and a CVAE module to utilize the alignment and complementarity within visuo-tactile representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 12 simulated and 3 real-world environments, and our experiments show that ViTaS significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Motivation: 社交机器人需要更自然地模拟人类视线行为，尤其是在面对非人类刺激时的反应，这是先前研究中被忽视的关键领域。

Method: 研究使用Unity软件模拟了3D动画和360度真实世界视频场景，收集了41名参与者的视线数据，并利用LSTM和Transformer神经网络构建预测模型。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提升机器人对人类和非人类刺激的视线行为模拟能力，显著增强了社交机器人在复杂社交环境中的互动效果，为社交机器人领域提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Nonverbal behaviors, particularly gaze direction, play a crucial role in enhancing effective communication in social interactions. As social robots increasingly participate in these interactions, they must adapt their gaze based on human activities and remain receptive to all cues, whether human-generated or not, to ensure seamless and effective communication. This study aims to increase the similarity between robot and human gaze behavior across various social situations, including both human and non-human stimuli (e.g., conversations, pointing, door openings, and object drops). A key innovation in this study, is the investigation of gaze responses to non-human stimuli, a critical yet underexplored area in prior research. These scenarios, were simulated in the Unity software as a 3D animation and a 360-degree real-world video. Data on gaze directions from 41 participants were collected via virtual reality (VR) glasses. Preprocessed data, trained two neural networks-LSTM and Transformer-to build predictive models based on individuals' gaze patterns. In the animated scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved prediction accuracies of 67.6% and 70.4%, respectively; In the real-world scenario, the LSTM and Transformer models achieved accuracies of 72% and 71.6%, respectively. Despite the gaze pattern differences among individuals, our models outperform existing approaches in accuracy while uniquely considering non-human stimuli, offering a significant advantage over previous literature. Furthermore, deployed on the NAO robot, the system was evaluated by 275 participants via a comprehensive questionnaire, with results demonstrating high satisfaction during interactions. This work advances social robotics by enabling robots to dynamically mimic human gaze behavior in complex social contexts.

Abstract: Cooperative path planning for heterogeneous UAV swarms poses significant challenges for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in handling asymmetric inter-agent dependencies and addressing the risks of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes an attentive curriculum learning framework (AC-MASAC). The framework introduces a role-aware heterogeneous attention mechanism to explicitly model asymmetric dependencies. Moreover, a structured curriculum strategy is designed, integrating hierarchical knowledge transfer and stage-proportional experience replay to address the issues of sparse rewards and catastrophic forgetting. The proposed framework is validated on a custom multi-agent simulation platform, and the results show that our method has significant advantages over other advanced methods in terms of Success Rate, Formation Keeping Rate, and Success-weighted Mission Time.

Conclusion: HAIC框架通过动态预测器和几何先验的结合，成功解决了人形机器人与不同动态物体交互时的控制挑战，尤其在非完整约束和遮挡条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.

Conclusion: LAMP 是一种新型的神经语言场导航框架，通过结合隐式神经场和稀疏图，显著提高了大环境中的内存效率和精细路径规划精度。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have made zero-shot navigation feasible, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions without requiring labeling. However, existing methods that explicitly store language vectors in grid or node-based maps struggle to scale to large environments due to excessive memory requirements and limited resolution for fine-grained planning. We introduce LAMP (Language Map), a novel neural language field-based navigation framework that learns a continuous, language-driven map and directly leverages it for fine-grained path generation. Unlike prior approaches, our method encodes language features as an implicit neural field rather than storing them explicitly at every location. By combining this implicit representation with a sparse graph, LAMP supports efficient coarse path planning and then performs gradient-based optimization in the learned field to refine poses near the goal. This coarse-to-fine pipeline, language-driven, gradient-guided optimization is the first application of an implicit language map for precise path generation. This refinement is particularly effective at selecting goal regions not directly observed by leveraging semantic similarities in the learned feature space. To further enhance robustness, we adopt a Bayesian framework that models embedding uncertainty via the von Mises-Fisher distribution, thereby improving generalization to unobserved regions. To scale to large environments, LAMP employs a graph sampling strategy that prioritizes spatial coverage and embedding confidence, retaining only the most informative nodes and substantially reducing computational overhead. Our experimental results, both in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and on a real multi-floor building, demonstrate that LAMP outperforms existing explicit methods in both memory efficiency and fine-grained goal-reaching accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based policies show limited generalization in semantic manipulation, posing a key obstacle to the deployment of real-world robots. This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.

Conclusion: FAST框架通过Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation和Center-of-Mass-Aware Control，显著提升了人形机器人在高动态场景中的适应性和稳定性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Learning a general whole-body controller for humanoid robots remains challenging due to the diversity of motion distributions, the difficulty of fast adaptation, and the need for robust balance in high-dynamic scenarios. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or suffer from performance degradation when adapting to new motions. In this paper, we present FAST, a general humanoid whole-body control framework that enables Fast Adaptation and Stable Motion Tracking. FAST introduces Parseval-Guided Residual Policy Adaptation, which learns a lightweight delta action policy under orthogonality and KL constraints, enabling efficient adaptation to out-of-distribution motions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further improve physical robustness, we propose Center-of-Mass-Aware Control, which incorporates CoM-related observations and objectives to enhance balance when tracking challenging reference motions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world deployment demonstrate that FAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in robustness, adaptation efficiency, and generalization.

Abstract: We hypothesize that a key bottleneck in generalizable robot manipulation is not solely data scale or policy capacity, but a structural mismatch between current visual backbones and the physical requirements of closed-loop control. While state-of-the-art vision encoders (including those used in VLAs) optimize for semantic invariance to stabilize classification, manipulation typically demands geometric sensitivity the ability to map millimeter-level pose shifts to predictable feature changes. Their discriminative objective creates a "blind spot" for fine-grained control, whereas generative diffusion models inherently encode geometric dependencies within their latent manifolds, encouraging the preservation of dense multi-scale spatial structure. However, directly deploying stochastic diffusion features for control is hindered by stochastic instability, inference latency, and representation drift during fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we propose Robot-DIFT, a framework that decouples the source of geometric information from the process of inference via Manifold Distillation. By distilling a frozen diffusion teacher into a deterministic Spatial-Semantic Feature Pyramid Network (S2-FPN), we retain the rich geometric priors of the generative model while ensuring temporal stability, real-time execution, and robustness against drift. Pretrained on the large-scale DROID dataset, Robot-DIFT demonstrates superior geometric consistency and control performance compared to leading discriminative baselines, supporting the view that how a model learns to see dictates how well it can learn to act.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial-surface robot teams are promising for maritime monitoring. Robust deployment requires reliable perception over reflective water and scalable coordination under limited communication. We present a decentralized multi-robot framework for detecting and tracking floating containers using multiple UAVs cooperating with an autonomous surface vessel. Each UAV performs YOLOv8 and stereo-disparity-based visual detection, then tracks targets with per-object EKFs using uncertainty-aware data association. Compact track summaries are exchanged and fused conservatively via covariance intersection, ensuring consistency under unknown correlations. An information-driven assignment module allocates targets and selects UAV hover viewpoints by trading expected uncertainty reduction against travel effort and safety separation. Simulation results in a maritime scenario demonstrate improved coverage, localization accuracy, and tracking consistency while maintaining modest communication requirements.

Abstract: MAPF is a core coordination problem for large robot fleets in automated warehouses and logistics. Existing approaches are typically either open-loop planners, which generate fixed trajectories and struggle to handle disturbances, or closed-loop heuristics without reliable performance guarantees, limiting their use in safety-critical deployments. This paper presents ACCBS, a closed-loop algorithm built on a finite-horizon variant of CBS with a horizon-changing mechanism inspired by iterative deepening in MPC. ACCBS dynamically adjusts the planning horizon based on the available computational budget, and reuses a single constraint tree to enable seamless transitions between horizons. As a result, it produces high-quality feasible solutions quickly while being asymptotically optimal as the budget increases, exhibiting anytime behavior. Extensive case studies demonstrate that ACCBS combines flexibility to disturbances with strong performance guarantees, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical robustness for large-scale robot deployment.

Abstract: Proprioceptive information is critical for precise servo control by providing real-time robotic states. Its collaboration with vision is highly expected to enhance performances of the manipulation policy in complex tasks. However, recent studies have reported inconsistent observations on the generalization of vision-proprioception policies. In this work, we investigate this by conducting temporally controlled experiments. We found that during task sub-phases that robot's motion transitions, which require target localization, the vision modality of the vision-proprioception policy plays a limited role. Further analysis reveals that the policy naturally gravitates toward concise proprioceptive signals that offer faster loss reduction when training, thereby dominating the optimization and suppressing the learning of the visual modality during motion-transition phases. To alleviate this, we propose the Gradient Adjustment with Phase-guidance (GAP) algorithm that adaptively modulates the optimization of proprioception, enabling dynamic collaboration within the vision-proprioception policy. Specifically, we leverage proprioception to capture robotic states and estimate the probability of each timestep in the trajectory belonging to motion-transition phases. During policy learning, we apply fine-grained adjustment that reduces the magnitude of proprioception's gradient based on estimated probabilities, leading to robust and generalizable vision-proprioception policies. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate GAP is applicable in both simulated and real-world environments, across one-arm and dual-arm setups, and compatible with both conventional and Vision-Language-Action models. We believe this work can offer valuable insights into the development of vision-proprioception policies in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

Abstract: Training robotic policies directly in the real world is expensive and unscalable. Although generative simulation enables large-scale data synthesis, current approaches often fail to generate logically coherent long-horizon tasks and struggle with dynamic physical uncertainties due to open-loop execution. To address these challenges, we propose Affordance-Graphed Task Worlds (AGT-World), a unified framework that autonomously constructs interactive simulated environments and corresponding robot task policies based on real-world observations. Unlike methods relying on random proposals or static replication, AGT-World formalizes the task space as a structured graph, enabling the precise, hierarchical decomposition of complex goals into theoretically grounded atomic primitives. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Evolution mechanism with hybrid feedback to autonomously refine policies, combining Vision-Language Model reasoning and geometric verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms in success rates and generalization, achieving a self-improving cycle of proposal, execution, and correction for scalable robot learning.

Abstract: Reliable coordination and efficient communication are critical challenges for multi-agent robotic exploration of environments where communication is limited. This work introduces Adaptive-RF Transmission (ART), a novel communication-aware planning algorithm that dynamically modulates transmission location based on signal strength and data payload size, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to share information efficiently without unnecessary backtracking. We further explore an extension to this approach called ART-SST, which enforces signal strength thresholds for high-fidelity data delivery. Through over 480 simulations across three cave-inspired environments, ART consistently outperforms existing strategies, including full rendezvous and minimum-signal heuristic approaches, achieving up to a 58% reduction in distance traveled and up to 52% faster exploration times compared to baseline methods. These results demonstrate that adaptive, payload-aware communication significantly improves coverage efficiency and mission speed in complex, communication-constrained environments, offering a promising foundation for future planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: The automation of warehouse operations is crucial for improving productivity and reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. One operation frequently performed in warehouses is bin-packing where items need to be placed into containers, either for delivery to a customer, or for temporary storage in the warehouse. Whilst prior bin-packing works have largely been focused on packing items into empty containers and have adopted collision-free strategies, it is often the case that containers will already be partially filled with items, often in suboptimal arrangements due to transportation about a warehouse. This paper presents a contact-aware packing approach that exploits purposeful interactions with previously placed objects to create free space and enable successful placement of new items. This is achieved by using a contact-based multi-object trajectory optimizer within a model predictive controller, integrated with a physics-aware perception system that estimates object poses even during inevitable occlusions, and a method that suggests physically-feasible locations to place the object inside the container.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning for high-dimensional robotic systems, such as manipulators and mobile manipulators, is critical for real-time operation and reliable deployment. Although advances in planning algorithms have enhanced scalability to high-dimensional state spaces, these improvements often come at the cost of generating unpredictable, inconsistent motions or requiring excessive computational resources and memory. In this work, we introduce Multi-Graph Search (MGS), a search-based motion planning algorithm that generalizes classical unidirectional and bidirectional search to a multi-graph setting. MGS maintains and incrementally expands multiple implicit graphs over the state space, focusing exploration on high-potential regions while allowing initially disconnected subgraphs to be merged through feasible transitions as the search progresses. We prove that MGS is complete and bounded-suboptimal, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of manipulation and mobile manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Object navigation is a core capability of embodied intelligence, enabling an agent to locate target objects in unknown environments. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have facilitated zero-shot object navigation (ZSON). However, existing methods often rely on scene abstractions that convert environments into semantic maps or textual representations, causing high-level decision making to be constrained by the accuracy of low-level perception. In this work, we present 3DGSNav, a novel ZSON framework that embeds 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as persistent memory for VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Through active perception, 3DGSNav incrementally constructs a 3DGS representation of the environment, enabling trajectory-guided free-viewpoint rendering of frontier-aware first-person views. Moreover, we design structured visual prompts and integrate them with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to further improve VLM reasoning. During navigation, a real-time object detector filters potential targets, while VLM-driven active viewpoint switching performs target re-verification, ensuring efficient and reliable recognition. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and real-world experiments on a quadruped robot demonstrate that our method achieves robust and competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.The Project Page:https://aczheng-cai.github.io/3dgsnav.github.io/

Abstract: We propose a geometric model for optimal shape-change-induced motions of slender locomotors, e.g., snakes slithering on sand. In these scenarios, the motion of a body in world coordinates is completely determined by the sequence of shapes it assumes. Specifically, we formulate Lagrangian least-dissipation principles as boundary value problems whose solutions are given by sub-Riemannian geodesics. Notably, our geometric model accounts not only for the energy dissipated by the body's displacement through the environment, but also for the energy dissipated by the animal's metabolism or a robot's actuators to induce shape changes such as bending and stretching, thus capturing overall locomotion efficiency. Our continuous model, together with a consistent time and space discretization, enables numerical computation of sub-Riemannian geodesics for three different types of boundary conditions, i.e., fixing initial and target body, restricting to cyclic motion, or solely prescribing body displacement and orientation. The resulting optimal deformation gaits qualitatively match observed motion trajectories of organisms such as snakes and spermatozoa, as well as known optimality results for low-dimensional systems such as Purcell's swimmers. Moreover, being geometrically less rigid than previous frameworks, our model enables new insights into locomotion mechanisms of, e.g., generalized Purcell's swimmers. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.

Motivation: 解决大规模家庭环境中因环境规模、计划长度、指令模糊性和约束复杂性导致的性能下降问题。

Method: AHAT利用LLM将任务指令和场景图映射为PDDL子目标，并通过TGPO算法增强模型分解复杂意图的能力。

Result: 实验表明，AHAT在人类风格的家庭任务中显著优于现有方法，特别是在需要复杂执行计划的简短指令场景中。

Conclusion: AHAT通过结合LLM和符号推理，显著提升了在大型家庭环境中处理模糊指令和复杂约束的任务规划能力。

Abstract: Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision-Language-Action模型生成的指令与动作之间的不对齐问题，缩小“意图-动作差距”。

Method: 提出了CoVer对比验证器，利用测试时扩展定律，结合重述指令和生成动作的多样性，通过分层验证推理流程优化动作选择。

Result: 在SIMPLER基准测试中，验证方法比策略预训练提高了22%（分布内）和13%（分布外），真实世界实验提升45%；在PolaRiS基准测试中，任务进度和成功率分别提升14%和9%。

Conclusion: CoVer框架通过测试时验证显著缩小了意图与动作之间的差距，在多个基准测试中表现出色，尤其是在真实世界实验中效果更为显著。

Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.

TL;DR: SAFuzz是一个结合LLM的自适应模糊测试框架，显著提升算法漏洞检测效率和精确度，同时与单元测试方法结合可进一步提高召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试框架难以应对AI生成代码的高产量，传统模糊测试技术资源分配不均且缺乏对算法漏洞模式的语义理解，导致资源使用效率低下和漏洞遗漏。

Method: SAFuzz整合了基于提示的行为多样化、特定问题预言机的harness生成以及基于LLM的预测器，实现了自适应资源分配和动态早期停止。

Result: 在CSES算法问题上评估SAFuzz，漏洞鉴别精确度从77.9%提升至85.7%，时间成本减少1.71倍，同时保持可比的召回率。结合现有单元测试方法后，漏洞检测召回率从67.3%提升至79.5%。

Conclusion: SAFuzz框架通过结合LLM引导的自适应模糊测试，显著提高了算法漏洞检测的效率和精确度，同时与现有单元测试方法结合还能进一步提升漏洞检测的召回率。

Abstract: While AI-coding assistants accelerate software development, current testing frameworks struggle to keep pace with the resulting volume of AI-generated code. Traditional fuzzing techniques often allocate resources uniformly and lack semantic awareness of algorithmic vulnerability patterns, leading to inefficient resource usage and missed vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid testing framework that leverages LLM-guided adaptive fuzzing to detect algorithmic vulnerabilities efficiently. Our system SAFuzz integrates prompt-based behavioral diversification, harness generation with problem-specific oracles, and an LLM-based predictor to enable adaptive resource allocation and dynamic early stopping. Evaluating SAFuzz on CSES algorithmic problems, we improve vulnerability discrimination precision from 77.9% to 85.7% and achieve a 1.71x reduction in time cost compared to SOTA GreenFuzz while maintaining comparable recall. We further observe that combining our approach with existing unit test generation methods yields complementary gains, increasing the bug detection recall from 67.3% to 79.5%.

TL;DR: SWE-MiniSandbox 是一种轻量级、无容器的强化学习训练方法，显著降低资源开销，性能与容器化方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于容器的强化学习训练方法存在存储开销大、环境设置慢和需要容器管理权限等问题，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SWE-MiniSandbox 采用内核级隔离机制和轻量级环境预缓存技术，替代传统的容器化方法。

Result: SWE-MiniSandbox 将磁盘使用降低至容器方法的约5%，环境准备时间缩短至约25%，且性能与容器化方法相当。

Conclusion: SWE-MiniSandbox 提供了一种轻量级、无容器的解决方案，显著降低了资源消耗，同时保持了与容器化方法相当的性能，为资源受限的研究环境提供了实用的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training software engineering (SWE) agents, but existing pipelines typically rely on per-task containers for isolation. At scale, pre-built container images incur substantial storage overhead, slow environment setup, and require container-management privileges. We propose SWE-MiniSandbox, a lightweight, container-free method that enables scalable RL training of SWE agents without sacrificing isolation. Instead of relying on per-instance containers, SWE-MiniSandbox executes each task in an isolated workspace backed by kernel-level mechanisms, substantially reducing system overhead. It leverages lightweight environment pre-caching techniques to eliminate the need for bulky container images. As a result, our approach lowers disk usage to approximately 5\% of that required by container-based pipelines and reduces environment preparation time to about 25\% of the container baseline. Empirical results demonstrate that SWE-MiniSandbox achieves evaluation performance comparable to standard container-based pipelines. By removing the dependency on heavy container infrastructure, SWE-MiniSandbox offers a practical and accessible foundation for scaling RL-based SWE agents, particularly in resource-constrained research environments.

Abstract: Chronic diseases constitute the principal burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide, yet current health systems remain fragmented and predominantly reactive. Patient Medical Digital Twins (PMDTs) offer a paradigm shift: holistic, continuously updated digital counterparts of patients that integrate clinical, genomic, lifestyle, and quality-of-life data. We report early implementations of PMDTs via ontology-driven modeling and federated analytics pilots. Insights from the QUALITOP oncology study and a distributed AI platform confirm both feasibility and challenges: aligning with HL7 FHIR and OMOP standards, embedding privacy governance, scaling federated queries, and designing intuitive clinician interfaces. We also highlight technical gains, such as automated reasoning over multimodal blueprints and predictive analytics for patient outcomes. By reflecting on these experiences, we outline actionable insights for software engineers and identify opportunities, such as DSLs and model-driven engineering, to advance PMDTs toward trustworthy, adaptive chronic care ecosystems.

Motivation: 代理型LLM的性能因模型、外部工具访问、提示结构和代理框架的差异而变化，需要一个既能控制软件环境变化又具有生态效度的评估框架。

Method: 提出了状态差异合约和统一沙盒的创新方法，通过标准化脚本层执行代码，评估不同LLM在真实API接口上的表现。

Conclusion: Agent-Diff框架通过结合真实API接口和沙盒环境，提供了一种新颖的评估方法，能够标准化不同代理型LLM在真实任务中的表现，并通过状态差异合约和统一沙盒实现了高效评估。

Abstract: We present Agent-Diff, a novel benchmarking framework for evaluating agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on real-world tasks that execute code via external APIs. Agentic LLM performance varies due to differences in models, external tool access, prompt structures, and agentic frameworks. Benchmarks must make fundamental trade-offs between a sandboxed approach that controls for variation in software environments and more ecologically valid approaches employing real services. Agent-Diff attempts to capture the desirable features of both of these approaches by including access to the real API interfaces for software services while sandboxing the environment in which calls are made, processed, and evaluated. This approach relies on two key innovations. The first is a novel state-diff contract, which separates process from outcome - rather than fuzzy trace or parameter matching, we define task success as whether the expected change in environment state was achieved. The second is a novel sandbox that provides a standardized scripting layer that all models use to execute code against external APIs (Slack, Box, Linear, Google Calendar). Thus, we can evaluate different agentic LLMs against a standardized set of contracts using a unified sandbox while still evaluating their performance on real-world service interfaces. Using the Agent-Diff framework, we provide benchmarks for nine LLMs across 224 tasks utilizing enterprise software workflows. In addition, we evaluate the robustness of the framework with ablation experiments to assess the contribution of access to API documentation on benchmark performance.

*Yang Liu,Armstrong Foundjem,Xingfang Wu,Heng Li,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed data boosts robustness but slightly reduces performance, highlighting the need to balance both aspects for coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the fast-paced evolution of software development, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for tasks such as code generation, completion, analysis, and bug fixing. Ensuring the robustness of these models against potential vulnerabilities from handling diverse inputs is critical, as variations in input can lead to incorrect or insecure code outputs.

Method: We systematically evaluated LLM robustness by fine-tuning models using datasets perturbed at character-level, word-level, and sentence-level, comparing results against base models and models fine-tuned on unperturbed datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs with perturbed datasets significantly improves model robustness (RD usually drops around 4% - 6%), especially for models with relatively weak robustness. However, this fine-tuning process typically results in a slight performance decrease (pass@1 usually drops around 1% - 3%) compared to fine-tuning with unperturbed datasets, although occasional performance improvements are observed.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs for coding tasks with perturbed data effectively enhances their robustness at the cost of a minor performance reduction, emphasizing the importance of balancing the robustness and performance of LLMs for coding applications.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个基于专业开发者和直播编码者实践的调试理论，强调了调试作为一种结构化的、迭代的诊断过程，开发者通过更新系统的心智模型来指导信息收集。这一理论对工具设计和软件工程教育有重要启示。

Abstract: Debugging is a central yet complex activity in software engineering. Prior studies have documented debugging strategies and tool usage, but little theory explains how experienced developers reason about bugs in large, real-world codebases. We conducted a qualitative study using a grounded theory approach. We observed seven professional developers and five professional live-coding streamers working on 17 debugging tasks in their own codebases, capturing diverse contexts of debugging. We theorize debugging as a structured, iterative diagnostic process in which programmers update a mental model of the system to guide information gathering. Developers gather information by alternating between navigation and execution strategies, employing forward and backward tracing modes of reasoning and adapting these approaches according to codebase context, complexity, and familiarity. Developers also gather external resources to complement code-based evidence, with their experience enabling them to systematically construct a mental model. We contribute a grounded theory of professional debugging that surfaces the human-centered dimensions of the practice, with implications for tool design and software engineering education.

Motivation: 开源软件社区管理者在监控活动和协作动态时面临挑战，现有工具仅提供回顾性而非预测性洞察，无法早期识别潜在的脱离行为。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括半结构化访谈、多声文献综述和社区调查，通过迭代的构建-评估周期开发并优化了留存风险诊断和参与策略。

Result: 研究提供了（1）关于OSS贡献者留存管理挑战的实证见解，（2）支持OSS社区管理者留存努力的可操作策略，以及（3）未来研究开发或验证OSS可持续性理论的实用框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为开源软件（OSS）社区管理者提供了实用的框架和策略，以改善贡献者留存管理，并为未来关于OSS可持续性的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) community managers face significant challenges in retaining contributors, as they must monitor activity and engagement while navigating complex dynamics of collaboration. Current tools designed for managing contributor retention (e.g., dashboards) fall short by providing retrospective rather than predictive insights to identify potential disengagement early. Without understanding how to anticipate and prevent disengagement, new solutions risk burdening community managers rather than supporting retention management. Following the Design Science Research paradigm, we employed a mixed-methods approach for problem identification and solution design to address contributor retention. To identify the challenges hindering retention management in OSS, we conducted semi-structured interviews, a multi-vocal literature review, and community surveys. Then through an iterative build-evaluate cycle, we developed and refined strategies for diagnosing retention risks and informing engagement efforts. We operationalized these strategies into a web-based prototype, incorporating feedback from 100+ OSS practitioners, and conducted an in situ evaluation across two OSS communities. Our study offers (1) empirical insights into the challenges of contributor retention management in OSS, (2) actionable strategies that support OSS community managers' retention efforts, and (3) a practical framework for future research in developing or validating theories about OSS sustainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量子软件测试方法依赖于简单的测试输入和统计预言机，程序规范成本高，且在真实量子计算机上的验证有限。SB-QOPS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SB-QOPS通过重新定义测试用例为Pauli字符串，并引入基于测量的预言机，利用其交换性质，减少了完整程序规范的需求。通过基于期望值的适应度函数系统探索搜索空间，提高了测试预算的利用率和发现细微故障的可能性。

Result: SB-QOPS在多达29个量子比特的电路上实现了100%的故障检测分数，并在模拟和真实噪声条件下评估了三种搜索策略，展示了跨平台的性能。

Conclusion: SB-QOPS显著优于QOPS，在多达29个量子比特的电路上实现了100%的故障检测分数，并展示了跨量子计算平台的可移植性。

Abstract: Quantum software testing is important for reliable quantum software engineering. Despite recent advances, existing quantum software testing approaches rely on simple test inputs and statistical oracles, costly program specifications, and limited validation on real quantum computers. To address these challenges, we propose SB-QOPS, a search-based quantum program testing approach via commuting Pauli strings. SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions. Experiments span three quantum computing platforms: IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum. Results show that SB-QOPS significantly outperforms QOPS, achieving a fault-detection score of 100% for circuits up to 29 qubits, and demonstrating portability across quantum platforms.

TL;DR: Hydra是一个仓库级代码生成框架，通过结构感知索引和混合检索机制解决现有方法在跨文件依赖和结构上下文上的不足，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的方法在仓库级代码生成中效果不佳，因代码块划分导致连贯性丢失且忽略结构关系，相似性驱动方法常遗漏功能相关依赖。

Method: Hydra采用结构感知索引策略（将仓库表示为函数、类和变量的层次树）、轻量级依赖感知检索器（DAR）以及混合检索机制（结合DAR与基于相似性的检索）。

Result: 在DevEval和RepoExec基准测试中，Hydra实现了最先进性能，Pass@1指标超过最强基线5%以上。

Conclusion: Hydra框架在仓库级代码生成任务中表现出色，不仅超越了现有基线模型，还能让较小模型达到或超过依赖现有检索器的大型模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models for code (CodeLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in standalone code completion and generation, sometimes even surpassing human performance, yet their effectiveness diminishes in repository-level settings where cross-file dependencies and structural context are essential. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches often borrow strategies from NLP, relying on chunking-based indexing and similarity-based retrieval. Chunking results in the loss of coherence between code units and overlooks structural relationships, while similarity-driven methods frequently miss functionally relevant dependencies such as helper functions, classes, or global variables. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a repository-level code generation framework that treats code as structured code rather than natural language. Our approach introduces (i) a structure-aware indexing strategy that represents repositories as hierarchical trees of functions, classes, and variables, preserving code structure and dependencies, (ii) a lightweight dependency-aware retriever (DAR) that explicitly identifies and retrieves the true dependencies required by a target function, and (iii) a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines DAR with similarity-based retrieval to provide both essential building blocks and practical usage examples. Extensive experiments on the challenging DevEval and RepoExec benchmarks, both requiring function implementation from real-world repositories with complex large repository context, show that Hydra achieves state-of-the-art performance across open- and closed-source CodeLLMs. Notably, our method establishes a new state of the art in repository-level code generation, surpassing strongest baseline by over 5% in Pass@1 and even enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger ones that rely on existing retrievers.

Motivation: 当前的开源项目推荐系统主要关注技术属性，忽视了影响贡献者加入和留任的协作和社区因素。

Method: 通过在线调查198名开源软件从业者，结合定量和定性分析，捕捉贡献者对团队动态的感知。

Result: 结果表明，沟通相关的团队动态（如响应速度、语气和回复清晰度）被从业者普遍重视，但其重要性因贡献者动机而异。

Conclusion: 研究发现，团队动态与贡献者动机的匹配为理解项目选择行为提供了重要见解，这有助于设计更注重社交协作质量和动机匹配的推荐系统。

Abstract: Open-source software (OSS) development relies on effective collaboration among distributed contributors. Yet, current OSS project recommendation systems primarily emphasize technical attributes, overlooking the collaboration and community aspects that influence contributors' decisions to join and remain in projects. This study investigates how team dynamics within OSS communities influence project selection and how these preferences vary across contributors' motivations. We conducted an online survey with 198 OSS practitioners, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to capture contributors' perceptions of team dynamics. The results reveal that communication-related team dynamics such as responsiveness, tone, and clarity of replies are consistently prioritized across practitioners. However, the relative importance of these team dynamics differs according to contributors' motivations. For instance, practitioners motivated by gaining reputation or networking preferred inclusive project communities that encouraged diverse participation. These findings highlight that understanding how team dynamics align with contributors' motivations provides valuable insights into practitioners' project selection behaviour. Those insights can inform the design of future human-aware project recommendation systems that better account for social collaboration quality and motivational fit.

Conclusion: WebTestPilot通过符号化层和条件推断有效解决了VLM代理在网页测试中的幻觉问题，显著提升了任务完成率和缺陷检测精度。

Abstract: Visual language model (VLM) agents show great promise in automating end-to-end (E2E) web testing against requirements in natural language. However, the probabilistic nature of language models can have inherent hallucinations. Therefore, given a detected inconsistency between the requirement and the web application, it is hard to distinguish whether it stems from the hallucination or a real application bug. Addressing this issue presents two core technical challenges: the implicit oracle inference challenge, where the agent must act as its own oracle to implicitly decide if the application's behavior is correct without guidance, and the probabilistic inference challenge, where an LLM's inconsistent reasoning undermines its trustworthiness as an oracle. Existing LLM-based approaches fail to capture such implicit oracles, either by treating any page navigation that doesn't crash as a success, or by checking each state in isolation, thus missing bugs dependent on context from prior steps.
  We introduce WebTestPilot, an LLM-based agent designed to address these challenges. WebTestPilot uses (1) a symbolization layer which detects and symbolizes critical GUI elements on the web application into symbols (i.e., variables) and (2) translates natural language specification into a sequence of steps, each of which is equipped with inferred pre- and post-conditions over the symbols as an oracle. This oracle captures data, temporal, and causal dependencies, enabling the validation of implicit requirements. To advance research in this area, we build a benchmark of bug-injected web apps for evaluating NL-to-E2E testing. The results show that WebTestPilot achieves a task completion rate of 99%, with 96% precision and 96% recall in bug detection, outperforming the best baseline (+70 precision, +27 recall). The agent generalizes across diverse natural language inputs and model scales.

TL;DR: 论文利用LLMs从软件工程文献中提取证据支持的可操作建议（ReACTs），帮助开源项目实现可持续发展，生成了1,312个高质量建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有模型能预测开源软件的可持续性，但这些模型通常无法提供具体可操作的建议。论文旨在利用LLMs挖掘软件工程文献中的证据，填补这一空白。

Method: 论文设计了一个RAG-pipeline和双层提示策略，用于从829篇ICSE和FSE论文中提取ReACTs。第一层探索不同的开源LLMs和提示技术，选择最佳组合生成候选ReACTs；第二层通过后续提示过滤幻觉、提取影响和证据，并评估准确性和精确性。

Result: 管道生成了1,922个ReACTs，其中1,312个通过严格的质量标准，并被组织成面向实践的类别，可与APEX等工具的项目信号连接。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种可扩展且可重复的方法，利用LLMs从软件工程文献中提取研究支持的可操作建议（ReACTs），帮助开源项目实现可持续发展。

Abstract: When successful, Open Source Software (OSS) projects create enormous value, but most never reach a sustainable state. Recent work has produced accurate models that forecast OSS sustainability, yet these models rarely tell maintainers what to do: their features are often high-level socio-technical signals that are not directly actionable. Decades of empirical software engineering research have accumulated a large but underused body of evidence on concrete practices that improve project health.
  We close this gap by using LLMs as evidence miners over the SE literature. We design a RAG-pipeline and a two-layer prompting strategy that extract researched actionables (ReACTs): concise, evidence-linked recommendations mapping to specific OSS practices. In the first layer, we systematically explore open LLMs and prompting techniques, selecting the best-performing combination to derive candidate ReACTs from 829 ICSE and FSE papers. In the second layer, we apply follow-up prompting to filter hallucinations, extract impact and evidence, and assess soundness and precision.
  Our pipeline yields 1,922 ReACTs, of which 1,312 pass strict quality criteria and are organized into practice-oriented categories connectable to project signals from tools like APEX. The result is a reproducible, scalable approach turning scattered research findings into structured, evidence-based actions guiding OSS projects toward sustainability.

TL;DR: AmbiBench是首个引入指令清晰度分类的基准测试，结合MUSE框架，重新定义了移动GUI代理的评估标准，强调双向意图对齐而非单向指令执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试假设用户指令完整且明确，忽视了代理的对齐能力。为评估代理在动态环境中的双向意图对齐能力，提出了AmbiBench。

Method: 基于认知差距理论，提出了四种清晰度分类（详细、标准、不完整、模糊），并构建了一个包含240个生态有效任务的数据集。开发了MUSE自动化框架，采用MLLM-as-a-judge多代理架构进行细粒度评估。

Result: 实证结果显示，SoTA代理在不同清晰度下的性能边界，量化了主动交互带来的增益，并验证了MUSE与人类判断的强相关性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入AmbiBench和MUSE，重新定义了移动GUI代理的评估标准，为真正理解用户意图的下一代代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Benchmarks are paramount for gauging progress in the domain of Mobile GUI Agents. In practical scenarios, users frequently fail to articulate precise directives containing full task details at the onset, and their expressions are typically ambiguous. Consequently, agents are required to converge on the user's true intent via active clarification and interaction during execution. However, existing benchmarks predominantly operate under the idealized assumption that user-issued instructions are complete and unequivocal. This paradigm focuses exclusively on assessing single-turn execution while overlooking the alignment capability of the agent. To address this limitation, we introduce AmbiBench, the first benchmark incorporating a taxonomy of instruction clarity to shift evaluation from unidirectional instruction following to bidirectional intent alignment. Grounded in Cognitive Gap theory, we propose a taxonomy of four clarity levels: Detailed, Standard, Incomplete, and Ambiguous. We construct a rigorous dataset of 240 ecologically valid tasks across 25 applications, subject to strict review protocols. Furthermore, targeting evaluation in dynamic environments, we develop MUSE (Mobile User Satisfaction Evaluator), an automated framework utilizing an MLLM-as-a-judge multi-agent architecture. MUSE performs fine-grained auditing across three dimensions: Outcome Effectiveness, Execution Quality, and Interaction Quality. Empirical results on AmbiBench reveal the performance boundaries of SoTA agents across different clarity levels, quantify the gains derived from active interaction, and validate the strong correlation between MUSE and human judgment. This work redefines evaluation standards, laying the foundation for next-generation agents capable of truly understanding user intent.

TL;DR: 提出基于zkVM的编译方法，生成编译输出及密码学证明，验证源代码和编译器的真实性，成功应用于实际软件并抵御多种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证二进制文件是否源自其声明的源代码是基础安全需求，但现有技术（如可重现构建）需匹配和重新执行构建工具链和环境，操作复杂。

Method: 在RISC Zero zkVM中执行编译器，结合ChibiCC C编译器，生成编译输出及密码学证明。评估了200个合成程序及52个真实开源项目文件。

Result: zk-compilation适用于实际软件，能成功阻止编译器替换、源代码篡改、输出操纵和重放攻击等对抗性测试。

Conclusion: 通过零知识虚拟机（zkVM）编译软件，能够生成编译输出及密码学证明，验证编译过程确实使用了声明的源代码和编译器。该方法在实际软件中应用性强，能有效抵御多种安全攻击。

Abstract: Verifying that a compiled binary originates from its claimed source code is a fundamental security requirement, called source code provenance. Achieving verifiable source code provenance in practice remains challenging. The most popular technique, called reproducible builds, requires difficult matching and reexecution of build toolchains and environments. We propose a novel approach to verifiable provenance based on compiling software with zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). By executing a compiler within a zkVM, our system produces both the compiled output and a cryptographic proof attesting that the compilation was performed on the claimed source code with the claimed compiler. We implement a proof-of-concept implementation using the RISC Zero zkVM and the ChibiCC C compiler, and evaluate it on 200 synthetic programs as well as 31 OpenSSL and 21 libsodium source files. Our results show that zk-compilation is applicable to real-world software and provides strong security guarantees: all adversarial tests targeting compiler substitution, source tampering, output manipulation, and replay attacks are successfully blocked.

TL;DR: LLM在文本DSL共进化中，小规模案例表现优异，但规模扩大时性能下降，响应时间增加，Claude优于GPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语法演进时，文本实例可能过时。传统模型驱动工程方法不适用于文本DSL，且可能丢失布局和注释等人为信息。本研究系统评估LLM在文本DSL语法和实例共进化中的潜力。

Method: 研究使用Claude Sonnet 4.5和GPT-5.2对10种案例语言各进行10次运行，评估正确性和人类导向信息的保留。

Result: 小规模案例表现强劲（修改少于20行的实例精度和召回率≥94%），但规模扩大时性能下降。Claude在40行时召回率85%，GPT在最大实例上失败。响应时间随规模增加，语法复杂性和删除粒度影响更大。

Conclusion: 研究发现，基于大型语言模型（LLM）的共进化方法在小规模案例中表现优异（精度和召回率≥94%），但随着规模扩大性能下降。Claude在40行代码时仍保持85%召回率，而GPT在最大实例上失败。响应时间随实例规模显著增加，语法演变的复杂性和删除粒度对性能影响大于变更类型。

Abstract: Software languages evolve over time for reasons such as feature additions. When grammars evolve, textual instances that originally conformed to them may become outdated. While model-driven engineering provides many techniques for co-evolving models with metamodel changes, these approaches are not designed for textual DSLs and may lose human-relevant information such as layout and comments. This study systematically evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) for co-evolving grammars and instances of textual DSLs. Using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.2 across ten case languages with ten runs each, we assess both correctness and preservation of human-oriented information. Results show strong performance on small-scale cases ($\geq$94% precision and recall for instances requiring fewer than 20 modified lines), but performance degraded with scale: Claude maintains 85% recall at 40 lines, while GPT fails on the largest instances. Response time increases substantially with instance size, and grammar evolution complexity and deletion granularity affect performance more than change type. These findings clarify when LLM-based co-evolution is effective and where current limitations remain.

*Giuseppe Crupi,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 现代小型语言模型（SLMs）在代码正确性判断和排序任务中表现优于RankEF，且成本远低于大型语言模型（LLMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成中表现优异，但在小众或领域特定语言中表现不佳，且训练和部署成本高昂。现有研究如RankEF虽提出使用小型模型（SLMs）辅助代码生成，但其分类准确性未得到充分评估，且实验模型较旧，无法确定其在实际应用中的有效性。

Method: 训练多个最先进的小型语言模型（SLMs）作为代码正确性判断工具，并评估其区分正确与错误实现的能力。

Result: 现代SLMs作为代码排序工具，性能增益高于RankEF，且与规模大5-25倍的LLMs表现相当，成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: 现代小型语言模型（SLMs）作为代码正确性判断工具，其性能超越了RankEF，甚至在未利用执行信息的情况下也能达到与大型语言模型（LLMs）相媲美的效果，且成本显著降低。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in automated code generation. While effective for mainstream languages, they may underperform on less common or domain-specific languages, prompting companies to develop in-house code generators. While open-source models can be trained for this, only LLMs with tens of billions of parameters match the performance of commercial tools, demanding costly training and deployment. Recent work proposed supporting code generation with smaller models (SLMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and using another SLM to select the most likely correct one. The most recent work in this area is the one by Sun et al. [29] presenting RankEF, a T5 model trained to rank code solutions using both execution-based and non-execution-based information. However, Sun et al. do not assess the T5 ranker's classification accuracy, that is, how often it misjudges correct implementations as incorrect or vice versa, leaving open questions about the reliability of LMs as code correctness judges for other tasks (e.g., automated code review). Moreover, their experiments involve relatively old models, making it unclear the extent to which such a methodology would still help companies in cheaply training their own code generators with performance comparable to those of massive LLMs. We present a study addressing these limitations. We train several state-of-the-art SLMs as code correctness judges and assess their ability to discriminate between correct and wrong implementations. We show that modern SLMs outperform RankEF, even without exploiting execution-based information. When used as code rankers, they achieve higher performance gains than RankEF and perform competitively with LLMs 5-25x larger, at a fraction of the cost.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现ChatGPT在代码审查中推荐更多更改但覆盖率低，建议作为人工补充而非替代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习模型（如ChatGPT-4）在代码审查中推荐质量改进的能力与人工审查的异同。

Method: 通过挖掘研究，收集并手动检查240个PR中739条人工审查建议的代码更改，然后让ChatGPT对相同PR进行审查，比较两者推荐的改进类型。

Result: ChatGPT平均推荐的代码更改数量是人工的2.4倍，但仅能发现10%的人工报告的质量问题；约40%的额外评论指向有意义的改进。

Conclusion: 当前基于深度学习的代码审查技术（如ChatGPT-4）可以作为人工审查的补充质量检查手段，但不能完全替代人工审查，也无法节省审查时间。

Abstract: Several Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique.

*Thibaud Gloaguen,Niels Mündler,Mark Müller,Veselin Raychev,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现上下文文件降低任务成功率并增加成本，建议仅描述最低要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查上下文文件是否真的对实际任务有效，尽管开发者强烈推荐使用。

Method: 评估编码代理在两种设置下的任务完成性能：使用LLM生成的上下文文件和开发者提交的上下文文件。

Result: 上下文文件倾向于降低任务成功率，同时增加推理成本超过20%。

Conclusion: 不必要的要求使任务变得更难，人工编写的上下文文件应仅描述最低要求。

Abstract: A widespread practice in software development is to tailor coding agents to repositories using context files, such as AGENTS.md, by either manually or automatically generating them. Although this practice is strongly encouraged by agent developers, there is currently no rigorous investigation into whether such context files are actually effective for real-world tasks. In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files.
  Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability in DL-based vulnerability detection performance and validate the conjecture that data imbalance is a core issue.

Method: A comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models was conducted to validate the conjecture about the imbalance issue.

Result: The study confirmed the imbalance issue's impact and revealed that existing imbalance solutions (e.g., Focal loss, mean false error, class-balanced loss, random over-sampling) perform differently across datasets and metrics, with none excelling in all aspects.

Conclusion: DL-based vulnerability detection is still in its early stages, with performance variability across datasets. The imbalance issue is identified as a core problem, and existing solutions perform differently across metrics, with none excelling universally.

Abstract: Vulnerability detection is crucial to protect software security. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is the most promising technique to automate this detection task, leveraging its superior ability to extract patterns and representations within extensive code volumes. Despite its promise, DL-based vulnerability detection remains in its early stages, with model performance exhibiting variability across datasets. Drawing insights from other well-explored application areas like computer vision, we conjecture that the imbalance issue (the number of vulnerable code is extremely small) is at the core of the phenomenon. To validate this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study involving nine open-source datasets and two state-of-the-art DL models. The results confirm our conjecture. We also obtain insightful findings on how existing imbalance solutions perform in vulnerability detection. It turns out that these solutions perform differently as well across datasets and evaluation metrics. Specifically: 1) Focal loss is more suitable to improve the precision, 2) mean false error and class-balanced loss encourages the recall, and 3) random over-sampling facilitates the F1-measure. However, none of them excels across all metrics. To delve deeper, we explore external influences on these solutions and offer insights for developing new solutions.

TL;DR: ModelWisdom是一个结合可视化与LLM的交互工具，旨在提升TLA+模型检查的可解释性和调试效率，提供四大核心功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TLA+模型检查虽提供强正确性保证，但实践中解释反例、理解大型状态转移图和修复模型仍面临挑战，现有工具的可扩展性和可解释性有限。

Method: ModelWisdom提供模型可视化、图优化、模型摘要和模型修复四大功能，结合颜色高亮、代码链接、子图摘要及错误信息提取等技术。

Result: ModelWisdom通过交互式环境和LLM支持，显著提升了TLA+模型检查的可解释性和可操作性，降低了调试难度。

Conclusion: ModelWisdom通过可视化和大语言模型将TLA+模型检查的输出转化为交互式、可解释的工作流程，显著提升了复杂TLA+规范的理解和调试效率。

Abstract: Model checking in TLA+ provides strong correctness guarantees, yet practitioners continue to face significant challenges in interpreting counterexamples, understanding large state-transition graphs, and repairing faulty models. These difficulties stem from the limited explainability of raw model-checker output and the substantial manual effort required to trace violations back to source specifications. Although the TLA+ Toolbox includes a state diagram viewer, it offers only a static, fully expanded graph without folding, color highlighting, or semantic explanations, which limits its scalability and interpretability. We present ModelWisdom, an interactive environment that uses visualization and large language models to make TLA+ model checking more interpretable and actionable. ModelWisdom offers: (i) Model Visualization, with colorized violation highlighting, click-through links from transitions to TLA+ code, and mapping between violating states and broken properties; (ii) Graph Optimization, including tree-based structuring and node/edge folding to manage large models; (iii) Model Digest, which summarizes and explains subgraphs via large language models (LLMs) and performs preprocessing and partial explanations; and (iv) Model Repair, which extracts error information and supports iterative debugging. Together, these capabilities turn raw model-checker output into an interactive, explainable workflow, improving understanding and reducing debugging effort for nontrivial TLA+ specifications.

TL;DR: 研究发现，某些性能反模式不仅影响响应时间，还会显著增加能源消耗，而其他反模式则在CPU饱和时功耗趋于恒定，为节能微服务设计提供了依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性能反模式已知会降低微服务系统的响应性，但它们对能源消耗的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 实现了十种反模式作为独立的微服务，并在受控负载条件下评估它们，收集了性能、CPU和DRAM功耗以及资源利用率的同步测量数据，每种反模式重复运行30次。

Result: 结果表明，虽然所有反模式都如预期那样降低了性能，但只有一部分在响应时间和增加的功耗之间表现出统计学上显著的关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为识别同时表现为能源反模式的性能反模式提供了系统基础，并为设计更节能的微服务架构提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Performance antipatterns are known to degrade the responsiveness of microservice-based systems, but their impact on energy consumption remains largely unexplored. This paper empirically investigates whether widely studied performance antipatterns defined by Smith and Williams also negatively influence power usage. We implement ten antipatterns as isolated microservices and evaluate them under controlled load conditions, collecting synchronized measurements of performance, CPU and DRAM power consumption, and resource utilization across 30 repeated runs per antipattern. The results show that while all antipatterns degrade performance as expected, only a subset exhibit a statistically significant relationship between response time and increased power consumption. Specifically, several antipatterns reach CPU saturation, capping power draw regardless of rising response time, whereas others (\eg Unnecessary Processing, The Ramp) demonstrate energy-performance coupling indicative of inefficiency. Our results show that, while all injected performance antipatterns increase response time as expected, only a subset also behaves as clear energy antipatterns, with several cases reaching a nearly constant CPU power level where additional slowdowns mainly translate into longer execution time rather than higher instantaneous power consumption. The study provides a systematic foundation for identifying performance antipatterns that also behave as energy antipatterns and offers actionable insights for designing more energy-efficient microservices architectures.

Abstract: Modern container-based microservices evolve through rapid deployment cycles, but CI/CD pipelines still rarely measure energy consumption, even though prior work shows that design patterns, code smells and refactorings affect energy efficiency. We present PPTAM$η$, an automated pipeline that integrates power and energy measurement into GitLab CI for containerised API systems, coordinating load generation, container monitoring and hardware power probes to collect comparable metrics at each commit. The pipeline makes energy visible to developers, supports version comparison for test engineers and enables trend analysis for researchers. We evaluate PPTAM$η$ on a JWT-authenticated API across four commits, collecting performance and energy metrics and summarising the architecture, measurement methodology and validation.

Motivation: 探讨AI编码代理在移动开发中的实际影响，填补该领域实证研究的空白。

Method: 分析了AIDev数据集中193个已验证的Android和iOS开源GitHub仓库中的2,901个AI-authored PRs，涵盖移动平台、代理和任务类别。

Result: Android项目接收的AI-authored PRs数量是iOS的2倍，且PR接受率更高（71% vs 63%）。常规任务（如功能、修复、UI）的PR接受率最高，而结构性变更（如重构、构建）成功率较低且耗时更长。Android的PR解决时间在2025年中前有所改善，之后再次下降。

Conclusion: 研究首次基于实证数据揭示了AI代理在开源移动项目中的影响，为设计平台感知的代理系统提供了评估基线。

Abstract: AI coding agents are increasingly contributing to software development, yet their impact on mobile development has received little empirical attention. In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again. Our findings offer the first evidence-based characterization of AI agents effects on OSS mobile projects and establish empirical baselines for evaluating agent-generated contributions to design platform aware agentic systems.

TL;DR: 研究证明LLM通过few-shot prompting生成高质量单元测试，人类示例表现最佳，结合问题描述和代码相似性的检索方法最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单元测试生成工具（如SBST）生成的测试缺乏可读性和实用性，而LLM在零样本能力方面已有广泛研究，但其few-shot学习潜力在单元测试生成中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用GPT-4o在HumanEval和ClassEval数据集上进行实验，评估不同测试工件来源（人类、SBST、LLM）对LLM生成单元测试质量的影响，并测试基于检索的方法选择相关示例的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，few-shot prompting能生成高质量测试，人类示例在覆盖率和正确性上最优，且结合问题描述和代码相似性的检索方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs通过few-shot prompting能够生成高质量单元测试，其中人类编写的示例在覆盖率和正确性上表现最佳。结合问题描述和代码相似性选择示例的方法持续产生最有效的few-shot提示。

Abstract: Unit testing is essential for verifying the functional correctness of code modules (e.g., classes, methods), but manually writing unit tests is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. Unit tests generated by tools that employ traditional approaches, such as search-based software testing (SBST), lack readability, naturalness, and practical usability. LLMs have recently provided promising results and become integral to developers' daily practices. Consequently, software repositories now include a mix of human-written tests, LLM-generated tests, and those from tools employing traditional approaches such as SBST. While LLMs' zero-shot capabilities have been widely studied, their few-shot learning potential for unit test generation remains underexplored. Few-shot prompting enables LLMs to learn from examples in the prompt, and automatically retrieving such examples could enhance test suites. This paper empirically investigates how few-shot prompting with different test artifact sources, comprising human, SBST, or LLM, affects the quality of LLM-generated unit tests as program comprehension artifacts and their contribution to improving existing test suites by evaluating not only correctness and coverage but also readability, cognitive complexity, and maintainability in hybrid human-AI codebases. We conducted experiments on HumanEval and ClassEval datasets using GPT-4o, which is integrated into GitHub Copilot and widely used among developers. We also assessed retrieval-based methods for selecting relevant examples. Our results show that LLMs can generate high-quality tests via few-shot prompting, with human-written examples producing the best coverage and correctness. Additionally, selecting examples based on the combined similarity of problem description and code consistently yields the most effective few-shot prompts.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，自动化决策的透明度问题日益突出。尽管可解释AI（XAI）旨在解决这一问题，但现有方法通常需要技术背景，限制了其对新手的价值。无代码ML平台虽试图普及AI，但很少包含可解释性功能。

Method: 研究在开源无代码ML平台DashAI中集成了三种互补的可解释性技术（PDP、PFI和KernelSHAP），并通过用户研究（N=20，包括ML新手和专家）评估了其可用性和解释效果。

Result: 结果显示：（1）所有解释性任务的成功率≥80%；（2）新手在解释满意度量表（ESS）中认为解释有用、准确且可信，而专家对充分性和完整性更挑剔；（3）解释提高了用户对自动化的信任（TiA量表），且新手比专家更信任系统。

Conclusion: 研究发现，在无代码机器学习平台中集成可解释性模块，既能满足新手的需求，也能为专家提供足够详细的解释，这是可解释AI（XAI）面临的核心挑战。

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGS框架通过潜在生成求解器提高PDE长期预测的稳定性和效率，显著降低计算成本并支持跨系统泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究异构PDE系统中的长时程代理模拟，旨在提高长期预测的可靠性和计算效率。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(i) 使用预训练的VAE将不同PDE状态映射到共享潜在物理空间，(ii) 通过流匹配训练的Transformer学习概率潜在动态。关键机制是训练和推理时扰动潜在输入的“不确定性旋钮”，以纠正偏离流形的滚动漂移并稳定自回归预测。

Result: LGS在短时程上与确定性神经算子基线相当，在长时程上显著减少滚动漂移。潜在空间学习及高效架构选择使FLOPs比非生成基线降低70倍，支持可扩展预训练，并能高效适应分布外的256^2 Kolmogorov流数据集。

Conclusion: LGS框架为通用、不确定性感知的神经PDE求解器提供了实用路径，适用于长期预测和下游科学工作流程。

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

Motivation: 解决同一数据的不同表示在计算引擎中产生不同离散结果的问题，记录哪些表示保留结果，哪些改变结果。

Method: 论文提出了决策值映射的形式化定义，并描述了DecisionDB基础设施，该设施通过内容计算的标识符记录、重放和审计这些关系，并将工件以只写形式存储。

Result: 确定性重放能够从存储的工件中准确恢复每个记录的决策标识符，所有三个标识字段与其持久化值匹配。

Conclusion: 该论文通过形式化决策值映射并开发DecisionDB基础设施，成功将表示空间划分为持久性区域和边界，并将决策重用视为可机械检查的条件。

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

Motivation: 企业正在快速部署大型语言模型、检索增强生成管道和使用工具的代理到生产环境中，这些系统越来越多地作为AI资产运作：跨越模型、代理、数据管道、安全工具、人工工作流和超大规模基础设施的社会技术系统。现有的治理和安全框架未提供可实施的架构来应对多智能体、AI支持的网络防御。

Method: 本文介绍了PBSAI治理生态系统，一个多智能体参考架构，用于保护企业和超大规模AI资产。PBSAI将职责组织成一个十二领域的分类法，并定义了通过共享上下文信封和结构化输出合同在工具和政策之间调解的有界智能体家族。

Result: PBSAI展示了与NIST AI RMF功能的对齐，并在企业SOC和超大规模防御环境中进行了应用说明。

Conclusion: PBSAI被提出作为一个结构化、以证据为中心的开放生态系统开发和未来实证验证的基础。

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

Motivation: 尽管LLM作为自动评估工具已被广泛采用，但在多模态环境下（如AI生成图像评估）的提示优化仍存在挑战，尤其是由于上下文窗口限制导致的有效提示优化困难。

Method: 提出BLPO（Bi-Level Prompt Optimization）框架，通过联合优化法官提示和图像到文本（I2T）提示，在有限的上下文预算下保持评估保真度。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个LLM法官上的实验表明，BLPO方法在多模态评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: BLPO框架通过将图像转换为文本表示，有效解决了多模态LLM评估中的上下文窗口限制问题，并在实验中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有训练和评估范式基于理想化假设，忽视了真实世界交互中的随机性和噪声，导致模型在真实部署中表现不佳。

Method: 通过分析真实场景中的偏差和不确定性，将环境噪声分类为用户噪声和工具噪声，并开发自动化管道在现有基准中注入可控噪声。

Result: 在不同噪声条件下，模型性能呈现一致波动，显示出对现实环境扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench框架揭示了当前基于LLM的代理模型在真实噪声环境中的性能波动，强调了其对环境扰动的敏感性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

Result: 在UserRL基准套件的多个任务上评估，BAO显著优于现有主动代理强化学习基线，性能甚至媲美或超越商业LLM代理。

Conclusion: BAO框架通过结合行为增强和行为正则化，有效平衡了任务性能与用户参与度，显著优于现有主动代理强化学习基线，并在复杂多轮场景中展示了训练主动、用户对齐的LLM代理的有效性。

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注计算方面，忽略了数据可用性的不一致性及非可复制研究的评估，且仅评估结果而非复制过程。

Method: 引入ReplicatorBench，一个端到端的基准测试，包含人类验证的可复制与不可复制研究声明，评估AI代理在三个阶段的科研复制能力：数据提取与检索、实验设计与执行、结果解释。开发ReplicatorAgent框架，配备必要工具（如网络搜索、沙盒环境交互）来完成任务。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）代理在设计与执行计算实验方面表现良好，但在检索必要资源（如新数据）以复制研究声明时存在困难。

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

Motivation: 现有对象中心表示不足以捕捉交互依赖的动态，需要更强大的关系理解能力。

Method: 提出了C-JEPA，一种基于对象中心表示的世界模型，通过对象级掩码要求从其他对象推断目标对象状态。

Result: 在视觉问答中，反事实推理性能提升约20%；在代理控制任务中，仅需1%的潜在输入特征即可达到与基于补丁的模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: C-JEPA通过对象级掩码引入了因果归纳偏差，显著提升了视觉问答和代理控制任务的性能。

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2扩展的状态维度虽然增强了时间建模能力，但在自回归生成中带来了显著的推理开销，标准剪枝方法无法有效解决这一瓶颈。

Method: GHOST是一种结构化剪枝框架，利用前向传播统计信息近似控制理论中的平衡截断，联合测量可控性和可观测性。

Result: 在130M至2.7B参数的模型上，GHOST实现了50%的状态维度减少，WikiText-2上的困惑度仅增加约1点。

Conclusion: GHOST框架通过结构化剪枝有效减少了Mamba2模型的状态维度，同时仅带来轻微的性能损失，证明了其在平衡计算开销和模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性代理主要关注单次文本生成，忽略了轨迹级崩溃信号（如循环、不连贯的工具使用或用户-代理不协调），导致在真实世界多轮工具使用交互中难以准确估计AI代理的不确定性。

Method: TRACER结合了内容感知的意外性、情境感知信号、语义和词汇重复以及工具基础的连贯性差距，并通过尾部聚焦的风险函数和MAX复合步骤风险来聚合这些信号。

Result: 在τ²-bench上评估，TRACER在预测任务失败和选择性任务执行方面，AUROC提升了37.1%，AUARC提升了55%。

Conclusion: TRACER显著提升了在复杂对话工具使用场景中不确定性检测的准确性和及时性，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

Conclusion: DrIGM原则通过引入分布鲁棒的IGM，解决了多智能体强化学习在现实世界中的不确定性挑战，提供了可证明的系统鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现仅少量标记（15%）具有强视觉-文本耦合，提出AT-RL框架选择性强化这些标记，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态RLVR中视觉证据如何整合到推理过程中，发现仅少量标记（约15%）表现出强视觉-文本耦合。

Method: 提出了Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL)，一种轻量级框架，通过基于图的注意力拓扑聚类选择性强化高连接性标记。

Result: AT-RL仅引入1.2%的开销，但使32B模型在MathVista（80.2）上超越72B-Instruct基线，并在STEM、视频和通用任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 推理质量不仅取决于标记数量，还取决于跨模态锚定的保真度。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

TL;DR: AgentLeak基准揭示多智能体LLM系统中智能体间通信是主要隐私漏洞，需加强内部通道保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准无法衡量多智能体LLM系统在协调任务时通过内部通道（如智能体间消息、共享内存和工具参数）传递敏感数据的隐私风险。

Method: 引入AgentLeak基准，覆盖1000个跨医疗、金融、法律和企业领域的场景，配备32类攻击分类和三阶段检测流程，测试了五种模型在4979条轨迹上的表现。

Result: 多智能体配置降低了单通道输出泄漏率（C1: 27.2% vs 43.2%），但未监控的内部通道使系统总暴露率升至68.9%。智能体间消息（C2）泄漏率高达68.8%，而输出通道（C1）为27.2%，表明仅审计输出会遗漏41.7%的违规。Claude 3.5 Sonnet因安全对齐设计，在内外通道泄漏率最低（外部3.3%，内部28.1%）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在多智能体LLM系统中整合内部通道隐私保护及对智能体间通信实施隐私控制的必要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Conclusion: 该框架通过将内部推理过程作为主要学习对象，实现了任务级内容和推理活动的组织、调度及演化的优化，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Conclusion: CausalAgent 提出了一种创新的用户中心化人机协作范式，通过自然语言交互显著降低了因果分析的入门门槛，同时保证了过程的严谨性和可解释性。

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

Method: 提出了INTENT，一种基于意图感知的层次世界模型的推理时规划框架，用于预测未来工具使用和风险校准成本，并在线指导决策。

Result: 在成本增强的StableToolBench上，INTENT严格保证预算可行性，同时大幅提升任务成功率。

Conclusion: INTENT框架在严格预算约束下显著提升了任务成功率，并在工具价格和预算变化等动态市场条件下保持稳健性。

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN通过有效的语义-统计信息融合，实现了可控且可解释的人口合成，为开发结合个体行为语义和人口统计约束的生成式人口预测系统提供了模块化基础。

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Motivation: 当前基于固定模板或手动调优的智能体配置方法在处理不同难度查询时表现脆弱且计算效率低下。

Method: 引入ARC（Agentic Resource & Configuration learner），通过强化学习训练轻量级分层策略，动态调整工作流、工具、令牌预算和提示。

Result: ARC在多个基准测试中表现优于手动设计和其他基线方法，任务准确率提升高达25%，同时降低令牌和运行时成本。

Conclusion: 学习基于查询的智能体配置（如ARC）是替代‘一刀切’设计的强大方法，能够显著提升任务准确性并降低计算成本。

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 现有的RL后训练流程将所有输入信号视为同等重要，忽略了不同任务实际需要的模态，导致训练效率低下和鲁棒性不足。

Method: MAPLE包括MAPLE-bench基准、MAPO模态感知策略优化框架、自适应加权和课程调度。

Result: MAPLE将单/多模态准确率差距缩小了30.24%，收敛速度提高了3.18倍，并在信号缺失、增加或重新加权的现实分布变化下保持稳定性。

Conclusion: MAPLE提供了一个完整的模态感知后训练和学习生态系统，显著缩小了单模态与多模态之间的准确率差距，加快了收敛速度，并在现实信号访问受限的情况下保持了稳定性。

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

Motivation: 探究同一LLM代理在相同任务上重复运行时行为是否一致，以及这种不一致性如何影响任务成功率。

Method: 在HotpotQA上对三种模型（Llama 3.1 70B、GPT-4o和Claude Sonnet 4.5）进行了3,000次代理运行研究，观察ReAct风格代理的行为方差。

Result: 行为不一致性显著预测失败：行为一致的任务（≤2条独特路径）准确率为80-92%，而高度不一致的任务（≥6条独特路径）准确率仅为25-60%。69%的分歧发生在第一步搜索查询。

Conclusion: 监控行为一致性可以在执行过程中实现早期错误检测，提高代理的可靠性。

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

Motivation: To extend model diffing beyond base vs finetune comparisons to novel architectures, making it widely applicable for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models.

Method: The paper introduces Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification to better isolate features unique to one model, and applies crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing, enhanced by Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), is an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

Conclusion: NMIPS框架通过神经辅助多任务符号PDE求解器，成功解决了PDE家族求解中的计算效率和可解释性问题，提供了高精度的解析解。

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

Conclusion: MathSpatial 提供了首个大规模资源，将感知与推理分离，使得对 MLLMs 中数学空间推理的精确测量和全面理解成为可能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: The ES framework decouples task execution from workflow construction, enhancing accuracy in structured workflows for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately translating LLM solutions into structured workflows is challenging due to interference between task execution and workflow construction processes.

Method: The Execute-Summarize (ES) framework separates task execution and workflow construction: the model first completes the task using tools, then reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods on FlowBench, demonstrating improved workflow accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The ES framework effectively decouples task execution from workflow construction, improving accuracy and robustness in translating LLM solutions into structured workflows.

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE通过神经符号框架解决了LLM在CFD中的物理约束问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理在CFD部署中因语义-物理脱节而生成物理无效配置，亟需一种能严格保证物理约束的方法。

Method: PhyNiKCE是一个神经符号代理框架，通过符号知识引擎将模拟设置视为约束满足问题，并利用确定性RAG引擎严格强制执行物理约束。

Result: 在OpenFOAM实验中，PhyNiKCE相比基线模型提升了96%的性能，减少了59%的自校正循环，并降低了17%的LLM令牌消耗。

Conclusion: PhyNiKCE通过解耦神经生成与符号约束验证，显著提升了CFD模拟的鲁棒性和效率，为工业自动化中的可信人工智能提供了可扩展、可审计的范式。

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，用于衡量进展的基准测试变得越来越不可靠。分数膨胀和选择性报告削弱了标准基准的权威性，使社区对哪些评估结果仍可信感到不确定。

Method: 通过从2025年91个代表性模型的技术报告中提炼出106个验证基准，系统地描述了评估现状。BHI框架通过三个正交互补的维度（能力区分、抗饱和性和影响力）对评估集进行审计。

Result: BHI是第一个量化基准测试健康状况的框架，为基准选择提供了数据驱动的依据，并支持评估协议的动态管理。

Conclusion: BHI框架首次在宏观层面量化了基准测试的健康状况，为基准选择提供了原则性基础，并支持下一代评估协议的动态生命周期管理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

TL;DR: 论文提出ERM方法解决机器学习因错误因果模型导致的性能问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统因依赖错误的因果关联（P(Y|X)而非干预P(Y|do(X))）而表现优异但鲁棒性差，这种现象称为Rung Collapse。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM)作为因果信念修正算子，结合三层架构（包括Physical Grounding Theorem、ERM算子和失败模式分类法），并通过实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，ERM在1,360个因果陷阱场景中能修复53-59%的顽固错误，而传统反馈方法无效。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种名为Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM)的信念修正目标，通过三层架构解决了机器学习系统中因错误因果模型导致的Rung Collapse问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

Method: 提出Vector-to-Graph（V2G）管道，将CAD图转换为属性图，其中节点表示组件，边编码连接性，使结构依赖关系显式化且可机器审计。

Conclusion: 结构感知表示（如V2G）为多模态AI在工程领域的实际部署提供了可靠路径，凸显了基于像素方法的系统性不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法在不同场景下效果不一，且低置信度推理路径可能引入噪声，导致不可靠的高置信度推理轨迹。

Method: 提出ThinkRouter，一种基于置信度的动态路由机制，根据模型置信度在离散令牌空间和潜在空间之间切换推理路径。

Result: 在STEM推理和编码基准测试中，ThinkRouter在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，平均Pass@1提升19.70分，生成长度减少15.55%。

Conclusion: ThinkRouter通过动态路由机制有效平衡了离散和连续推理空间的优缺点，显著提高了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Result: 在24个基准测试中，SCF-RKL在推理、知识、指令遵循和安全性等方面均优于现有方法，且保持了良好的泛化和生成稳定性。

Conclusion: SCF-RKL作为一种新型模型融合框架，通过稀疏、分布感知的更新有效控制功能干扰，显著提升了模型融合的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

Result: AIR在三种代表性代理类型上的评估显示，其在检测、修复和根除方面的成功率均超过90%。此外，实验还验证了AIR关键设计组件的必要性，展示了其及时性和适度开销，并证明LLM生成的规则在不同领域中接近开发者编写规则的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，AIR框架在检测、修复和根除事故方面的成功率均超过90%，证明了事故响应作为提升LLM代理安全性的首要机制的可行性和必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

Motivation: 多轮强化学习（RL）面临奖励稀疏或延迟、环境随机性等挑战，传统轨迹采样方法可能导致模式崩溃。TSR旨在通过改进rollout生成来应对这些问题。

Method: TSR（Trajectory-Search Rollouts）是一种训练时方法，通过轻量级的树状搜索构建高质量轨迹，选择每个回合的高分动作。该方法与PPO和GRPO等优化器兼容，实现了性能提升和更稳定的学习。

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和WebShop任务中，TSR与PPO和GRPO结合，实现了高达15%的性能提升，并在一次性增加训练计算量的情况下稳定了学习过程。

Conclusion: TSR通过将搜索从推理时间转移到训练阶段的rollout阶段，为多轮代理学习提供了一个简单而通用的机制，与现有框架和拒绝采样式选择方法互补。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

Method: 提出了MaxExp框架，通过直接最大化选定评估指标来选择最可能的物种组合；同时介绍了SSE方法，基于预期物种丰富度预测组合。

Result: 在三个案例研究中，MaxExp一致匹配或超越广泛使用的阈值和校准方法，SSE则提供了一种简单但具有竞争力的选择。

Conclusion: MaxExp和SSE方法为多物种SDM二值化提供了稳健且可重复的工具，MaxExp在性能上优于广泛使用的阈值和校准方法，尤其在类别不平衡和高稀有性情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

Motivation: 现有工业系统采用两阶段范式，导致优化目标不一致和漏斗效率低下，限制了全局最优性。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的端到端框架RELATE，将生成与目标对齐统一在一个模型中，通过策略学习直接整合性能和合规性目标。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集上的实验表明，RELATE始终优于基线方法，线上部署显著提升了点击转化率（CTCVR）。

Conclusion: RELATE框架通过强化学习统一了广告文本生成与目标对齐，显著提升了点击转化率（CTCVR），验证了其在真实广告平台中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: LAVES是一种基于LLM的多代理系统，通过分层协调和专业代理分工，自动化生成高质量教育视频，显著提升效率和降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端视频生成模型在逻辑严谨和知识精确的教育媒体场景中表现不足，需要一种能同时满足多目标要求的高效解决方案。

Method: LAVES将生成流程分解为由中央协调代理监督的多个专业代理（解决方案代理、插图代理和叙述代理），并通过语义批判、规则约束和工具检查确保质量。

Result: LAVES在规模化部署中实现了每日超百万视频的吞吐量，成本降低95%以上，同时保持高接受率。

Conclusion: LAVES通过分层LLM多代理系统成功解决了教育视频生成中的逻辑严谨性和知识精确性问题，实现了高吞吐量、低成本且高质量的自动化生产。

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模无人机群在动态共享空域中的飞行前规划面临重大挑战，如临时禁飞区、异构车辆配置和严格的交付期限，现有方法缺乏可扩展性和灵活性。

Method: DTAPP-IICR 框架首先生成一个基于任务紧急性的初始解决方案，随后使用 SFIPP-ST（一种新型4D单机规划器）计算往返轨迹，并通过迭代大邻域搜索解决剩余冲突。

Result: 在包含临时禁飞区的基准测试中，DTAPP-IICR 实现了近100%的成功率，处理多达1,000架无人机的机群，并通过修剪技术获得了高达50%的运行时间减少。

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR 被定位为在密集、动态的城市空域中进行飞行前规划的实用且可扩展的解决方案，成功处理了大规模无人机群在共享空域中的复杂挑战。

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

Motivation: RLVR训练数据未公开引发基准污染担忧，且传统基于似然的检测方法对RLVR效果不佳，因此需要新的检测方法。

Method: 引入了Min-$k$NN Distance，这是一种简单的黑盒检测器，通过采样多个补全并计算$k$个最小最近邻编辑距离的平均值来量化行为特征。

Result: 实验表明，Min-$k$NN Distance能可靠区分RLVR训练中见过的和未见过的提示，并优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Min-$k$NN Distance是一种有效的黑盒检测方法，能够可靠地区分RLVR训练中见过的和未见过的提示，优于现有的成员推断和RL污染检测基线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在多模态推荐中存在两个主要问题：(1) 跨模态共享语义与模态特定细节的解耦不足，导致冗余或坍缩；(2) 传统Transformer架构忽略了用户交互、物品和令牌的层次结构，导致注意力偏向局部细节而非整体语义。

Method: Hi-SAM包含两个核心设计：(1) 解耦语义标记器(DST)，通过几何感知对齐和粗到细的量化策略统一多模态信息；(2) 分层记忆锚定Transformer(HMAT)，通过分层RoPE和锚定令牌恢复层次结构并压缩历史信息。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验显示，Hi-SAM在冷启动场景中显著优于现有方法，并在大规模社交平台上实现了核心在线指标6.55%的提升。

Conclusion: Hi-SAM框架通过解耦语义标记器和分层记忆锚定Transformer，在多模态推荐系统中显著提升了性能，尤其在冷启动场景下表现优异，并在实际大规模社交平台上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

Method: 提出3D-MAE编码天气状态演化特征作为扩散模型的额外条件，结合VA-MFM策略自适应调整各变量的频谱能量分布阈值。

Result: PuYun-LDM在单GPU上5分钟内生成15天全球预报，短时预报性能优于ENS，长时预报表现相当。

Conclusion: PuYun-LDM通过3D-MAE和VA-MMF策略显著提升了潜在扩散性，在短时预报中优于ENS，长时预报表现相当，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1) 熵引导令牌池化（EGTP），利用实时激活和令牌熵实现高精度静态预测；2) 渐进长度预测（PLP），动态估计剩余长度以处理随机生成。

Result: 在ForeLen基准测试中，EGTP将MAE降低了29.16%，结合长度感知调度器显著提升了端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个轻量级框架，通过重用主模型的内部隐藏状态进行高效长度预测，显著提升了LLM推理的效率。

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中视觉特征与预训练文本表示在深层网络中纠缠导致的物体幻觉问题。

Method: REVIS通过正交投影提取纯视觉信息向量，并在视觉信息被抑制的特定深度进行校准的稀疏干预。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，REVIS将物体幻觉率降低了约19%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: REVIS框架通过正交投影和稀疏干预策略，有效减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

Method: 提出Prototype Transformer（ProtoT）架构，通过输入序列与原型的双向通信，自动捕捉可命名的概念，并提供可解释的推理路径和行为编辑能力。

Result: ProtoT在计算扩展性上优于现有自注意力Transformer（线性vs二次方），在文本生成和下游任务（如GLUE）上表现良好，同时提供可解释的鲁棒性和敏感性分析路径。

Conclusion: ProtoT作为一种新型的自回归语言模型架构，通过原型设计实现了高性能和可解释性的结合，为设计可解释的自回归语言模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Conclusion: Talk2DM模块通过CoP机制成功整合了人类定义的规则与LLMs的常识知识，展示了在VRC-DM系统中实现高精度NLS查询的潜力，同时保持了高效的响应时间。

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

Motivation: 尽管 SAE 在提取 LLM 中的单义特征方面有效，但这些特征通常是孤立识别的，而语言结构是分层的，需要捕捉这种层次关系。

Method: HSAE 通过联合学习一系列 SAE 及其特征之间的父子关系，结合结构约束损失和随机特征扰动机制，增强了父子特征的对齐。

Result: 实验表明，HSAE 能够一致地恢复具有语义意义的层次结构，同时在不同字典大小下保持重建保真度和可解释性。

Conclusion: HSAE 提供了一种强大且可扩展的工具，用于发现和分析嵌入在 LLM 表示中的多尺度概念结构。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

Motivation: 现有的不确定性估计机制在长文本设置中过于限制，常丢弃有价值信息，需要一种更灵活的方法来提升可靠性和信息保留。

Method: 提出了Atom-wise Selective Abstraction方法，将响应分解为原子声明，并用更高置信度但更抽象的表述替换不确定的原子。

Result: 在FactScore和LongFact-Objects基准测试中，atom-wise SA显著优于现有基线，风险-覆盖率曲线下面积（AURC）最高提升27.73%。

Conclusion: Selective Abstraction (SA) 框架通过降低不确定内容的细节来平衡特异性和可靠性，显著提升了LLMs在长文本生成中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

Conclusion: AlphaPROBE框架通过全局进化拓扑结构显著提升了自动化alpha因子发现的效率和鲁棒性，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

Conclusion: MEME模型通过逻辑导向的视角，成功捕捉并适应金融市场中的动态共识，显著优于现有方法，验证了其在投资组合构建中的有效性和稳健性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/gta0804/MEME.

TL;DR: Gaia2 是一个异步环境下的代理评估基准，测试模型在动态、噪声和协作任务中的表现。结果显示不同模型在能力上各有优劣，凸显了现实应用中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多为静态或同步，无法充分测试代理在动态、异步环境中的能力。Gaia2 旨在填补这一空白，推动代理系统在现实场景中的应用。

Method: Gaia2 建立在消费者环境上，使用开源 Agents Research Environments 平台，设计了可扩展的异步评估场景，并配备动作级验证器。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在能力上存在权衡：GPT-5 综合得分最高（42% pass@1），但在时间敏感任务中表现不佳；Claude-4 Sonnet 在成本和性能间平衡；Kimi-K2 是开源模型中的领先者（21% pass@1）。

Conclusion: Gaia2 旨在为社区提供一个灵活的基础设施，用于开发、基准测试和训练下一代实用代理系统。

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成图像的质量和临床可靠性至关重要，但现有方法主要关注图像的真实性或多样性，未能捕捉生成图像是否反映预期的临床语义（如解剖位置和病理）。

Method: 本研究提出了临床语义评估器（CSEval），利用语言模型评估生成图像与其条件提示之间的临床语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CSEval能够识别其他指标忽略的语义不一致性，并与专家判断相关。

Conclusion: CSEval作为一种可扩展且具有临床意义的评估方法，为现有评估方法提供了补充，支持生成模型在医疗保健领域的安全应用。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对推理行为模式的系统性分析不足，导致行为相关提示调整的设计缺乏理论基础。

Method: 提出了两种无需参数更新的优化方法：InjectCorrect（模仿模型自身过去正确答案的行为模式）和InjectRLOpt（通过历史行为模式数据学习价值函数，并利用可靠性感知的Softmax策略生成行为注入剂）。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在多种推理任务中均能提升模型性能，无需修改模型参数。

Conclusion: 通过行为模式注入优化方法（InjectCorrect和InjectRLOpt），无需参数更新即可显著提升大语言模型的推理性能，实验证明性能提升分别达5.34%和8.67%。

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

TL;DR: LawThinker通过三步策略和三维验证机制，显著提升法律推理的准确性和合规性，实验证明其在动态和静态环境中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律推理方法缺乏对中间推理步骤的验证机制，导致错误（如不适用的法规引用）在推理链中未被发现而传播。

Method: 采用Explore-Verify-Memorize策略，结合DeepVerifier模块对每一步知识探索结果进行三维验证（知识准确性、事实-法律相关性、程序合规性），并利用记忆模块实现跨轮知识复用。

Result: 在动态基准J1-EVAL上，LawThinker比直接推理方法提升24%，比基于工作流的方法提升11%，且在过程导向指标上表现尤为突出。静态基准测试也验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: LawThinker通过Explore-Verify-Memorize策略显著提升了法律推理的准确性和过程合规性，尤其在动态司法环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

TL;DR: Mamba-2混合操作符在递归推理框架中表现优于Transformer，提升了候选覆盖率和可靠性，验证了SSM操作符的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在递归推理框架中引入Mamba-2的状态空间递归（一种迭代细化形式）是否能保留推理能力。

Method: 将TRM中的Transformer块替换为Mamba-2混合操作符，同时保持参数数量相近（6.83M vs 6.86M）。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1上，混合操作符在pass@2（官方指标）上提升了+2.0%（45.88% vs 43.88%），并在更高K值下表现更优（pass@100提升+4.75%），同时保持pass@1的持平。这表明模型生成正确解的可靠性提高，且保持了相似的top-1选择。

Conclusion: Mamba-2混合操作符在递归框架中保留了推理能力，验证了基于SSM的操作符在递归操作符设计空间中的可行性，并为理解递归推理的最佳混合策略迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型缺乏主动管理记忆的能力，只能被动接受手动设计的上下文作为全部记忆。StateLM旨在赋予模型主动管理自身状态的能力。

Method: 引入StateLM，一种新型基础模型，配备内部推理循环以管理自身状态，并提供记忆工具（如上下文修剪、文档索引和笔记功能），训练模型主动管理这些工具。

Result: 在不同模型规模下，StateLM在长文档QA任务中始终优于标准LLM；在聊天记忆任务中，绝对准确率提升10%至20%；在深度研究任务BrowseComp-Plus中，StateLM准确率达52%，而标准LLM仅约5%。

Conclusion: StateLM将LLMs从被动预测器转变为状态感知代理，使推理成为一个有状态且可管理的过程。

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中常因过度反思导致高令牌消耗和计算开销，但未提升准确性。

Method: 提出了一种名为ARLCP的强化学习框架，包含自适应反思惩罚和长度协调惩罚两项创新。

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上，ARLCP分别减少了53.1%和35.0%的平均响应长度，同时提升了5.8%和2.7%的准确性。

Conclusion: ARLCP框架通过动态平衡推理效率和解决方案准确性，显著减少了不必要的反思步骤，同时提升了模型在数学推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

Result: 协变量调节的TSFM在无需机构特定训练的情况下，表现与经典基准相当。

Conclusion: TSFMs在零样本设置下表现与经典基准相当，性能差异因模型和队列而异，证明了其在高等教育入学预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

Motivation: 标准二次注意力计算成本高，现有线性注意力方法近似 softmax 的效果有限，需要更高效的近似方法。

Method: 提出 HLA 方法，在计算 token 间相似度后应用非线性，避免了耗时的张量重塑操作，并设计了高效的计算方案。

Result: HLA 在视频生成的大规模扩散 transformer 模型中表现出色，处理大量 token 时效率高。

Conclusion: Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA) 通过引入更高阶的有理函数近似 softmax，并在计算相似度后应用非线性，显著提升了线性注意力的性能，适用于大规模 token 处理任务，如视频生成。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Motivation: 测试中性提示是否能产生人口统计学中性输出的假设，并量化商业图像生成器中的性别和肤色偏见。

Method: 研究采用了混合色彩归一化、面部地标掩蔽和感知统一的肤色量化（使用Monk、PERLA和Fitzpatrick量表）的严格流程。

Result: 中性提示产生了高度极化的默认输出，两种模型均表现出强烈的‘默认白人’偏见（>96%输出），但在性别偏好上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该研究挑战了中性提示能产生包容性表征的假设，并提供了一个强大的框架来审计算法视觉文化。

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

Motivation: 现有研究通常静态描述价值关系，忽视了干预措施（如提示、微调或偏好优化）如何重塑整体价值系统。

Method: 使用基于Schwartz价值理论的受控情境-行动数据集，收集对齐前后的规范性判断，分析不同模型、价值和策略下的对齐效果。

Result: 研究发现对齐往往导致价值间不均衡、结构化的共同变动，这些效应在传统目标导向评估中不可见。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为价值对齐税（VAT）的框架，用于衡量对齐干预如何影响互联价值系统，揭示了传统目标导向评估中不可见的系统性风险。

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

Motivation: 由于全面的大模型评估成本过高，从有限观察中预测模型性能变得至关重要，但现有统计方法难以应对模式偏移、数据稀疏和缺乏解释性的问题，而纯LLM方法仍不可靠。

Method: STAR框架结合了专用检索器收集外部知识，并将语义特征嵌入到约束概率矩阵分解（CPMF）中生成带有不确定性的统计预期，再通过期望违背理论（EVT）指导的推理模块进行预测优化。

Result: 实验表明，STAR在基于分数和排名的指标上均优于所有基线方法，在极端稀疏条件下（每个测试模型仅1-2个观察分数）总分数比最强统计方法提升14.46%。

Conclusion: STAR框架通过结合数据驱动的统计预期和知识驱动的代理推理，显著提升了在极端稀疏数据条件下模型性能预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否真正具备心理理论（ToM），即是否拥有关于心理状态和行为之间因果关系的实际表征，而非仅仅在社交任务中表现良好。

Method: 研究采用了一个基于认知科学的心理理论定义，开发并测试了一个新的评估框架，专门探究LLMs是否拥有一个连贯、领域通用且一致的关于心理状态如何导致行为的模型。

Result: LLMs在简单ToM任务中能近似人类判断，但在逻辑等效任务中失败，且行为预测与心理状态推断之间的一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在简单的心理理论（ToM）任务中能近似人类判断，但在逻辑等效任务中表现不佳，且其行为预测与心理状态推断之间的一致性较低。这表明LLMs展现的社会能力并非源于一个领域通用或一致的心理理论。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决先前QBBN模型缺乏否定/反向推理和自然语言解析器的局限性，提升逻辑推理和自然语言处理的表达能力与准确性。

Method: 扩展QBBN模型，引入NEG因子以实现反向推理，设计类型逻辑语言和类型槽语法，结合LLMs进行预处理和重排序。

Result: 推理引擎处理了44/44测试案例，语法解析准确率为33/33，LLMs在歧义消除中达到95%的PP附件准确率。

Conclusion: 该论文通过扩展QBBN模型，填补了先前工作中的两个空白（否定/反向推理和自然语言解析器），并在推理、语义和句法三个方面取得了进展，同时结合了LLMs的优势，实现了形式语义学与Sutton的'bitter lesson'的调和。

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

Conclusion: 提出的IOA框架在知识蒸馏中显著提升了学生模型的性能，特别是在复杂推理任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出SAM3-LiteText，用轻量级MobileCLIP学生模型替代原始SAM3文本编码器，并通过知识蒸馏优化。

Result: SAM3-LiteText将文本编码器参数减少高达88%，显著降低静态内存占用，同时保持分割性能。

Conclusion: SAM3-LiteText通过轻量级文本编码框架显著减少了参数和内存占用，同时保持了与原始模型相当的分割性能。

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Motivation: 尽管语音识别系统在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在实际高风险短句转录（如美国街道名称）中失败率高，尤其是对非英语母语者影响更大。

Method: 评估了15个来自OpenAI、Deepgram、Google和Microsoft的语音识别模型在多样化美国发音者录音上的表现，并采用开源文本转语音模型生成合成数据以微调模型。

Result: 平均转录错误率为44%，非英语母语者的路由距离错误是英语母语者的两倍；通过少于1000个合成样本微调，非英语母语者的街道名称转录准确率相对提升近60%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语音识别系统在高风险短句转录中的性能差距，并提出了一种通过合成数据微调模型的有效方法，显著提升了非英语母语者的街道名称转录准确率。

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

Method: KeplerAgent通过协调基于物理的工具提取中间结构，并利用这些结果配置符号回归引擎（如PySINDy和PySR），包括其函数库和结构约束。

Result: 在多个物理方程基准测试中，KeplerAgent的符号准确性和对噪声数据的鲁棒性显著高于LLM和传统基线方法。

Conclusion: KeplerAgent框架通过模拟科学推理过程，显著提高了符号方程的发现准确性和对噪声数据的鲁棒性，优于现有的LLM和传统基线方法。

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实目标往往缺乏可验证的奖励，且多轮、多步骤的工具使用RL仍未被充分探索，构建和维护可执行工具环境成本高昂。

Method: CM2采用了一种稀疏奖励分配但密集评估标准的策略，并在可扩展的LLM模拟工具环境中进行训练。

Result: CM2在多个基准测试中表现优于监督微调，甚至与类似规模的开源基线模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: CM2提供了一种可扩展的方法，用于优化多轮、多步骤的工具使用代理，而不依赖于可验证的奖励。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

Method: 提出了CATTS技术，利用代理自身投票分布的不确定性统计（如熵和top-1/top-2边际）作为动态计算资源分配的信号。

Conclusion: CATTS通过动态分配计算资源，在减少计算开销的同时显著提升了多步任务代理的性能，提供了一种高效且可解释的决策方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的预处理方法，能够在最优时间内构建τ-同步集，并支持快速的rank和select查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有τ-同步集构建方法在预处理时间和查询效率上的不足，提出了一种更高效的预处理和查询方法。

Method: 通过预处理字符串并使用自定义变长编码处理稀疏整数序列，结合van Emde Boas树的优化变体，实现了高效的同步集构建和查询。

Result: 在最优时间内构建τ-同步集，支持O(1)时间的select查询和O(log(logτ/loglog n))时间的rank查询。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的预处理方法，能够在最优时间内构建τ-同步集，并通过自定义变长编码处理稀疏整数序列，实现了高效的rank和select查询。

Abstract: A key principle in string processing is local consistency: using short contexts to handle matching fragments of a string consistently. String synchronizing sets [Kempa, Kociumaka; STOC 2019] are an influential instantiation of this principle. A $τ$-synchronizing set of a length-$n$ string is a set of $O(n/τ)$ positions, chosen via their length-$2τ$ contexts, such that (outside highly periodic regions) at least one position in every length-$τ$ window is selected. Among their applications are faster algorithms for data compression, text indexing, and string similarity in the word RAM model.
  We show how to preprocess any string $T \in [0..σ)^n$ in $O(n\logσ/\log n)$ time so that, for any $τ\in[1..n]$, a $τ$-synchronizing set of $T$ can be constructed in $O((n\logτ)/(τ\log n))$ time. Both bounds are optimal in the word RAM model with word size $w=Θ(\log n)$. Previously, the construction time was $O(n/τ)$, either after an $O(n)$-time preprocessing [Kociumaka, Radoszewski, Rytter, Waleń; SICOMP 2024], or without preprocessing if $τ<0.2\log_σn$ [Kempa, Kociumaka; STOC 2019].
  A simple version of our method outputs the set as a sorted list in $O(n/τ)$ time, or as a bitmask in $O(n/\log n)$ time. Our optimal construction produces a compact fully indexable dictionary, supporting select queries in $O(1)$ time and rank queries in $O(\log(\tfrac{\logτ}{\log\log n}))$ time, matching unconditional cell-probe lower bounds for $τ\le n^{1-Ω(1)}$.
  We achieve this via a new framework for processing sparse integer sequences in a custom variable-length encoding. For rank and select queries, we augment the optimal variant of van Emde Boas trees [Pătraşcu, Thorup; STOC 2006] with a deterministic linear-time construction. The above query-time guarantees hold after preprocessing time proportional to the encoding size (in words).

TL;DR: 本文提出一种随机化算法，解决了3SUM预处理问题中子二次空间和查询时间的开放性问题，实现了查询时间与空间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3SUM问题在精细复杂度理论中占据核心地位，其假设认为不存在真正的子二次时间算法。近年来，研究者从数据结构角度探索3SUM问题，逐步优化查询时间，但空间和查询时间均未实现真正的子二次性能。本文旨在解决这一开放性问题。

Method: 提出了一种简单的随机化算法，实现了查询时间与空间复杂度的权衡曲线，具体为查询时间$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5 + \varepsilon})$和空间复杂度$\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 2\varepsilon/3})$。预处理时间为$\tilde{O}(n^2)$。

Result: 算法实现了$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5 + \varepsilon})$查询时间和$\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 2\varepsilon/3})$空间复杂度，预处理时间为$\tilde{O}(n^2)$，验证了在3SUM假设下二次预处理的必要性。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种简单的随机化算法，成功解决了预处理宇宙中3SUM问题的子二次空间和子二次查询时间的开放性问题，实现了查询时间和空间复杂度之间的权衡。

Abstract: We consider the classic 3SUM problem: given sets of integers $A, B, C $, determine whether there is a tuple $(a, b, c) \in A \times B \times C$ satisfying $a + b + c = 0$. The 3SUM Hypothesis, central in fine-grained complexity, states that there does not exist a truly subquadratic time 3SUM algorithm. Given this long-standing barrier, recent work over the past decade has explored 3SUM from a data structural perspective. Specifically, in the 3SUM in preprocessed universes regime, we are tasked with preprocessing sets $A, B$ of size $n$, to create a space-efficient data structure that can quickly answer queries, each of which is a 3SUM problem of the form $A', B', C'$, where $A' \subseteq A$ and $B' \subseteq B$. A series of results have achieved $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing time, $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ space, and query time improving progressively from $\tilde{O}(n^{1.9})$ [CL15] to $\tilde{O}(n^{11/6})$ [CVX23] to $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ [KPS25]. Given these series of works improving query time, a natural open question has emerged: can one achieve both truly subquadratic space and truly subquadratic query time for 3SUM in preprocessed universes?
  We resolve this question affirmatively, presenting a tradeoff curve between query and space complexity. Specifically, we present a simple randomized algorithm achieving $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5 + \varepsilon})$ query time and $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 2\varepsilon/3})$ space complexity. Furthermore, our algorithm has $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing time, matching past work. Notably, quadratic preprocessing is likely necessary for our tradeoff as either the preprocessing or the query time must be at least $n^{2-o(1)}$ under the 3SUM Hypothesis.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于过滤技术的差分隐私算法，用于计算矩阵的顶部奇异向量，特别适用于低相干参数矩阵，提供了超越最坏情况保证的实用性。

Abstract: We study $(ε,δ)$-differentially private algorithms for the problem of approximately computing the top singular vector of a matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ where each row of $A$ is a datapoint in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. In our privacy model, neighboring inputs differ by one single row/datapoint. We study the private variant of the power iteration method, which is widely adopted in practice. Our algorithm is based on a filtering technique which adapts to the coherence parameter of the input matrix. This technique provides a utility that goes beyond the worst-case guarantees for matrices with low coherence parameter. Our work departs from and complements the work by Hardt-Roth (STOC 2013) which designed a private power iteration method for the privacy model where neighboring inputs differ in one single entry by at most 1.

Abstract: We give the first two algorithms to enumerate all binary words of $\{0,1\}^\ell$ (like Gray codes) while ensuring that the delay and the auxiliary space is independent from $\ell$, i.e., constant time for each word, and constant memory in addition to the $\ell$ bits storing the current word. Our algorithms are given in two new computational models: tape machines and deque machines. We also study more restricted models, queue machines and stack machines, and show that they cannot enumerate all binary words with constant auxiliary space, even with unrestricted delay.
  A tape machine is a Turing machine that stores the current binary word on a single working tape of length $\ell$. The machine has a single head and must edit its tape to reach all possible words of $\{0,1\}^{\ell}$ , and output them (in unit time, by entering special output states), with no duplicates. We construct a tape machine that achieves this task with constant delay between consecutive outputs, which implies that the machine implements a so-called skew-tolerant quasi-Gray code. We then construct a more involved tape machine that implements a Gray code.
  A deque machine stores the current binary word on a double-ended queue of length $\ell$, and stores a constant-size internal state. It works as a tape machine, except that it modifies the content of the deque by performing push and pop operations on the endpoints. We construct deque machines that enumerate all words of $\{0,1\}^\ell$ with constant-delay. The main technical challenge in this model is to correctly detect when enumeration has finished.
  Our work on deque machine is also motivated by other contexts in which endpoint modifications occur naturally. In particular, our result is a first step towards enumerating walks in directed graphs with constant delay and constant auxiliary space, addressing a core task in modern graph database query processing.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for combinatorial variants of perpetual-scheduling problems. Given a set system $(E,\mathcal{I})$, a schedule consists of an independent set $I_t \in \mathcal{I}$ for every time step $t \in \mathbb{N}$, with the objective of fulfilling frequency requirements on the occurrence of elements in $E$. We focus specifically on combinatorial bamboo garden trimming, where elements accumulate height at growth rates $g(e)$ for $e \in E$ given as a convex combination of incidence vectors of $\mathcal{I}$ and are reset to zero when scheduled, with the goal of minimizing the maximum height attained by any element.
  Using the integrality of the matroid-intersection polytope, we prove that, when $(E,\mathcal{I})$ is a matroid, it is possible to guarantee a maximum height of at most 2, which is optimal. We complement this existential result with efficient algorithms for specific matroid classes, achieving a maximum height of 2 for uniform and partition matroids, and 4 for graphic and laminar matroids. In contrast, we show that for general set systems, the optimal guaranteed height is $Θ(\log |E|)$ and can be achieved by an efficient algorithm. For combinatorial pinwheel scheduling, where each element $e\in E$ needs to occur in the schedule at least every $a_e \in \mathbb{N}$ time steps, our results imply bounds on the density sufficient for schedulability.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first history-independent solution to achieve nontrivial guarantees of any sort for $m/n \ge ω(1)$ and is the first fully dynamic solution (history independent or not) to achieve $O(1)$ overload with $o(m/n)$ expected recourse.

Motivation: 应用在物流、多智能体信息传播和无线网络中的动态网络连接优化需求。

Method: 引入D-Temporal Multi-Broadcast (D-TMB)问题，并针对六种时间距离定义（EA、LD、FT、ST、MH、MW）进行复杂性分析和近似算法设计。

Result: 单源情况下，EA和LD可多项式时间解决；其他距离NP难且难以近似。多源情况下问题不可近似，除非满足特定结构条件。

Conclusion: D-TMB问题在单源情况下，对于EA和LD可在多项式时间内解决，而对于其他时间距离则是NP难且难以近似。多源情况下，除非P=NP，否则问题不可近似。

Abstract: Temporal graphs represent networks in which connections change over time, with edges available only at specific moments. Motivated by applications in logistics, multi-agent information spreading, and wireless networks, we introduce the D-Temporal Multi-Broadcast (D-TMB) problem, which asks for scheduling the availability of edges so that a predetermined subset of sources reach all other vertices while optimizing the worst-case temporal distance D from any source. We show that D-TMB generalizes ReachFast (arXiv:2112.08797). We then characterize the computational complexity and approximability of D-TMB under six definitions of temporal distance D, namely Earliest-Arrival (EA), Latest-Departure (LD), Fastest-Time (FT), Shortest-Traveling (ST), Minimum-Hop (MH), and Minimum-Waiting (MW). For a single source, we show that D-TMB can be solved in polynomial time for EA and LD, while for the other temporal distances it is NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor that depends on the adopted distance function. We give approximation algorithms for FT and MW. For multiple sources, if feasibility is not assumed a priori, the problem is inapproximable within any factor unless P = NP, even with just two sources. We complement this negative result by identifying structural conditions that guarantee tractability for EA and LD for any number of sources.

Abstract: The Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP) is a classical inventory management problem, that aims to model the trade-off between coordinating orders for multiple commodities (and their cost) with holding costs incurred by meeting demand in advance. Moseley, Niaparast and Ravi introduced a natural online generalization of the JRP in which inventory corresponding to demands may be replenished late, for a delay cost, or early, for a holding cost. They established that when the holding and delay costs are monotone and uniform across demands, there is a 30-competitive algorithm that employs a greedy strategy and a dual-fitting based analysis.
  We develop a 5-competitive algorithm that handles arbitrary monotone demand-specific holding and delay cost functions, thus simultaneously improving upon the competitive ratio and relaxing the uniformity assumption. Our primal-dual algorithm is in the spirit of the work Buchbinder, Kimbrel, Levi, Makarychev, and Sviridenko, which maintains a wavefront dual solution to decide when to place an order and which items to order. The main twist is in deciding which requests to serve early. In contrast to the work of Moseley et al., which ranks early requests in ascending order of desired service time and serves them until their total holding cost matches the ordering cost incurred for that item, we extend to the non-uniform case by instead ranking in ascending order of when the delay cost of a demand would reach its current holding cost. An important special case of the JRP is the single-item lot-sizing problem. Here, Moseley et al. gave a 3-competitive algorithm when the holding and delay costs are uniform across demands. We provide a new algorithm for which the competitive ratio is $φ+1 \approx 2.681$, where $φ$ is the golden ratio, which again holds for arbitrary monotone holding-delay costs.

Abstract: Distributed computing has enabled cooperation between multiple computing devices for the simultaneous execution of resource-hungry tasks. Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems rely on consensus protocols to build a fault-tolerant-core upon which they can build applications. Consensus protocols are correct under a specific failure model, where up to $f$ machines can fail. We argue that this $f$-threshold failure model oversimplifies the real world and limits potential opportunities to optimize for cost or performance. We argue instead for a probabilistic failure model that captures the complex and nuanced nature of faults observed in practice. Probabilistic consensus protocols can explicitly leverage individual machine \textit{failure curves} and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks such as majority quorum intersection, enabling systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

Conclusion: SparrowRL 通过稀疏增量更新和优化传输策略，显著降低了在普通网络环境下进行 RL 后训练的成本，提高了效率，使得跨地域、跨云的 GPU 资源利用更加经济高效。

Abstract: LLM post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) requires frequent synchronization of large model parameters between the trainer and distributed rollout actors. High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.
  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\%. By leveraging on-demand, cross-cloud GPUs over commodity links, SparrowRL delivers 1.21--1.59$\times$ higher tokens per dollar than reserved RDMA clusters at comparable throughput.

Conclusion: DPPS和PartPSP为去中心化网络提供了高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，通过创新的敏感性估计机制和部分通信策略，在保证隐私的同时优化了性能。

Abstract: In decentralized networks, nodes cannot ensure that their shared information will be securely preserved by their neighbors, making privacy vulnerable to inference by curious nodes. Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms.

Result: 在A100集群上的实验表明，LAER-MoE相比现有最优系统加速达1.69倍。

Conclusion: LAER-MoE通过其核心FSEP并行范式，有效解决了专家并行训练中的负载不平衡问题，实现了高达1.69倍的训练加速。

Abstract: Expert parallelism is vital for effectively training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, enabling different devices to host distinct experts, with each device processing different input data. However, during expert parallel training, dynamic routing results in significant load imbalance among experts: a handful of overloaded experts hinder overall iteration, emerging as a training bottleneck.
  In this paper, we introduce LAER-MoE, an efficient MoE training framework. The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training. We perform experiments on an A100 cluster, and the results indicate that our system achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to the current state-of-the-art training systems.

Abstract: Designing a rate limiter that is simultaneously accurate, available, and scalable presents a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, primarily due to the trade-offs between algorithmic precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance. This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case.

Abstract: In the Contention Resolution problem $n$ parties each wish to have exclusive use of a shared resource for one unit of time. The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\left(\left(n\log\log n\log^{(3)} n\log^{(4)} n\cdots \log^{(\log^* n)} n\right)\cdot 2^{\log^* n}\right) \le n(\log\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \log n/\log\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously.

Method: OServe提出了一种基于实时工作负载特性的调度算法和自适应切换方法，以应对空间和时间上的异构性。

Result: 实验表明，OServe在真实工作负载下性能提升最高达2倍（平均1.5倍）。

Conclusion: OServe通过异构灵活的模型部署和动态调度算法，显著提升了大型语言模型服务的性能，相比现有系统平均提升1.5倍。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit immensely from parallelizing both the model and input requests across multiple devices, but incoming workloads exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\times$ (average: 1.5$\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.

Motivation: 现有多区域负载均衡器忽略了集群网络延迟这一关键因素，影响了Time-to-First-Token (TTFT)的优化。

Method: GORGO通过分析计算资源、网络延迟和前缀缓存，优化总服务成本，并对比了三种基线方法：最小负载路由、前缀相似性路由和集中式HTTP代理。

Result: GORGO在P99 TTFT上表现优异，平均TTFT也有所提升，集中式路由器策略使中位数TTFT提高了2.5倍。

Conclusion: GORGO通过优化网络感知路由和集中式路由器策略，显著降低了P99 TTFT，并在平均TTFT上取得改进，证明了其在分布式LLM推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Distributing LLM inference across geographical regions can improve Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by regionalizing service deployments. While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router.

Abstract: Next-generation communication networks are characterized by integrated ultra-high reliability, ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and ubiquitous coverage. However, this paradigm faces significant structural challenges of liquidity and security. Liquidity issues arise from prohibitive upfront costs of network resources, which strain the limited capital and financial flexibility. This also limits the deployment of the resource- and investment-intensive security solutions, bringing security issues. Security vulnerabilities arise from the decentralized architecture as well, particularly threats posed by Byzantine nodes. To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel framework utilizing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization for tokenizing network resources. RWA tokenization uses blockchain to convert ownership rights of real-world assets into digital tokens that can be programmed, divided, and traded. We then analyze the criteria for identifying suitable assets. Through a case study on dynamic spectrum allocation, we demonstrate the superior performance of this RWA approach. Particularly under conditions of resource scarcity, it can exhibit strong resilience against collusion and default attacks. Finally, we delineate fruitful avenues for future research in this nascent field.

Abstract: The convergence of robotics and next-generation communication is a critical driver of technological advancement. As the world transitions from 5G to 6G, the foundational capabilities of wireless networks are evolving to support increasingly complex and autonomous robotic systems. This paper examines the transformative impact of 6G on enhancing key robotics functionalities. It provides a systematic mapping of IMT-2030 key performance indicators to robotic functional blocks including sensing, perception, cognition, actuation and self-learning. Building upon this mapping, we propose a high-level architectural framework integrating robotic, intelligent, and network service planes, underscoring the need for a holistic approach. As an example use case, we present a real-time, dynamic safety framework enabled by IMT-2030 capabilities for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared spaces.

Motivation: 动机是研究局部保持确定性操作符在图形索引状态系统上的构造性子类，以解决全局状态大小与增量计算努力之间的耦合问题。

Method: 方法包括形式化构造性子类、定义BLGC类（有限范围生成器在有限状态空间下的确定性组合），并证明其增量更新成本与系统总维度无关。

Result: 结果表明，在BLGC假设下，每步操作的工作量W_t = O(1)与节点数量M无关，且框架允许在ℓ^2(V; ℝ^d)中进行希尔伯特空间嵌入。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是，在定义的BLGC子类中，证明了每步操作的工作量W_t = O(1)与节点数量M无关，实现了全局状态大小与增量计算努力的结构性解耦。

Abstract: We formalize a constructive subclass of locality-preserving deterministic operators acting on graph-indexed state systems. We define the class of Bounded Local Generator Classes (BLGC), consisting of finite-range generators operating on bounded state spaces under deterministic composition. Within this class, incremental update cost is independent of total system dimension. We prove that, under the BLGC assumptions, per-step operator work satisfies W_t = O(1) as the number of nodes M \to \infty, establishing a structural decoupling between global state size and incremental computational effort. The framework admits a Hilbert-space embedding in \ell^2(V; \mathbb{R}^d) and yields bounded operator norms on admissible subspaces. The result applies specifically to the defined subclass and does not claim universality beyond the stated locality and boundedness constraints.
