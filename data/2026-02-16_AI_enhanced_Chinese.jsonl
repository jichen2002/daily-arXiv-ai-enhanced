Meshed graphs form a general class of graphs defined by a distance condition. They comprise several important classes of graphs, which have long been the subject of intensive studies in metric graph theory, geometric group theory, and discrete mathematics: median graphs, bridged graphs, chordal graphs, Helly graphs, dual polar graphs, modular, weakly modular graphs, and basis graphs of matroids. We also provide 3-local proof labeling schemes to recognize these subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size $O(\\log D)$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the graph).\n  To establish these results, we show that in meshed graphs, we can verify locally that every vertex $v$ is labeled by its distance $d(s,v)$ to an arbitrary root $s$. To design proof labeling schemes to recognize the subclasses of meshed graphs mentioned above, we use this distance verification to ensure that the triangle-square complex of the graph is simply connected and we then rely on existing local-to-global characterizations for the different classes we consider.\n  To get a proof-labeling scheme for leader election with labels of constant size, we then show that we can check locally if every $v$ is labeled by $d(s,v) \\pmod{3}$ for some root $s$ that we designate as the leader.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u533f\u540d\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u548c\u5b50\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u5e7f\u4e49\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u5982\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u56fe\u3001\u6865\u63a5\u56fe\u3001\u5f26\u56fe\u7b49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u7c7b\u5728\u5ea6\u91cf\u56fe\u8bba\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7fa4\u8bba\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9876\u70b9v\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6839s\u7684\u8ddd\u79bbd(s,v)\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u56fe\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62-\u6b63\u65b9\u5f62\u590d\u5f62\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u8fde\u901a\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u4e3a{0,1,2}\u76842-local\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u7b7e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3aO(log D)\u76843-local\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u7684\u5b50\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u533f\u540d\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u76842-local\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u96c6\u4e3a{0,1,2}\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u5b50\u7c7b\u76843-local\u8bc1\u660e\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3aO(log D)\u3002"}}

These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability.

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \\$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u53cd\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u2018\u9884\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u8bed\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff1a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u3001\u6280\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u53cd\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6e32\u67d3\u52a8\u753b\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u573a\u666f\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u6821\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u7ea60.20\u7f8e\u5143\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u53cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We %develop measurements to gather the first direct, non-inferential, and comprehensive data on the NTP pool, including: longitudinal server and account membership, server configurations, time quality, aliases, and global query traffic load.\n  We gather complete and granular data over a nine month period to discover over 15k servers (both active and inactive) and shed new light into the NTP Pool's use, dynamics, and robustness. By analyzing address aliases, accounts, and network connectivity, we find that only 19.7% of the pool's active servers are fully independent. Finally, we show that an adversary informed with our data can better and more precisely mount \"monopoly attacks\" to capture the preponderance of NTP pool traffic in 90% of all countries with only 10 or fewer malicious NTP servers.

When time is discrete, a temporal graph can be defined as a sequence of static graphs over a discrete time span, called lifetime, or as a single graph where each edge is associated with a specific set of time instants where the edge is alive. For static graphs, Courcelle's Theorem asserts that any graph problem expressible in monadic second-order logic can be solved in linear time on graphs of bounded tree-width. We propose the first adaptation of Courcelle's Theorem for monadic second-order logic on temporal graphs that does not explicitly rely on the lifetime as a parameter. We then introduce the notion of derivative over a sliding time window of a chosen size, and define the tree-width and twin-width of the temporal graph's derivative.

We present Variational Green's Function (VGF), a method that learns a smooth, differentiable representation of the Green's function for linear self-adjoint PDE operators, including the Poisson, the screened Poisson, and the biharmonic equations. To resolve the sharp singularities characteristic of the Green's functions, our method decomposes the Green's function into an analytic free-space component, and a learned corrector component. Our method leverages a variational foundation to impose Neumann boundary conditions naturally, and imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions via a projective layer on the output of the neural field. The resulting Green's functions are fast to evaluate, differentiable with respect to source application, and can be conditioned on other signals parameterizing our geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGF\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u4f34PDE\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u89e3\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u51e0\u4f55\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "VGF\u5c06\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u57fa\u7840\u81ea\u7136\u65bd\u52a0Neumann\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u5c42\u65bd\u52a0Dirichlet\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "VGF\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3001\u5bf9\u6e90\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "VGF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u51e0\u4f55\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce GT-HarmBench, a benchmark of 2,009 high-stakes scenarios spanning game-theoretic structures such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt and Chicken. Scenarios are drawn from realistic AI risk contexts in the MIT AI Risk Repository. Across 15 frontier models, agents choose socially beneficial actions in only 62% of cases, frequently leading to harmful outcomes. We measure sensitivity to game-theoretic prompt framing and ordering, and analyze reasoning patterns driving failures.

This paper characterizes the extraction of these three biosignals from facial thermal video using a signal-processing pipeline that tracks anatomical regions, applies spatial aggregation, and separates slow sudomotor trends from faster cardiorespiratory components. For HR, we apply an orthogonal matrix image transformation (OMIT) decomposition across multiple facial regions of interest (ROIs), and for BR we average nasal and cheek signals before spectral peak detection. We evaluate 288 EDA configurations and the HR/BR pipeline on 31 sessions from the public SIMULATOR STUDY 1 (SIM1) driver monitoring dataset. The best fixed EDA configuration (nose region, exponential moving average) reaches a mean absolute correlation of $0.40 \\pm 0.23$ against palm EDA, with individual sessions reaching 0.89. BR estimation achieves a mean absolute error of $3.1 \\pm 1.1$ bpm, while HR estimation yields $13.8 \\pm 7.5$ bpm MAE, limited by the low camera frame rate (7.5 Hz).

We present Visual Foresight Planning (ForeAct), a general and efficient planner that guides a VLA step-by-step using imagined future observations and subtask descriptions. With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA. Importantly, state-of-the-art VLAs can integrate our planner seamlessly by simply augmenting their visual inputs, without any architectural modification. The foresight generator is pretrained on over 1 million multi-task, cross-embodiment episodes, enabling it to learn robust embodied dynamics. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark that consists of 11 diverse, multi-step real-world tasks.

At the same time, generative artificial intelligence is reshaping development practice, offering powerful forms of assistance while introducing new challenges for accountability, reflection, and methodological rigour. Although Action Design Research (ADR) provides a well-established foundation for studying and constructing socio-technical artefacts, it offers limited guidance on how its principles can be operationalised in the day-to-day practice of solo, AI-assisted research software development. This paper proposes the SHAPR framework (Solo, Human-centred, AI-assisted PRactice) as a practice-level operational framework that complements ADR by translating its high-level principles into actionable guidance for contemporary research contexts. SHAPR supports the enactment of ADR Building-Intervention-Evaluation cycles by making explicit the roles, artefacts, reflective practices, and lightweight governance mechanisms required to sustain human accountability and learning in AI-assisted development. The contribution of the paper is conceptual: SHAPR itself is treated as the primary design artefact and unit of analysis and is evaluated formatively through reflective analysis of its internal coherence, alignment with ADR principles, and applicability to solo research practice. By explicitly linking research software development, Human-AI collaboration, and reflective learning, this study contributes to broader discussions on how SHAPR can support both knowledge production and HDR researcher training.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHAPR\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aAI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8865\u5145ADR\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u9ad8\u7b49\u5b66\u4f4d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46ADR\u5728AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30SHAPR\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0eADR\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "SHAPR\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4ea7\u7269\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301ADR\u7684\u6784\u5efa-\u5e72\u9884-\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SHAPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aADR\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301AI\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers.

A company, who can only hire one candidate and hopes to maximize the expected value of its hire, needs to make irrevocable online decisions about whether to hire the current candidate. The classical framework of evaluating a policy is to compute its worst-case competitive ratio against the optimal solution in hindsight, and there the best policy -- the ``$1/e$ law'' -- has a competitive ratio of $1/e$.\n  We propose an alternative evaluation framework through the lens of regret -- the worst-case additive difference between the optimal hindsight solution and the expected performance of the policy, assuming that each value is normalized between $0$ and $1$. The $1/e$ law for the classical framework has a regret of $1 - 1/e \\approx 0.632$; by contrast, we show that the class of ``pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $1/4 = 0.25$ (which is tight within the class), and the class of ``best-only pricing curves'' algorithms can guarantee a regret of at most $0.190$ (with a lower bound of $0.171$). In addition, we show that in general, no policy can give a regret guarantee better than $0.152$.

As long as most of the scene remains static, probes approximate irradiance for all surfaces immersed in the irradiance volume, including novel dynamic objects. This approach, however, suffers from aliasing artifacts and high memory consumption. We propose Neural Irradiance Volume (NIV), a neural-based technique that allows accurate real-time rendering of diffuse global illumination via a compact pre-computed model, overcoming the limitations of traditional probe-based methods, such as the expensive memory footprint, aliasing artifacts, and scene-specific heuristics. The key insight is that neural compression creates an adaptive and amortized representation of irradiance, circumventing the cubic scaling of grid-based methods. Our superior memory-scaling improves quality by at least 10x at the same memory budget, and enables a straightforward representation of higher-dimensional irradiance fields, allowing rendering of time-varying or dynamic effects without requiring additional computation at runtime. Unlike other neural rendering techniques, our method works within strict real-time constraints, providing fast inference (around 1 ms per frame on consumer GPUs at full HD resolution), reduced memory usage (1-5 MB for medium-sized scenes), and only requires a G-buffer as input, without expensive ray tracing or denoising.", "AI": {"tldr": "NIV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u5168\u5c40\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u7167\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Neural Irradiance Volume\uff08NIV\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "NIV\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1110\u500d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5149\u7167\u573a\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "NIV\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5168\u5c40\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u6743\u8861\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8003\u8651\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u591a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u5408\u884d\u751f\u6548\u7528\u548c\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u6743\u8861\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u51c6\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u6392\u884c\u699c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e3a\u7279\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaMo\u901a\u8fc7MoT\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c-\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c-\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6296\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002LLaMo\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "LLaMo\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684Mixture-of-Transformers\uff08MoT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5934\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "LLaMo\u5728\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c-\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\uff08>30 FPS\uff09\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaMo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7Mixture-of-Transformers\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c-\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u4f5c-\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation. Field trials with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) performing adaptive IPP further validate its practicality.

Existing automated approaches, including traditional machine learning techniques and recent large language model (LLM)-based methods, often suffer from poor precision-recall trade-offs. Frequently evaluated on randomly sampled commits, we uncover that they are substantially underestimating real-world difficulty, where candidate commits are already security-relevant and highly similar. We propose Favia, a forensic, agent-based framework for vulnerability-fix identification that combines scalable candidate ranking with deep and iterative semantic reasoning. Favia first employs an efficient ranking stage to narrow the search space of commits. Each commit is then rigorously evaluated using a ReAct-based LLM agent. By providing the agent with a pre-commit repository as environment, along with specialized tools, the agent tries to localize vulnerable components, navigates the codebase, and establishes causal alignment between code changes and vulnerability root causes.

It is important to develop a network control system (NCS) that can continuously coordinate and optimize the movement of UxVs based on mission objectives. However, prior research on NCS aims to always maintain a connected network topology, which limits the utility of the resulting systems. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically increase the topology flexibility for an NCS by leveraging the well-studied concept of disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). We design a DTN-compatible communication utility model that, while allowing some nodes to temporarily disconnect from others, provides for a fine-grain specification of the minimum communication frequency and the maximum hops permitted for message delivery between each pair of nodes. As such, the model supports what-if analyses before a mission to determine the best communication parameters to use for a given set of UxVs. Furthermore, we incorporate our communication model into an existing NCS and evaluate its performance in a simulated scenario involving the use of five UxVs searching for an enemy ship. The results show that our model not only enables the NCS to find the enemy ship faster but also facilitates new capabilities, such as dividing the UxVs into multiple teams responsible for different search areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDTN\u7684\u7075\u6d3bNCS\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316UxVs\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u65f6\u65ad\u5f00\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NCS\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ef4\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316UxVs\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5bb9\u65ad\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DTN\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aDTN\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8282\u70b9\u4e34\u65f6\u65ad\u5f00\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6307\u5b9a\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u901a\u4fe1\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6700\u5927\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u8df3\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4e94\u67b6UxVs\u641c\u7d22\u654c\u8230\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f7fNCS\u66f4\u5feb\u627e\u5230\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u5c06UxVs\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e0d\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DTN\u517c\u5bb9\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u8f66\u8f86\uff08UxVs\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Constructing flow sparsifiers with good quality and small size ($|V(G')|$) has been a central problem in graph compression. The most common approach of constructing flow sparsifiers is contraction: first compute a partition of the vertices in $V(G)$, and then contract each part into a supernode to obtain $G'$. When $G'$ is only allowed to contain all terminals, the best quality is shown to be $O(\\log k/\\log\\log k)$ and $\u03a9(\\sqrt{\\log k/\\log\\log k})$.

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone.

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts.

Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Although the BMC is widely adopted by both practitioners and scholars, significant challenges remain in formally modelling business models, particularly with regard to explicit specification of inter-component relationships, while preserving the simplicity that characterises the BMC. Addressing this tension between modelling rigour and practical relevance, this research adopts a Design Science Research approach to formally specify relationships among BMC components and to strengthen their theoretical grounding through an adaptation of the V 4 framework. The proposed metamodel consolidates BMC relationships into three core types: supports, determines, and affects, providing explicit semantics while remaining accessible to end users through graphical tooling. The findings highlight that formally specifying relationships significantly improves the interpretability and consistency of BMC representations.

The key challenge is that optical switches support one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We overcome this through \\emph{parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration}, which exploits the non-overlapping communication phases of different parallelism dimensions. This time-multiplexes a single set of physical ports across circuit configurations tailored to each phase within a training iteration. We design and implement Opus, a control plane that orchestrates this in-job reconfiguration of photonic rails at parallelism phase boundaries, and evaluate it on a physical OCS testbed, the Perlmutter supercomputer, and in simulation at up to 2,048 GPUs.

This problem considers the decision task of whether two point sets are congruent under translation and rotation. A related and more general problem, geometric hashing, considers the task of compactly encoding multiple point sets for efficient congruence queries. Despite its wide applications, both problems have received little prior attention in space-aware settings.\n  In this work, we study the two-dimensional congruence testing and geometric hashing problem in the streaming model, where data arrive as a stream and the primary goal is to minimize the space usage. To meaningfully analyze space complexity, we address the underaddressed issue of input precision by working in the finite-precision rational setting: the input point coordinates are rational numbers of the form $p/q$ with $|p|, |q| \\le U$.\n  Our result considers a stronger variant of congruence testing called congruence identification, for which we obtain a 3-pass randomized streaming algorithm using $O(\\log n(\\log U+\\log n))$ space. Using the congruence identification algorithm as a building block, we give a 6-pass $O(m\\log n (\\log n + \\log U + \\log m))$-space randomized streaming algorithm that outputs a hash function of length $O(\\log n+\\log U+\\log m)$.\n  Our key technical tool for achieving space efficiency is the use of complex moments.

However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction.

The method claims that accurate spatial control can be achieved by optimizing a single diffusion latent at an intermediate timestep, together with identity-preserving fine-tuning and spatial regularization. This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost.

While functionality-oriented GUI testing has attracted growing research attention, existing approaches largely overlook interactions across functionalities, making them ineffective at uncovering deep bugs hidden in inter-functional behaviors. To fill this gap, we first design a Functional Flow Graph (FFG), a behavioral model that explicitly captures an app's functional units and their inter-functional interactions. Based on the FFG, we further introduce an inter-functional-flow-oriented GUI testing approach with the dual goals of precise model construction and deep bug detection. This approach is realized through a long-short-term-view-guided testing process. By combining two complementary test-generation views, it can adaptively refine functional boundaries and systematically explore inter-functional flows under diverse triggering conditions. We implement our approach in a tool called FuncDroid, and evaluate it on two benchmarks: (1) a widely-used open-source benchmark with 50 reproducible crash bugs and (2) a diverse set of 52 popular commercial apps. Experimental results demonstrate that FuncDroid significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both coverage (+28%) and bug detection number (+107%). Moreover, FuncDroid successfully uncovers 18 previously unknown non-crash functional bugs in commercial apps, confirming its practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuncDroid\u901a\u8fc7FFG\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u77ed\u89c6\u56fe\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528GUI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GUI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u529f\u80fd\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6d41\u56fe\uff08FFG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u529f\u80fd\u6d41\u7684GUI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "FuncDroid\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08+28%\u548c+107%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8618\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u975e\u5d29\u6e83\u529f\u80fd\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "FuncDroid\u901a\u8fc7FFG\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u77ed\u89c6\u56fe\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528GUI\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this exponential growth has also introduced significant security vulnerabilities, making IoT networks increasingly targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices poses critical challenges for traditional intrusion detection systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method called Adaptive Meta-Aggregation Federated Learning (AMAFed), designed to enhance intrusion detection in heterogeneous IoT networks. By employing a dynamic weighting mechanism using meta-learning, AMAFed assigns adaptive importance to local models based on their data quality and contributions, enabling personalized yet collaborative learning across devices. The proposed method was evaluated on three benchmark IoT datasets: ToN-IoT, N-BaIoT, and BoT-IoT, representing diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that AMAFed achieves detection accuracy up to 99.8% on ToN-IoT, with F1-scores exceeding 98% across all datasets.

Formally, for a directed graph $G=(V,A)$ and $k\\in \\mathbb{N}$, a $k$-node strong connectivity certificate is a subgraph $H=(V,A')\\subseteq G$ such that for every pair of distinct nodes $s,t\\in V$, the number of pairwise internally node-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $H$ is at least $k$ or the corresponding number in $G$. In light of the inherent hardness of directed connectivity problems, several prior work focused on restricted graph classes, showing that several problems that are hard in general become efficiently solvable when the input graph is a tournament (i.e., a directed complete graph) (Chakrabarti et al. [SODA 2020]; Baweja, Jia, and Woddruff [ITCS 2022]), or close to a tournament in edit distance (Ghosh and Kuchlous [ESA 2024]). Extending this line of work, our main result shows, at a qualitative level, that the streaming complexity of strong connectivity certificates and related problems is parameterized by independence number, demonstrating a continuum of hardness for directed graph connectivity problems. Quantitatively, for an $n$-node graph with independence number $\u03b1$, we give $p$-pass randomized algorithms that compute a $k$-node strong connectivity certificate of size $O(\u03b1n)$ using $\\tilde{O}(k^{1-1/p}\u03b1n^{1+1/p})$ space in the insertion-only model. For the lower bound, we show that even when $k=1$, any $p$-pass streaming algorithm for a 1-node strong connectivity certificate in the insertion-only model requires $\u03a9(\u03b1n/p)$ space. To derive these lower bounds, we introduce the gadget-embedding tournament framework to construct direct-sum-type hard instances with a prescribed independence number, which is applicable to lower-bounding a wide range of directed graph problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u5411\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u786c\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2ap-pass\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3aO(\u03b1n)\u7684k\u8282\u70b9\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u63d2\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528O~(k^(1-1/p)\u03b1n^(1+1/p))\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6570\u03b1\u7684n\u8282\u70b9\u56fe\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7fk=1\u65f6\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55p-pass\u6d41\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u63d2\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81f3\u5c11\u9700\u8981\u03a9(\u03b1n/p)\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u5411\u56fe\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e86\u5f3a\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u8bc1\u4e66\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A Frankenstein-Style Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u540e\u671fTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08IN\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f17\u5170\u80af\u65af\u5766\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a2\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b(ii) \u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u8868\u5f81\uff1b(iii) \u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u65e2\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u53c8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5747\u5300\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u540e\u671fTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Using the high-fidelity soft-body physics simulator BeamNG.tech, we collect data from a variety of structurally compromised vehicles.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in addressing these threats. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but IoT heterogeneity and limited computational resources cause increased latency and reduced performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Cluster-based federated intrusion detection with lightweight networks for heterogeneous IoT designed to address these limitations. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical IoT architecture that encompasses edge, fog, and cloud layers. Intrusion detection clients operate at the fog layer, leveraging federated learning to enhance data privacy and distributed processing efficiency. To enhance efficiency, the method employs the lightweight MobileNet model alongside a hybrid loss function that integrates Gumbel-SoftMax and SoftMax, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high detection accuracy. A key feature of this approach is clustering IoT devices based on hardware similarities, enabling more efficient model training and aggregation tailored to each cluster's computational capacity. This strategy not only simplifies the complexity of managing heterogeneous data and devices but also improves scalability and overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces end-to-end training time by 2.47x compared to traditional FL methods, achieves 2.16x lower testing latency, and maintains exceptionally high detection accuracy of 99.22% and 99.02% on the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5907\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u96fe\u3001\u4e91\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u96fe\u5c42\u90e8\u7f72\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MobileNet\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08Gumbel-SoftMax\u4e0eSoftMax\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ToN-IoT\u548cCICDDoS2019\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c112.47\u500d\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e2.16\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523099.22%\u548c99.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8054\u90a6\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

In clairvoyant scheduling, where job processing times are revealed upon arrival, the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is optimal. In practice, however, exact processing times are often unknown. At the opposite extreme, non-clairvoyant scheduling, in which processing times are revealed only upon completion, suffers from strong lower bounds on the competitive ratio. This motivates the study of intermediate information models. We introduce a new model in which processing times are revealed gradually during execution. Each job consists of a sequence of operations, and the processing time of an operation becomes known only after the preceding one completes. This models many scheduling scenarios that arise in computing systems.\n  Our main result is a deterministic $O(m^2)$-competitive algorithm, where $m$ is the maximum number of operations per job. More specifically, we prove a refined competitive ratio in $O(m_1 \\cdot m_2)$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are instance-dependent parameters describing the operation size structure. Our algorithm and analysis build on recent advancements in robust flow time minimization (SODA '26), where jobs arrive with estimated sizes. However, in our setting we have no bounded estimate on a job's processing time. Thus, we design a highly adaptive algorithm that gradually explores a job's operations while working on them, and groups them into virtual chunks whose size can be well-estimated. This is a crucial ingredient of our result and requires a much more careful analysis compared to the robust setting. We also provide lower bounds showing that our bounds are essentially best possible. For the special case of scheduling with uniform obligatory tests, we show that SRPT at the operation level is $2$-competitive, which is best possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aO(m^2)-\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5757\u5206\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SRPT\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ecb\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u9884\u77e5\uff08clairvoyant\uff09\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u975e\u9884\u77e5\uff08non-clairvoyant\uff09\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u64cd\u4f5c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5757\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5927\u5c0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aO(m^2)-\u7ade\u4e89\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53c2\u6570m1\u548cm2\u7ec6\u5316\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SRPT\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u522b\u662f2-\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684O(m^2)-\u7ade\u4e89\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u9010\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u5728O(m1\u00b7m2)\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684SRPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f2-\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002"}}

We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects.

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u5728\u7c7b\u7684\u4f20\u51fa\u90bb\u5c45\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7c7b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8fde\u9501\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398100\u4e2aGitHub\u9876\u7ea7\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u548c\u9759\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7c7b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u5728\u4f20\u51fa\u90bb\u5c45\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u7c7b\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5f02\u5473\u5728\u7c7b\u7684\u4f20\u51fa\u90bb\u5c45\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7c7b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative intrusion detection; however, device and data heterogeneity introduce major challenges, including straggler delays, unstable convergence, and unbalanced error rates. This paper presents a Calibrated Federated Learning method with Hardware-aware Fuzzy Clustering (CF-HFC) to enhance intrusion detection performance in heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed three-tier Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture integrates three complementary components: (1) hardware-aware fuzzy clustering, which organizes clients by computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; (2) Fuzzy-FedProx aggregation, which stabilizes optimization under non-IID data distributions; and (3) Adaptive Conformal Calibration (ACC), which dynamically adjusts decision thresholds to balance false negative and false positive rates. Extensive experiments on ToN-IoT, BoT-IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and CICDDoS2019 datasets demonstrate that CF-HFC outperforms baseline methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, achieving over 99% detection accuracy, faster convergence, and lower communication latency.

Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Slot Filling Ordering in Diffusion Language Models", "comment": "8 pages, preprint", "summary": "While plan-and-infill decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) shows promise for mathematical and code reasoning, performance remains highly sensitive to slot infilling order, often yielding substantial output variance. We introduce McDiffuSE, a framework that formulates slot selection as decision making and optimises infilling orders through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance. We observe that larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings.

Hosseini"], "title": "MonoLoss: A Training Objective for Interpretable Monosemantic Representations", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic neural representations, where neurons respond to multiple unrelated concepts, into monosemantic features that capture single, interpretable concepts. However, standard training objectives only weakly encourage this decomposition, and existing monosemanticity metrics require pairwise comparisons across all dataset samples, making them inefficient during training and evaluation. We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets.

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from \"humans watching video\" to \"AI understanding video.\" Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms.

To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training.

These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u7684CBF\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u692d\u5706\u5f62CBF\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u7edc\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u692d\u5706\u5f62\u7684CBF\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u7387\u4e3a76.5%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5706\u5f62CBF\u768440.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, since QUIC provides end-to-end encryption for both data and packet headers, in-network assistance like Performance-Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is unavailable for QUIC. To achieve the similar optimization as TCP, some works seek to collaborate endpoints and middleboxes to provide in-network assistance for QUIC. But involving both host and in-network devices increases the difficulty of deployment in the Internet.\n  In this paper, by analyzing the QUIC standard, implementations, and the locality of application traffic, we identify opportunities for transparent middleboxes to measure RTT and infer packet loss for QUIC connections, despite the absence of plaintext ACK information. We then propose PEMI as a concrete system that continuously measures RTT and infers lost packets, enabling fast retransmissions for QUIC. PEMI enables performance enhancement for QUIC in a completely transparent manner, without requiring any explicit cooperation from the endpoints. To keep fairness, PEMI employs a delay-based congestion control and utilizes feedback-based methods to enforce CWND. Extensive evaluation results, including Mininet and trace-driven dynamic experiments, show that PEMI can significantly improve the performance of QUIC. For example, in the Mininet experiments, PEMI increases the goodput of file transfers by up to 2.5$\\times$, and reduces the 90th percentile jitter of RTC frames by 20-75%.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEMI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cfRTT\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e22\u5305\u4f18\u5316QUIC\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7aef\u70b9\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "motivation": "QUIC\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6\u7279\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfTCP\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff08\u5982PEP\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u900f\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d2\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790QUIC\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ca\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1PEMI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u62e5\u585e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aPEMI\u5728Mininet\u4e2d\u6587\u4ef6\u4f20\u8f93\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\uff0cRTC\u5e27\u6296\u52a8\u964d\u4f4e20-75%\u3002", "conclusion": "PEMI\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d2\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86QUIC\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7aef\u70b9\u5408\u4f5c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u4f20\u548c\u62e5\u585e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\n  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone.

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs.

This paper presents CORTEX (Convex Optimization for Rendezvous Trajectory Execution), an autonomous, perception-enabled, real-time trajectory design and guidance framework for close-range rendezvous. CORTEX integrates a deep-learning perception pipeline with convex-optimisation-based trajectory design and guidance, including reference regeneration and abort-to-safe-orbit logic to recover from large deviations caused by sensor faults and engine failures.\n  CORTEX is validated in high-fidelity software simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The software pipeline (Basilisk) models high-fidelity relative dynamics, realistic thruster execution, perception, and attitude control. Hardware testing uses (i) an optical navigation testbed to assess perception-to-estimation performance and (ii) a planar air-bearing testbed to evaluate the end-to-end guidance loop under representative actuation and subsystem effects.

The three most prevalent patterns are Pinned Version Bump (26%), revealing brittle release practices; Long Line Change (17%), signalling deficient layout; and Formatting Ping-Pong (9%), indicating missing or inconsistent style automation. Surprisingly, automated accounts generate 74% of all hotspot edits, suggesting that bot activity is a dominant but largely avoidable source of noise in change histories.

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (under review)", "summary": "We present a quadrotor dynamics Gaussian Process (GP) with gradient information that achieves real-time inference via state-space partitioning and approximation, and that includes aerodynamic effects using data from mid-fidelity potential flow simulations. While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time. This framework provides an efficient foundation for real-time aerodynamic prediction and control algorithms in complex and unsteady environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u533a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eGP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u52bf\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd1\u8fdc\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Schur\u8865\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u7ebf\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e26\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5206\u533aGP\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5e26\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u533aGP\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u533a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08GP\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u548c\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability.

Our generators isolate distinct competencies and failure modes: (i) contradiction-cycle UNSAT cores with controllable size and imbalance, (ii) SAT instances with a prescribed fraction of free variables to control solution multiplicity, (iii) planted backbones that modulate propagation, (iv) late bridge clauses that couple otherwise monotone regions to probe sensitivity to ordering and revision, and (v) symmetry/duplication variants that test abstraction under renaming and redundant structure. We evaluate LLM-based reasoners on decision accuracy and assignment validity, and quantify robustness under semantics-preserving perturbations such as clause reordering, filler clauses, and variable renaming.

Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans.

Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness.

One particular application of this technique is slice-level content navigation, where the goal is to localize specific 2D slices within a 3D volume or determine the anatomical coverage of a 3D scan based on its 2D slices. This serves as an important preprocessing step for various diagnostic tasks, as well as for automatic registration and segmentation pipelines. Our approach builds sequence correspondence by training a network to learn how to insert a slice from one sequence into the appropriate position in another. This is achieved by encoding contextual representations of each slice and modeling the insertion process using a slice-to-slice attention mechanism. We apply this method to localize manually labeled key slices in body CT scans and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art alternative known as body part regression, which predicts anatomical position scores for individual slices. Unlike body part regression, which treats each slice independently, our method leverages contextual information from the entire sequence.

Submitted to ICML 2026", "summary": "Negation is a fundamental linguistic operation in clinical reporting, yet vision-language models (VLMs) frequently fail to distinguish affirmative from negated medical statements. To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks.

Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to image matching of optical and SAR images, which is based on transforming the images to a new modality. The new image modality is common to both optical and SAR images and satisfies the following conditions. First, the transformed images must have an equal pre-defined number of channels. Second, the transformed and co-registered images must be as similar as possible. Third, the transformed images must be non-degenerate, meaning they must preserve the significant features of the original images. To further match images transformed to this shared modality, we train the RoMa image matching model, which is one of the leading solutions for matching of regular digital photographs. We evaluated the proposed approach on the publicly available MultiSenGE dataset containing both optical and SAR images. We demonstrated its superiority over alternative approaches based on image translation between original modalities and various feature matching algorithms. The proposed solution not only provides better quality of matching, but is also more versatile.

The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception. Our results highlight a fundamental gap between current model capabilities and robust multimodal deep search in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BrowseComp-$V^3$\u57fa\u51c6\u548cOmniSeeker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4f\u89c8\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7c92\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniSeeker\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "BrowseComp-$V^3$\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523036%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728BrowseComp-$V^3$\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523036%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, once a device is embedded in its host environment, conventional chamber- and turntable-based antenna measurements are often impractical. This paper presents a hemispherical angular received-power mapping methodology for in-situ EM validation of installed mmWave modules under realistic deployment constraints. The approach samples the accessible half-space around a stationary device-under-test by placing a calibrated receiving probe at prescribed (phi, theta, r) locations using geometry-consistent positioning and quasi-static acquisition. Amplitude-only received-power is recorded using standard RF instrumentation to generate hemispherical angular power maps that capture installation-dependent radiation characteristics. Proof-of-concept measurements on a 60-GHz radar module demonstrate repeatable hemi-spherical mapping with angular trends in good agreement with full-wave simulation, supporting practical on-site characterization of embedded mmWave transmitters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u73b0\u573a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b89\u88c5\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\u8f90\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u89d2\u5ea6\u529f\u7387\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5176\u5b89\u88c5\u540e\u7684\u89d2\u8f90\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5305\u88c5\u3001\u5b89\u88c5\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u9644\u8fd1\u7ed3\u6784\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u5c04\u5256\u9762\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u8bbe\u5907\u5d4c\u5165\u5176\u4e3b\u673a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8154\u5ba4\u548c\u8f6c\u53f0\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u6821\u51c6\u63a5\u6536\u63a2\u5934\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\uff08phi, theta, r\uff09\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u9759\u6b62\u88ab\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5c04\u9891\u4eea\u5668\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ec5\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6355\u83b7\u5b89\u88c5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u89d2\u5ea6\u529f\u7387\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u572860 GHz\u96f7\u8fbe\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5176\u89d2\u5ea6\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce2\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u826f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u73b0\u573a\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u7403\u5f62\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u73b0\u573a\u7535\u78c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce2\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u826f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \\log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \\log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization.

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.", "AI": {"tldr": "PISHYAR\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u6756\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bfc\u822a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1PISHYAR\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u548c\u4f4e\u89c6\u529b\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f85\u52a9\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eRaspberry Pi 5\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6RGB-D\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u96c6\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM-VLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea680%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5408\u89c4\u5bfc\u822a\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "conclusion": "PISHYAR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u79fb\u52a8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bfc\u822a\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u8f85\u52a9\u3002"}}

We evaluate nine frontier reasoning models under adversarial attacks. Our findings reveal that reasoning confers meaningful but incomplete robustness: most reasoning models studied significantly outperform instruction-tuned baselines, yet all exhibit distinct vulnerability profiles, with misleading suggestions universally effective and social pressure showing model-specific efficacy. Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures. We further demonstrate that Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), effective for standard LLMs, fails for reasoning models due to overconfidence induced by extended reasoning traces; counterintuitively, random confidence embedding outperforms targeted extraction.

Supplementary material included. Submitted to RSS 2026", "summary": "Simulation offers a scalable and low-cost way to enrich vision-language-action (VLA) training, reducing reliance on expensive real-robot demonstrations. However, most sim-real co-training methods rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which treats simulation as a static source of demonstrations and does not exploit large-scale closed-loop interaction. Consequently, real-world gains and generalization are often limited. In this paper, we propose an \\underline{\\textit{RL}}-based sim-real \\underline{\\textit{Co}}-training \\modify{(RL-Co)} framework that leverages interactive simulation while preserving real-world capabilities. Our method follows a generic two-stage design: we first warm-start the policy with SFT on a mixture of real and simulated demonstrations, then fine-tune it with reinforcement learning in simulation while adding an auxiliary supervised loss on real-world data to anchor the policy and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate our framework on four real-world tabletop manipulation tasks using two representative VLA architectures, OpenVLA and $\u03c0_{0.5}$, and observe consistent improvements over real-only fine-tuning and SFT-based co-training, including +24% real-world success on OpenVLA and +20% on $\u03c0_{0.5}$.

However, in scenarios requiring precise contact reasoning, such as robotic manipulation in highly cluttered environments, geometric fidelity alone is insufficient. Standard perception pipelines often neglect physical constraints, resulting in invalid states, e.g., floating objects or severe inter-penetration, rendering downstream simulation unreliable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data. Central to our approach is a differentiable optimization pipeline that explicitly models spatial dependencies via a contact graph, jointly refining object poses and physical properties through differentiable rigid-body simulation. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our reconstructed scenes achieve high physical fidelity and faithfully replicate real-world contact dynamics, enabling stable and reliable contact-rich manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Real-to-Sim\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u521a\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2RGB-D\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6548\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5982\u6f02\u6d6e\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u4e25\u91cd\u7a7f\u900f\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u521a\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675fReal-to-Sim\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2RGB-D\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u907f\u969c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "The motivation stems from the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision-making in safety-critical aviation systems.", "method": "The method involves a hybrid architecture combining Optimal Control with a Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS), specifically a three-stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer, integrated into an optimal control problem solved using FALCON toolbox and IPOPT.", "result": "The implementation showed feasibility for near real-time applications with computation times of 2.3 seconds per iteration, but revealed a critical software incompatibility in FALCON and IPOPT preventing proper constraint enforcement.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes with a need for future validation by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing fuzzy membership functions, and extending the system to higher fidelity models and stochastic environments."}}

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning.

We introduce Language-Guided Invariance Probing (LGIP), a benchmark that measures (i) invariance to meaning-preserving paraphrases and (ii) sensitivity to meaning-changing semantic flips in image-text matching. Using 40k MS COCO images with five human captions each, we automatically generate paraphrases and rule-based flips that alter object category, color or count, and summarize model behavior with an invariance error, a semantic sensitivity gap and a positive-rate statistic.\n  Across nine VLMs, EVA02-CLIP and large OpenCLIP variants lie on a favorable invariance-sensitivity frontier, combining low paraphrase-induced variance with consistently higher scores for original captions than for their flipped counterparts. In contrast, SigLIP and SigLIP2 show much larger invariance error and often prefer flipped captions to the human descriptions, especially for object and color edits. These failures are largely invisible to standard retrieval metrics, indicating that LGIP provides a model-agnostic diagnostic for the linguistic robustness of VLMs beyond conventional accuracy scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGIP \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 EVA02-CLIP \u548c OpenCLIP \u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c SigLIP \u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 CLIP\u3001OpenCLIP\u3001EVA02-CLIP \u548c SigLIP\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210 40k MS COCO \u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91ca\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u989c\u8272\u6216\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 LGIP \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\uff08i\uff09\u91ca\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\uff08ii\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u7ffb\u8f6c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "EVA02-CLIP \u548c\u5927\u578b OpenCLIP \u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u91ca\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c SigLIP \u548c SigLIP2 \u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u504f\u597d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u540e\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "LGIP \u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cEVA02-CLIP \u548c\u5927\u578b OpenCLIP \u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c SigLIP \u548c SigLIP2 \u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002"}}

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets. Experimentally, our method improves simple optimization-based egomotion estimation with 3.2\\% lower RMS error and 1.57$\\times$ faster convergence. On complex downstream tasks, we achieve 9.4\\% lower EPE in self-supervised optical flow, and 5.1\\% lower RMS error in SLAM, demonstrating broad benefits for event-based visual perception.

Xiaomi-Robotics-0 is first pre-trained on large-scale cross-embodiment robot trajectories and vision-language data, endowing it with broad and generalizable action-generation capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the visual-semantic knowledge of the underlying pre-trained VLM. During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks. Moreover, Xiaomi-Robotics-0 can roll out fast and smoothly on real robots using a consumer-grade GPU, achieving high success rates and throughput on both real-robot tasks.

It can dynamically adapt to various predefined bit-widths by cascading different low-rank adapters, and supports real-time switching between uniform quantization and mixed precision quantization without repeated optimization. To enhance accuracy and robustness, we introduce Multi-Bit Token Merging (MB-ToMe) to dynamically fuse token features across different bit-widths, improving robustness during bit-width switching. Additionally, we propose Multi-Bit Cascaded Low-Rank adapters (MB-CLoRA) to strengthen correlations between bit-width groups, further improve the overall performance of QuEPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuEPT achieves comparable or better performance to existing state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/xuke225/QuEPT", "AI": {"tldr": "QuEPT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5207\u6362\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165MB-ToMe\u548cMB-CLoRA\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f39\u6027\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u9002\u914d\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5f39\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuEPT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u5207\u7247\u4e0a\u91cd\u5efa\u5757\u72b6\u591a\u6bd4\u7279\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u4e0d\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5207\u6362\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u5f15\u5165MB-ToMe\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1bMB-CLoRA\u589e\u5f3a\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7ec4\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQuEPT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "QuEPT\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5207\u6362\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u3002MB-ToMe\u548cMB-CLoRA\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eQuEPT\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement.

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImageRAGTurbo\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faImageRAGTurbo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u8c03\u8282\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728UNet\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08$\\mathcal{H}$-\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cImageRAGTurbo\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "ImageRAGTurbo\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002"}}

Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003.

This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination.

In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings.

(1) TRANS-Loco employs an asymmetric actor-critic (AC) model for quadrupedal locomotion, enabling traversal of uneven terrains without explicit terrain or contact observations. (2) TRANS-Nav applies a symmetric AC framework for social navigation, directly mapping transformed LiDAR data to ego-agent actions under differential-drive kinematics. (3) A unified pipeline, TRANS, integrates TRANS-Loco and TRANS-Nav, supporting terrain-aware quadrupedal navigation in uneven and socially interactive environments. Comprehensive benchmarks against locomotion and social navigation baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of TRANS.

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images. We then adapt these methods to cloudy optical data during training, achieving relative improvement of 17.2-28.7 percentage points on cloudy test cases compared with the original approaches.

Project page: https://vvsjeon.github.io/MPD/", "summary": "Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "MPD\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u540e\u5411\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86I2V\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53cc\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e27\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5e76\u884c\u6216\u987a\u5e8f\u878d\u5408\u524d\u540e\u8def\u5f84\uff09\u5e38\u56e0\u8def\u5f84\u95f4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Motion Prior Distillation (MPD)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6b8b\u5dee\u5230\u540e\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u6291\u5236\u53cc\u5411\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MPD\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u524d\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6b8b\u5dee\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u540e\u5411\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u53cc\u5411\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e27\u3002"}}

Prior work trains MCI encoders but typically evaluates them via full fine-tuning, leaving probing with frozen pre-trained encoders comparatively underexplored. Existing studies that perform probing largely focus on improving representations, rather than how to best leverage fixed representations for downstream tasks. Although the latter problem has been studied in other domains, directly transferring those strategies to MCI yields weak results, even worse than training from scratch. We therefore propose Channel-Aware Probing (CAP), which exploits the intrinsic inter-channel diversity in MCI datasets by controlling feature flow at both the encoder and probe levels. CAP uses Independent Feature Encoding (IFE) to encode each channel separately, and Decoupled Pooling (DCP) to pool within channels before aggregating across channels. Across three MCI benchmarks, CAP consistently improves probing performance over the default probing protocol, matches fine-tuning from scratch, and largely reduces the gap to full fine-tuning from the same MCI pre-trained checkpoints.

When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions. To show that this audio-visual tactile sensing approach generalizes beyond the training data, we learn general representations of fabric stretchiness, thickness, and roughness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u5bbd\u9891\u632f\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b097%\u7684\u7ec7\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7ec7\u7269\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5c16\u76ae\u80a4\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u7a7a\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u632f\u52a8\u6765\u533a\u5206\u7ec7\u7269\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u7ec7\u7269\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90Minsight\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0850Hz\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u578bMinsound\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0850Hz-15kHz\u632f\u52a8\u6355\u6349\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u4e3b\u52a8\u6469\u64e6\u7ec7\u7269\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7ec7\u7269\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523097%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ec7\u7269\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0897%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u5608\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec7\u7269\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u6027\u3001\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment.

Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time.

This problem is often addressed by proposing an ad-hoc feature set for a particular swarm behaviour context, usually without further consideration of the solution's resilience outside of the conceived context. Yet, the development of automatic methods to design swarm behaviours is dependent on the ability to measure quantitatively the similarity of swarm behaviours. Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours.

Our approach couples a classical morphological detector with a learning-based refinement module: a SegFormer backbone adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Uniquely, we employ a detector-guided strategy, injecting the morphological map as an input spatial prior, while a masked hybrid loss and logit adjustment constrain the training to focus specifically on refining candidate crack regions.

The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline.

In this paper, we present an agentic control system in which a reasoning-capable language model plans and executes tasks by selecting and invoking robot skills within an iterative planner and executor loop. We deploy the system on two physical robot platforms in two settings: (i) tabletop grasping, placement, and box insertion in indoor mobile manipulation (Mobipick) and (ii) autonomous agricultural navigation and sensing (Valdemar). Both settings involve uncertainty, partial observability, sensor noise, and ambiguous natural-language commands. The system exposes structured introspection of its planning and decision process, reacts to exogenous events via explicit event checks, and supports operator interventions that modify or redirect ongoing execution. Across both platforms, our proof-of-concept experiments reveal substantial fragility, including non-deterministic suboptimal behavior, instruction-following errors, and high sensitivity to prompt specification. At the same time, the architecture is flexible: transfer to a different robot and task domain largely required updating the system prompt (domain model, affordances, and action catalogue) and re-binding the same tool interface to the platform-specific skill API.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5faa\u73af\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8c03\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

As most studies consider synthetic data, it is not clear whether training data mismatch (``domain shift'') or forward model mismatch complicate their successful application to experimental data. We measured CT data from a physical phantom resembling the synthetic Shepp-Logan phantom and trained diffusion priors on synthetic image data sets with different degrees of domain shift towards it. Then, we employed the priors in a Decomposed Diffusion Sampling scheme on sparse-view CT data sets with increasing difficulty leading to the experimental data. Our results reveal that domain shift plays a nuanced role: while severe mismatch causes model collapse and hallucinations, diverse priors outperform well-matched but narrow priors. Forward model mismatch pulls the image samples away from the prior manifold, which causes artifacts but can be mitigated with annealed likelihood schedules that also increase computational efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that performance gains do not immediately translate from synthetic to experimental data, and future development must validate against real-world benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u9000\u706b\u8c03\u5ea6\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u89e3\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\uff08Decomposed Diffusion Sampling\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1a\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u53d1\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u9000\u706b\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff08domain shift\uff09\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u590d\u6742\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u4f46\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u524d\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u706b\u4f3c\u7136\u8c03\u5ea6\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSEASL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4ef2\u88c1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8d8a\u91ce\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u73af\u5883\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u822a\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u533a\u57df\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f1a\u56e0\u5730\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bfc\u822a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4ef2\u88c1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7248\u672c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728Clearpath Robotics Warthog\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TSEASL\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672a\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u9700\u8981\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e14\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86TSEASL\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u8d8a\u91ce\u81ea\u4e3b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate over-smoothing effects through a noise injection mechanism. PixelRush delivers exceptional efficiency, generating 4K images in approximately 20 seconds representing a 10$\\times$ to 35$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior visual fidelity.

Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning. Across extensive real-world manipulation experiments, these two novel methods outperform prior embodied reasoning VLAs and VLM-based hierarchical baselines, including on challenging generalization and long-horizon tasks.\n  Website: steerable-policies.github.io", "AI": {"tldr": "Steerable Policies\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u62bd\u8c61\u547d\u4ee4\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Steerable Policies\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\uff08\u5982\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u5750\u6807\uff09\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLAs\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSteerable Policies\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Steerable Policies\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities.

Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMRad-IVL-22K\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001CoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66AI\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4ec5\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u540e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u4f2a\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MMRad-IVL-22K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u542b21,994\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8986\u76d635\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001CoT\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672cCoT\uff08\u5982RadGraph\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u53476%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e03\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90LVLMs\u4e2d\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "MMRad-IVL-22K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66AI\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc1\u636e\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u533b\u5b66AI\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u3002"}}

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps.

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer.

To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning.

Intrapartum biometry plays a critical role in monitoring labor progression; however, the routine use of ultrasound in resource-limited settings is hindered by a shortage of trained sonographers. To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing.

While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks.

However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following.

However, recent studies reveal that joint learning often overfits certain modalities while neglecting others, leading to performance inferior to that of unimodal learning. Although previous efforts have sought to balance modal contributions or combine joint and unimodal learning, thereby mitigating the degradation of weaker modalities with promising outcomes, few have examined the relationship between joint and unimodal learning from an information-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels. By maximizing this objective, our approach alleviates modality competition while capturing inter-modal interactions via feature alignment. Building on Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE), we introduce Total Correlation Neural Estimation (TCNE) to derive a lower bound for total correlation. Subsequently, we present TCMax, a hyperparameter-free loss function that maximizes total correlation through variational bound optimization.

It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings.

Most FL approaches rely on expensive, iterative deep network optimization, which still risks privacy via shared gradients. In this work, we propose FedHENet, extending the FedHEONN framework to image classification. By using a fixed, pre-trained feature extractor and learning only a single output layer, we avoid costly local fine-tuning. This layer is learned by analytically aggregating client knowledge in a single round of communication using homomorphic encryption (HE). Experiments show that FedHENet achieves competitive accuracy compared to iterative FL baselines while demonstrating superior stability performance and up to 70\\% better energy efficiency. Crucially, our method is hyperparameter-free, removing the carbon footprint associated with hyperparameter tuning in standard FL.

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMLLM\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a12\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u3001MLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing dietary assessment methods largely rely on single-image analysis or appearance-based inference, including recent vision-language models, which lack explicit geometric reasoning and are sensitive to scale ambiguity. This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions. Experimental results show that while strong vision--language baselines achieve competitive performance, geometry-based reconstruction methods provide both improved accuracy and greater robustness, with the top-performing approach achieving 0.21 MAPE in volume estimation and 5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance in geometric accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u5f0f\u5c3a\u5ea63D\u91cd\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u9910\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u98df\u7269\u5206\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u996e\u98df\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6216\u5916\u89c2\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u654f\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u98df\u7269\u5206\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5c3a\u5ea63D\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u9910\u5177\uff09\u63a8\u65ad\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98df\u7269\u4f53\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.21 MAPE\u548c5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance\u3002"}}

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets.

Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS.

Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u76f8\u673a\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08UERW\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\uff08MMC\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u504f\u79fb\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\u6355\u6349\u4e5d\u540d\u65e0\u635f\u4f24\u6210\u5e74\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6267\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316UERW\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a$0.61 \\pm 0.12$%\u6bcf\u516b\u5206\u4f53\u53ef\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u800c\u504f\u79fb\u89c6\u89d2\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08$-5.66 \\pm 0.45$%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u9762\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08UERW\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u524d\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u76f8\u673a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5355\u76eeMMC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728UERW\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u80a2\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002"}}

Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., \"left-most apple\") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., \"where can I safely store the knife?\"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while ConverSeg-Net trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on ConverSeg and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks.
