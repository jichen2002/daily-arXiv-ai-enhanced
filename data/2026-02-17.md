TL;DR: MAILS是一种新型无人机无地图LiDAR重定位框架，通过创新模块提升特征提取鲁棒性，并在新构建的数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在GNSS信号弱或不可用环境下需要高精度定位，现有LiDAR重定位方法在无人机场景中精度显著下降。

Method: 提出MAILS框架，包括局部保持滑动窗口注意力模块、坐标无关特征初始化模块和局部不变位置编码机制。

Result: 实验表明MAILS实现了满意的定位精度，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MAILS框架在无人机LiDAR重定位中表现出色，显著优于现有技术，代码和数据集即将发布。

Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals. However, existing LiDAR relocalization methods are primarily tailored to autonomous driving, exhibiting significantly degraded accuracy in UAV scenarios. In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

TL;DR: XIL（特别是CAIPI）能有效减少视觉分类器中的偏见，提高公平性，尽管可能轻微影响性能，但CAIPI甚至可能提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索XIL学习范式在视觉分类器中减轻偏见和虚假相关性的能力，特别是在性别分类等易受数据偏见影响的场景中。

Method: 研究比较了两种XIL策略（CAIPI和RRR）以及一种新型混合方法，通过GradCAM和BLA生成的解释与分割掩码进行定量评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些方法能有效引导模型关注相关图像特征（尤其是CAIPI），并减少模型偏见（即平衡男女预测的误分类率）。

Conclusion: XIL方法，特别是CAIPI，在提高透明度和公平性方面表现出色，尽管可能导致轻微的性能下降，但CAIPI甚至可能提升分类准确性。

Abstract: Explanatory interactive learning (XIL) enables users to guide model training in machine learning (ML) by providing feedback on the model's explanations, thereby helping it to focus on features that are relevant to the prediction from the user's perspective. In this study, we explore the capability of this learning paradigm to mitigate bias and spurious correlations in visual classifiers, specifically in scenarios prone to data bias, such as gender classification. We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy.

### [3] [Gaussian Mesh Renderer for Lightweight Differentiable Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14493)
*Xinpeng Liu,Fumio Okura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMR是一种结合3DGS和网格表示的轻量级微分渲染器，优化效率高且梯度平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于网格的微分渲染器存在优化速度慢或计算量大的问题，而3DGS虽然能实现高保真虚拟化和快速渲染，但无法直接用于网格表示。因此，需要一种既能保留网格结构又能高效优化的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR)的轻量级微分网格渲染器，利用3DGS的高效光栅化过程，将高斯和网格表示紧密结合。每个高斯基元从对应的网格三角形中解析导出，保持结构保真度并实现梯度流动。

Result: 与传统网格渲染器相比，GMR实现了更平滑的梯度，尤其在小批量内存受限的情况下优化效果更佳。

Conclusion: Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR) 通过结合高斯和网格表示，提供了一种轻量级且高效的微分网格渲染方法，显著提升了优化效率和梯度平滑度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled high-fidelity virtualization with fast rendering and optimization for novel view synthesis. On the other hand, triangle mesh models still remain a popular choice for surface reconstruction but suffer from slow or heavy optimization in traditional mesh-based differentiable renderers. To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow. Compared to the traditional mesh renderers, our method achieves smoother gradients, which especially contributes to better optimization using smaller batch sizes with limited memory. Our implementation is available in the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/huntorochi/Gaussian-Mesh-Renderer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COOPERTRIM通过动态特征选择和共享机制，显著降低带宽需求并保持感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有限通信带宽与丰富传感器信息之间的冲突，通过时间连续性减少冗余传输。

Method: 提出了一种自适应选择框架COOPERTRIM，结合了时间不确定度度量和数据驱动机制，动态调整共享特征的数量。

Result: 在语义分割和3D检测任务中，COOPERTRIM分别实现了80.28%和72.52%的带宽减少，同时保持准确性，并显著提升了IoU。

Conclusion: COOPERTRIM通过引入时间感知的动态特征选择和共享机制，显著降低了带宽需求，同时保持了感知性能，为实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Cooperative perception enables autonomous agents to share encoded representations over wireless communication to enhance each other's live situational awareness. However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment.

*Paul Jonas Kurz,Tobias Jan Wieczorek,Mohamed A. Abdelsalam,Rahaf Aljundi,Marcus Rohrbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 量化压缩MLLM会降低准确性和可靠性，但数据感知方法和Selector能有效缓解。int4 MBQ+Selector组合在高效性和可靠性间取得最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM在边缘设备部署时面临模型过大和过度自信（高确信但错误答案）的双重挑战，需研究量化压缩如何影响其准确性和可靠性。

Method: 研究了两种MLLM（Qwen2-VL-7B和Idefics3-8B）在不同量化位宽下的表现，比较了数据无关（HQQ）和数据感知（MBQ）量化方法，并测试了Selector置信度估计器在量化后的鲁棒性。

Result: PTQ会降低准确性和可靠性，但数据感知方法效果更优。Selector能显著缓解可靠性下降，int4 MBQ与Selector组合在内存需求减少75%时性能接近未压缩模型。

Conclusion: PTQ压缩会降低多模态大语言模型的准确性和可靠性，但数据感知方法（如MBQ）能缓解这一影响。结合int4 MBQ和Selector置信度估计器，能在减少75%内存需求的同时接近未压缩模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) are increasingly deployed in domains where both reliability and efficiency are critical. However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings.

*Hao Liu,Suhaib A. Fahmy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出协作推理框架，结合边缘和近边缘ViT，动态路由和渐进训练策略，显著提升准确性、降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在边缘设备上部署时的高计算复杂度和云卸载的高延迟问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的协作推理框架，结合边缘设备上的轻量级通用ViT和近边缘加速器上的多个中型专家ViT，并设计了动态路由机制和渐进式专家训练策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，该方法在目标子集上的专家准确性提升了4.12%，整体准确性提升了2.76%，延迟降低45%，能耗减少46%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的协作推理框架显著提升了边缘设备上Vision Transformers的部署效率，通过动态路由和渐进式专家训练策略，在准确性、延迟和能耗方面均取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Deploying Vision Transformers on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity, while full offloading to cloud resources presents significant latency overheads. We propose a novel collaborative inference framework, which orchestrates a lightweight generalist ViT on an edge device and multiple medium-sized expert ViTs on a near-edge accelerator. A novel routing mechanism uses the edge model's Top-$\mathit{k}$ predictions to dynamically select the most relevant expert for samples with low confidence. We further design a progressive specialist training strategy to enhance expert accuracy on dataset subsets. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset using a real-world edge and near-edge testbed demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Specifically, the proposed training strategy improves expert specialization accuracy by 4.12% on target subsets and enhances overall accuracy by 2.76% over static experts. Moreover, our method reduces latency by up to 45% compared to edge execution, and energy consumption by up to 46% compared to just near-edge offload.

*Xiaoxu Peng,Dong Zhou,Jianwen Zhang,Guanghui Sun,Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NutVLM 是一个自适应的防御框架，通过检测-净化机制和提示调优提升自动驾驶中视觉语言模型的安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在自动驾驶中的防御方法有限，难以平衡鲁棒性与干净样本性能。

Method: 提出 NutVLM 框架，结合 NutNet++ 作为哨兵机制进行三分类检测，并通过高效灰度掩码和专家引导的对抗提示调优（EAPT）处理局部和全局威胁。

Result: 在 Dolphins 基准测试中，NutVLM 在准确性、语言评分和 GPT 评分等整体指标上提升了4.89%。

Conclusion: NutVLM 被验证为智能交通的可扩展安全解决方案，整体指标提升了4.89%。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have advanced perception in autonomous driving (AD), but they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats. These risks range from localized physical patches to imperceptible global perturbations. Existing defense methods for VLMs remain limited and often fail to reconcile robustness with clean-sample performance. To bridge these gaps, we propose NutVLM, a comprehensive self-adaptive defense framework designed to secure the entire perception-decision lifecycle. Specifically, we first employ NutNet++ as a sentinel, which is a unified detection-purification mechanism. It identifies benign samples, local patches, and global perturbations through three-way classification. Subsequently, localized threats are purified via efficient grayscale masking, while global perturbations trigger Expert-guided Adversarial Prompt Tuning (EAPT). Instead of the costly parameter updates of full-model fine-tuning, EAPT generates "corrective driving prompts" via gradient-based latent optimization and discrete projection. These prompts refocus the VLM's attention without requiring exhaustive full-model retraining. Evaluated on the Dolphins benchmark, our NutVLM yields a 4.89% improvement in overall metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Language Score, and GPT Score). These results validate NutVLM as a scalable security solution for intelligent transportation. Our code is available at https://github.com/PXX/NutVLM.

*Jiarong Liang,Max Ku,Ka-Hei Hui,Ping Nie,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VisPhyWorld框架评估MLLMs的物理推理能力，发现其在语义理解强但物理参数推断和动态模拟方面不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多模态大语言模型是否真正推理物理动态具有挑战性，现有基准大多依赖识别式协议，难以测试明确的物理假设。

Method: 提出了VisPhyWorld框架，通过要求模型从视觉观察生成可执行的模拟器代码来评估物理推理能力。

Result: VisPhyBench基准包含209个评估场景，实验表明模型在97.7%的情况下能生成有效的重建视频。

Conclusion: 尽管最先进的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在语义场景理解方面表现强劲，但在准确推断物理参数和模拟一致的物理动态方面仍存在困难。

Abstract: Evaluating whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) genuinely reason about physical dynamics remains challenging. Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文通过分解HRRP数据并提出两种物理解释指标，解决了生成数据评估缺乏可解释性的问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HRRP生成领域依赖分类模型评估生成数据，缺乏可解释性和多层次评估能力，因此需要更透明和物理可解释的评估方法。

Method: 将HRRP数据分解为三个组成部分：掩码、特征和噪声，并基于这些数据的物理解释提出了两种评估指标。

Result: 提出的指标在昂贵数据集上验证了其有效性，展示了在挑战性任务中的判别能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于物理解释的HRRP数据分解方法，并设计了两种新指标来评估生成数据的质量，证明了这些指标在具有挑战性任务中的判别能力。

Abstract: High-resolution range profile (HRRP ) data are in vogue in radar automatic target recognition (RATR). With the interest in classifying models using HRRP, filling gaps in datasets using generative models has recently received promising contributions. Evaluating generated data is a challenging topic, even for explicit data like face images. However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究通过条件化生成模型，利用大规模海上数据库，证明了几何条件是生成稳健HRRP的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HRRP在获取条件下敏感性高、跨操作场景鲁棒性不足的问题，以及先前研究受限于小规模、高度特定数据集的局限性。

Method: 通过在大规模海上数据库上训练生成模型，并基于船舶尺寸和期望的方位角进行条件化。

Result: 合成的HRRP签名再现了真实数据中预期的视线几何趋势。

Conclusion: 研究强调了采集几何条件在生成稳健高分辨率距离像（HRRP）中的核心作用。

Abstract: High-resolution range profiles (HRRPs) enable fast onboard processing for radar automatic target recognition, but their strong sensitivity to acquisition conditions limits robustness across operational scenarios. Conditional HRRP generation can mitigate this issue, yet prior studies are constrained by small, highly specific datasets. We study HRRP synthesis on a largescale maritime database representative of coastal surveillance variability. Our analysis indicates that the fundamental scenario drivers are geometric: ship dimensions and the desired aspect angle. Conditioning on these variables, we train generative models and show that the synthesized signatures reproduce the expected line-of-sight geometric trend observed in real data. These results highlight the central role of acquisition geometry for robust HRRP generation.

*Manfred M. Fischer,Joshua Pitts*

TL;DR: 研究发现，卷积网络的有效深度（而非名义深度）是关键，残差和inception架构能更高效地利用深度提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度如何影响分类性能、收敛行为和计算效率，以解决深度增加不一定带来性能提升的问题。

Method: 通过标准化训练协议并明确区分名义深度和有效深度，对VGG、ResNet和GoogLeNet三种经典卷积神经网络架构进行对比研究。

Result: 残差和基于inception的架构能够将额外深度转化为更高的准确性，同时在较低的有效深度下实现更好的准确性与计算效率的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明，卷积网络中的有效深度（而非名义深度）是决定深度作为可扩展维度的关键因素。

Abstract: Increasing convolutional depth has been central to advances in image recognition, yet deeper networks do not uniformly yield higher accuracy, stable optimization, or efficient computation. We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.

TL;DR: KidMesh是一种端到端深度学习方法，可直接从MRU图像重建CH网格，无需后处理，速度快且精度高，适用于尿动力学模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于体素的分割方法主要关注形态特征，无法直接用于功能评估（如尿动力学模拟），需要复杂后处理步骤。KidMesh旨在解决这一限制。

Method: KidMesh是一种基于深度神经网络的端到端方法，通过从MRU图像中提取特征图，并通过网格采样将其转换为特征顶点，然后根据这些特征顶点变形模板网格以生成特定的CH网格。

Result: KidMesh平均0.4秒内重建CH网格，性能与传统方法相当，无需后处理。重建网格无自相交，顶点误差距离超过3.2mm和6.4mm的比例分别为3.7%和0.2%。网格经栅格化后，与手动勾画的CH掩模的Dice分数为0.86。

Conclusion: KidMesh方法能够直接从MRU图像中自动重建CH网格，无需复杂的后处理步骤，且重建的网格质量高，可用于尿液流动模拟，为临床实践提供有价值的尿动力学信息。

Abstract: Pediatric congenital hydronephrosis (CH) is a common urinary tract disorder, primarily caused by obstruction at the renal pelvis-ureter junction. Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice.

TL;DR: DriveMamba是一种高效的单阶段E2E-AD范式，通过动态任务关系建模和线性复杂度操作符解决现有系统的信息丢失和效率问题，实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有E2E-AD系统（如UniAD）采用模块化设计，依赖密集BEV特征和手动排序，导致信息丢失和累积错误，且缺乏灵活多样的模块间关系建模。图像主干训练不足和注意力机制的二次复杂度也限制了系统的可扩展性和效率。

Method: 提出DriveMamba，一种任务中心化的可扩展范式，通过单阶段统一Mamba解码器整合动态任务关系建模、隐式视图对应学习和长期时间融合。图像特征和任务输出被预先转换为令牌级稀疏表示，并按其在3D空间中的实例化位置排序。线性复杂度操作符支持高效的长上下文序列令牌建模。

Result: 实验表明DriveMamba在nuScenes和Bench2Drive数据集上表现优越，具有高效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DriveMamba在nuScenes和Bench2Drive数据集上的实验证明了其优越性、泛化能力和高效性。

Abstract: Recent advances towards End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) have been often devoted on integrating modular designs into a unified framework for joint optimization e.g. UniAD, which follow a sequential paradigm (i.e., perception-prediction-planning) based on separable Transformer decoders and rely on dense BEV features to encode scene representations. However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input. To this end, we propose DriveMamba, a Task-Centric Scalable paradigm for efficient E2E-AD, which integrates dynamic task relation modeling, implicit view correspondence learning and long-term temporal fusion into a single-stage Unified Mamba decoder. Specifically, both extracted image features and expected task outputs are converted into token-level sparse representations in advance, which are then sorted by their instantiated positions in 3D space. The linear-complexity operator enables efficient long-context sequential token modeling to capture task-related inter-dependencies simultaneously. Additionally, a bidirectional trajectory-guided "local-to-global" scan method is designed to preserve spatial locality from ego-perspective, thus facilitating the ego-planning. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superiority, generalizability and great efficiency of DriveMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVG是一种推理时方法，通过校正ODE动态解决频谱崩溃问题，在超分辨率和草图到图像任务中有效平衡结构保真与纹理恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准确定性反转（如DDIM）在源域频谱稀疏（如超分辨率、草图到图像）时失败，导致恢复的潜在信号低频化，目标采样锁定在过度平滑和纹理贫乏的生成中，称为频谱崩溃。随机替代方法尝试恢复噪声方差，但会破坏与输入的语义链接，导致结构漂移。

Method: 提出Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG)，通过在校正ODE动态时在结构梯度的零空间内强制理论高斯噪声幅度，来解决结构-纹理权衡问题。

Result: 在显微镜超分辨率（BBBC021）和草图到图像（Edges2Shoes）上的广泛实验表明，OVG有效恢复了逼真纹理，同时保持了结构保真度。

Conclusion: OVG（Orthogonal Variance Guidance）是一种在推理时校正ODE动态的方法，有效解决了结构-纹理权衡问题，在保持结构保真度的同时恢复了逼真的纹理。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion inversion provides a powerful framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity.

Motivation: 解决双向扫描中耦合的域偏移和几何错位问题，现有方法因亮度恒定假设限制对齐质量。

Method: PCReg-Net采用渐进式对比引导的注册框架，包含四个轻量级模块：注册U-Net、参考特征提取器、对比模块和细化U-Net。

Result: 在OR-PAM-Reg-4K数据集上，PCReg-Net实现了NCC 0.983、SSIM 0.982和PSNR 46.96 dB，实时速度下超越现有技术14 dB。

Conclusion: PCReg-Net显著提升了OR-PAM图像的对齐质量，实现了高保真度的输出，并在实时速度下超越了现有技术。

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality (NCC~$\leq 0.96$). We propose PCReg-Net, a progressive contrast-guided registration framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment through four lightweight modules: (1)~a registration U-Net for coarse alignment, (2)~a reference feature extractor capturing multi-scale structural cues, (3)~a contrast module that identifies residual misalignment by comparing coarse-registered and reference features, and (4)~a refinement U-Net with feature injection for high-fidelity output. We further propose the Temporal NCC (TNCC) and Temporal NCC Gap (TNCG) for reference-free evaluation of inter-frame temporal consistency. On OR-PAM-Reg-4K (432 test samples), PCReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.983, SSIM of 0.982, and PSNR of 46.96 dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 14 dB at real-time speed.

TL;DR: WildfireVLM利用AI框架结合卫星图像检测与语言驱动风险评估，提升野火监测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火对生态系统和人类活动的威胁日益加剧，早期检测因烟雾信号微弱、天气条件动态变化和大范围实时分析需求而具有挑战性。

Method: WildfireVLM采用YOLOv12检测卫星图像中的火区和烟羽，并结合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）生成风险评估和响应建议。

Result: 系统通过实时处理、可视化风险仪表盘和长期野火跟踪验证了其有效性，LLM-as-judge评估进一步确认了风险评估的质量。

Conclusion: WildfireVLM结合计算机视觉与语言推理，为可扩展的野火监测提供了创新解决方案，展示了AI在灾害管理中的潜力。

Abstract: Wildfires are a growing threat to ecosystems, human lives, and infrastructure, with their frequency and intensity rising due to climate change and human activities. Early detection is critical, yet satellite-based monitoring remains challenging due to faint smoke signals, dynamic weather conditions, and the need for real-time analysis over large areas. We introduce WildfireVLM, an AI framework that combines satellite imagery wildfire detection with language-driven risk assessment. We construct a labeled wildfire and smoke dataset using imagery from Landsat-8/9, GOES-16, and other publicly available Earth observation sources, including harmonized products with aligned spectral bands. WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种自动化评估绘画创造力的方法，通过微调视觉语言模型实现评分和反馈生成，实验显示高准确性和语义接近专家反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估艺术创造力是创造力研究和艺术教育的基础，但传统手动评分方法（如Torrance创造力测试）在大规模应用时耗时耗力。现有机器学习方法虽有一定效果，但主要依赖图像特征且缺乏解释性反馈。

Method: 研究使用包含1000幅人类绘画作品的数据集，每幅作品配有1-100分的评分和简短描述。通过微调Qwen2-VL-7B模型，并添加轻量级回归头，模型能够预测分数并生成与评分标准对齐的反馈。实验采用80/20的训练-测试划分。

Result: 实验显示，模型在100分制评分上达到Pearson r > 0.97和MAE约3.95的准确性。生成的反馈在语义上与专家评论接近（平均SBERT余弦相似度=0.798）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于视觉语言模型Qwen2-VL-7B的自动化创造力评估框架，通过多任务学习实现了对绘画作品的评分和反馈生成。实验结果表明，该方法在评分准确性（Pearson r > 0.97）和反馈质量（SBERT余弦相似度=0.798）上表现优异，为创造力研究和艺术教育提供了可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity is foundational to creativity research and arts education, yet manual scoring (e.g., Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) is labor-intensive at scale. Prior machine-learning approaches show promise for visual creativity scoring, but many rely mainly on image features and provide limited or no explanatory feedback. We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM测试时间缩放法则在探索中容易陷入特定思维模式的瓶颈，而并行思维可以缓解这一问题，但其在视觉领域的应用尚未解决。

Method: 提出了两种视觉分区策略，并整合了Pa-Attention和LPRoPE以保持路径独立性和推理多样性。

Result: 在V*、CountBench、RefCOCO和HallusionBench等基准数据集上验证了Visual Para-Thinker的有效性。

Conclusion: Visual Para-Thinker成功将并行推理的优势扩展到视觉领域，验证了其在多个基准数据集上的有效性。

Abstract: Existing LLM test-time scaling laws emphasize the emergence of self-reflective behaviors through extended reasoning length. Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern. By shifting from depth to parallelism, parallel thinking mitigates the narrowing of exploration. However, the extension of this paradigm to visual domain remains an open research question. In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing. Empirical results on benchmark datasets such as V*, CountBench, RefCOCO, and HallusionBench confirm that Visual Para-Thinker successfully extends the benefits of parallel reasoning to the visual domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在计算冗余、监督需求高和泛化能力有限的问题，弱监督方法虽降低标注成本但性能受限，因此提出ASTG框架以实现开放世界和无训练场景下的STVG任务。

Method: 通过构建两个专门代理SRA和TRA，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）协作完成目标管道的自主检索，采用提议-评估范式解耦时空推理并自动化管道提取、验证和时间定位过程。

Result: 在流行基准测试中，ASTG显著优于现有弱监督和零样本方法，并与部分全监督方法性能相当。

Conclusion: ASTG框架在STVG任务中表现出色，不仅优于现有的弱监督和零样本方法，还与一些全监督方法相媲美。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a target object or person in a video given a text query. Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods.

Motivation: 解决基于学习的雷达感知因大规模雷达数据集收集和标注的稀缺性和高成本而受限的问题。

Method: Sim2Radar框架通过结合单目深度估计、分割和视觉语言推理来推断物体材质，重建材料感知的3D场景，然后使用基于物理的射线追踪器模拟毫米波传播，参数化ITU-R电磁特性的菲涅尔反射模型。

Result: 在真实室内场景评估中，Sim2Radar通过迁移学习提升下游3D雷达感知：在合成数据上预训练雷达点云物体检测模型并在真实雷达数据上微调，3D AP（IoU 0.3）提升高达+3.7。

Conclusion: 物理基础的视觉驱动雷达模拟可以为雷达学习提供有效的几何先验，并在有限的真实数据监督下显著提升性能。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar provides reliable perception in visually degraded indoor environments (e.g., smoke, dust, and low light), but learning-based radar perception is bottlenecked by the scarcity and cost of collecting and annotating large-scale radar datasets. We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.

Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法缺乏对重要性和多样性平衡的系统性框架，导致效率不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)算法的IDPruner方法，无需注意力图即可实现一次性剪枝，兼容FlashAttention。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct上，IDPruner在剪枝75%令牌时保留95.18%基线性能，极端90%剪枝下仍保持86.40%。

Conclusion: IDPruner通过平衡视觉令牌的重要性和语义多样性，实现了在多种模型架构和多模态基准测试中的最优性能，显著提升了MLLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet they encounter significant computational bottlenecks due to the massive volume of visual tokens. Consequently, visual token pruning, which substantially reduces the token count, has emerged as a critical technique for accelerating MLLM inference. Existing approaches focus on token importance, diversity, or an intuitive combination of both, without a principled framework for their optimal integration. To address this issue, we first conduct a systematic analysis to characterize the trade-off between token importance and semantic diversity. Guided by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{I}mportance and \textbf{D}iversity Pruner (\textbf{IDPruner}), which leverages the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between these two objectives. Crucially, our method operates without requiring attention maps, ensuring full compatibility with FlashAttention and efficient deployment via one-shot pruning. We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\% even under an extreme 90\% pruning ratio.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSI dataset to test topological invariance, showing Eidos architecture excels in geometric tasks, supporting the 'Form-First' hypothesis that geometric integrity drives generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to isolate topological invariance (structural identity across affine transformations) from textural correlations that dominate standard vision benchmarks, to understand generalization in vision systems.

Method: The study uses the PolyShapes-Ideal (PSI) dataset with three diagnostic probes: polygon classification under noise, zero-shot font transfer from MNIST, and geometric collapse mapping under progressive deformation. The Eidos architecture is tested on these probes.

Result: The Eidos architecture achieves >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces without pre-training.

Conclusion: The results validate the 'Form-First' hypothesis, indicating that generalization in structurally constrained architectures depends on geometric integrity rather than statistical scale.

Abstract: We present the PolyShapes-Ideal (PSI) dataset, a suite of diagnostic benchmarks designed to isolate topological invariance -- the ability to maintain structural identity across affine transformations -- from the textural correlations that dominate standard vision benchmarks. Through three diagnostic probes (polygon classification under noise, zero-shot font transfer from MNIST, and geometric collapse mapping under progressive deformation), we demonstrate that the Eidos architecture achieves >99% accuracy on PSI and 81.67% zero-shot transfer across 30 unseen typefaces without pre-training. These results validate the "Form-First" hypothesis: generalization in structurally constrained architectures is a property of geometric integrity, not statistical scale.

Conclusion: 该研究验证了分层零样本架构在边缘自主性中的有效性，并提供了一个诊断框架，用于验证VLM在安全关键应用中的适用性。

Abstract: Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.

Method: 引入了统一的运动表示和整体4D锚定范式，构建共享4D空间以融合运动表示与视频潜在特征，并通过分层4D级监督强化这一过程。

Result: MotionWeaver在46小时多人视频数据集和300视频基准测试中表现优异，实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: MotionWeaver在多样人形形式、复杂交互和挑战性多人形场景中均表现出色，不仅在我们的基准测试中达到了最先进的结果，还能有效泛化。

Abstract: Character image animation, which synthesizes videos of reference characters driven by pose sequences, has advanced rapidly but remains largely limited to single-human settings. Existing methods struggle to generalize to multi-humanoid scenarios, which involve diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and frequent occlusions. We address this gap with two key innovations. First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios.

Conclusion: HiST-VLA模型通过分层时空设计和动态潜在正则化，显著提升了自动驾驶轨迹生成的可靠性和性能，在NAVSIM v2基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer promising capabilities for autonomous driving through multimodal understanding. However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.
  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark.

Method: 提出MedScope，一种工具使用的临床视频推理模型，通过粗到细的证据搜索和中间推理与目标工具调用的交替，优化了Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO)。

Result: MedScope在完整和细粒度视频理解基准测试中，领域内外评估均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedScope通过工具集成推理，为医疗AI代理提供了一种真正‘用视频思考’的路径，并在领域内外评估中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate meningioma classification is crucial for treatment planning and prognosis, and current methods lack effective integration of spatial-frequency domain features.

Method: A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights for combining spatial and frequency domain features, validated on a new MRI dataset.

Result: The method shows superior performance in meningioma classification across three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive weight feature fusion architecture significantly improves meningioma classification performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The biological behavior and treatment response of meningiomas depend on their grade, making an accurate diagnosis essential for treatment planning and prognosis assessment. We observed that the weighted fusion of spatial-frequency domain features significantly influences meningioma classification performance. Notably, the contribution of specific frequency bands obtained by discrete wavelet transform varies considerably across different images. A feature fusion architecture with adaptive weights of different frequency band information and spatial domain information is proposed for few-shot meningioma learning. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a new MRI dataset of meningiomas is introduced. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with existing state-of-the-art methods in three datasets.

Result: 证据表明，绿化比例对交通事故具有显著且稳健的负面因果效应（平均处理效应 = -6.38，p = 0.005）。这种保护效应在人口密集和社会脆弱性高的城市核心区最为显著。绿化显著减少了角度和追尾碰撞，但对弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的保护效果有限。

Conclusion: 研究提供了绿化作为潜在安全干预措施的因果证据，优先考虑危险的视觉环境，同时强调需要不同的设计优化以保护弱势道路使用者（VRUs）。

Abstract: Macroscopic traffic safety modeling aims to identify critical risk factors for regional crashes, thereby informing targeted policy interventions for safety improvement. However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.

Conclusion: FireRed-Image-Edit通过系统优化数据、训练方法和评估设计，在指令式图像编辑任务中达到了最先进的性能，并发布了代码、模型和基准套件以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present FireRed-Image-Edit, a diffusion transformer for instruction-based image editing that achieves state-of-the-art performance through systematic optimization of data curation, training methodology, and evaluation design. We construct a 1.6B-sample training corpus, comprising 900M text-to-image and 700M image editing pairs from diverse sources. After rigorous cleaning, stratification, auto-labeling, and two-stage filtering, we retain over 100M high-quality samples balanced between generation and editing, ensuring strong semantic coverage and instruction alignment. Our multi-stage training pipeline progressively builds editing capability via pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. To improve data efficiency, we introduce a Multi-Condition Aware Bucket Sampler for variable-resolution batching and Stochastic Instruction Alignment with dynamic prompt re-indexing. To stabilize optimization and enhance controllability, we propose Asymmetric Gradient Optimization for DPO, DiffusionNFT with layout-aware OCR rewards for text editing, and a differentiable Consistency Loss for identity preservation. We further establish REDEdit-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 15 editing categories, including newly introduced beautification and low-level enhancement tasks. Extensive experiments on REDEdit-Bench and public benchmarks (ImgEdit and GEdit) demonstrate competitive or superior performance against both open-source and proprietary systems. We release code, models, and the benchmark suite to support future research.

Conclusion: FOREST模型通过预测仓库存储后的布局，为仓库规划提供了有用的前瞻信号，且在负载质量评估和多存储推理任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Automated warehouses execute millions of stow operations, where robots place objects into storage bins. For these systems it is valuable to anticipate how a bin will look from the current observations and the planned stow behavior before real execution. We propose FOREST, a stow-intent-conditioned world model that represents bin states as item-aligned instance masks and uses a latent diffusion transformer to predict the post-stow configuration from the observed context. Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have made significant strides, producing impressive results in generating images from textual descriptions. However, creating a scalable pipeline for deploying these models in production remains a challenge. Achieving the right balance between automation and human feedback is critical to maintain both scale and quality. While automation can handle large volumes, human oversight is still an essential component to ensure that the generated images meet the desired standards and are aligned with the creative vision. This paper presents a new pipeline that offers a fully automated, scalable solution for generating marketing images of commercial products using text-to-image models. The proposed system maintains the quality and fidelity of images, while also introducing sufficient creative variation to adhere to marketing guidelines. By streamlining this process, we ensure a seamless blend of efficiency and human oversight, achieving a $30.77\%$ increase in marketing object fidelity using DINOV2 and a $52.00\%$ increase in human preference over the generated outcome.

Abstract: Brick kilns are a major source of air pollution and forced labor in South Asia, yet large-scale monitoring remains limited by sparse and outdated ground data. We study brick kiln detection at scale using high-resolution satellite imagery and curate a multi city zoom-20 (0.149 meters per pixel) resolution dataset comprising over 1.3 million image tiles across five regions in South and Central Asia. We propose ClimateGraph, a region-adaptive graph-based model that captures spatial and directional structure in kiln layouts, and evaluate it against established graph learning baselines. In parallel, we assess a remote sensing based detection pipeline and benchmark it against recent foundation models for satellite imagery. Our results highlight complementary strengths across graph, foundation, and remote sensing approaches, providing practical guidance for scalable brick kiln monitoring from satellite imagery.

Abstract: Automated image captioning using the content from the image is very appealing when done by harnessing the capability of computer vision and natural language processing. Extensive research has been done in the field with a major focus on the English language which gives the scope for further developments in the same with consideration of popular foreign languages. This research utilizes distinct models for translating the image caption into Hindi, the fourth most popular language across the world. Exploring the multi-modal architectures this research comprises local visual features, global visual features, attention mechanisms, and pre-trained models. Using google cloud translator on the image dataset from Flickr8k, Hindi image descriptions have been generated. Pre-trained CNNs like VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3 helped in retrieving image characteristics, while the uni-directional and bi-directional techniques of text encoding are used for the text encoding process. An additional Attention layer helps to generate a weight vector and, by multiplying it, combine image characteristics from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector. Bilingual evaluation understudy scores are used to compare the research outcome. Many experiments that serve as a baseline are done for the comparative analysis of the research. An image with a score of BLEU-1 is considered sufficient, whereas one with a score of BLEU-4 is considered to have fluid image captioning. For both BLEU scores, the attention-based bidirectional LSTM with VGG16 produced the best results of 0.59 and 0.19 respectively. The experiments conclude that researchs ability to produce relevant, semantically accurate image captions in Hindi. The research accomplishes the goals and future research can be guided by this research model.

Motivation: 解决现有缓存加速方法因静态重用计划或粗粒度启发式导致的时序漂移和缓存不对齐问题，从而提升生成质量。

Method: AdaCorrection利用轻量级时空信号估计缓存有效性，并自适应混合缓存和新鲜激活，无需额外监督或重新训练。

Result: 在图像和视频扩散基准测试中，AdaCorrection在保持接近原始FID的同时实现了适度加速，并持续提升生成性能。

Conclusion: AdaCorrection框架通过自适应偏移缓存校正，在保持高质量生成的同时实现了高效缓存重用，显著提升了Diffusion Transformers的推理效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity image and video generation but suffer from expensive inference due to their iterative denoising structure. While prior methods accelerate sampling by caching intermediate features, they rely on static reuse schedules or coarse-grained heuristics, which often lead to temporal drift and cache misalignment that significantly degrade generation quality. We introduce \textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration. Experiments on image and video diffusion benchmarks show that AdaCorrection consistently improves generation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在复杂场景下难以准确表征特征分布，导致估计偏差和纹理失真。本文旨在通过扩散模型的强大生成能力解决这些问题。

Method: 本文创新性地将扩散模型引入双通道盲图像分离，提出高效的DCDSM模型，并设计了小波抑制模块（WSM）以增强细节分离。

Result: DCDSM在雨雪去除任务中PSNR/SSIM分别达到35.0023 dB/0.9549和29.8108 dB/0.9243，复杂混合分离任务中平均PSNR和SSIM为25.0049 dB和0.7997，均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCDSM在解决雨雪残留去除和细节保留挑战方面表现出色，主客观评估均证实其优越性。

Abstract: Blind image separation (BIS) refers to the inverse problem of simultaneously estimating and restoring multiple independent source images from a single observation image under conditions of unknown mixing mode and without prior knowledge of the source images. Traditional methods relying on statistical independence assumptions or CNN/GAN variants struggle to characterize complex feature distributions in real scenes, leading to estimation bias, texture distortion, and artifact residue under strong noise and nonlinear mixing. This paper innovatively introduces diffusion models into dual-channel BIS, proposing an efficient Dual-Channel Diffusion Separation Model (DCDSM). DCDSM leverages diffusion models' powerful generative capability to learn source image feature distributions and reconstruct feature structures effectively. A novel Wavelet Suppression Module (WSM) is designed within the dual-branch reverse denoising process, forming an interactive separation network that enhances detail separation by exploiting the mutual coupling noise characteristic between source images. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing rain/snow and complex mixtures demonstrate that DCDSM achieves state-of-the-art performance: 1) In image restoration tasks, it obtains PSNR/SSIM values of 35.0023 dB/0.9549 and 29.8108 dB/0.9243 for rain and snow removal respectively, outperforming Histoformer and LDRCNet by 1.2570 dB/0.9272 dB (PSNR) and 0.0262/0.0289 (SSIM) on average; 2) For complex mixture separation, the restored dual-source images achieve average PSNR and SSIM of 25.0049 dB and 0.7997, surpassing comparative methods by 4.1249 dB and 0.0926. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm DCDSM's superiority in addressing rain/snow residue removal and detail preservation challenges.

TL;DR: 提出一种无参考评估框架，通过OCR和视觉蕴含自动化评估流程图图像到代码生成的质量，验证显示高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生产环境中，由于缺乏真实代码参考，评估流程图图像到代码生成的质量具有挑战性。

Method: 引入两个自动化指标：$	ext{Recall}_{	ext{OCR}}$（通过OCR提取输入图像文本作为代理参考）和$	ext{Precision}_{	ext{VE}}$（通过视觉蕴含检测幻觉元素），并计算其调和平均数$	ext{F1}_{	ext{OCR-VE}}$作为统一质量评分。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的无参考评估框架在流程图图像到代码生成的质量监控中表现出高可靠性，与真实指标有强相关性，可作为生产环境中持续质量监控的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in document processing pipelines to convert flowchart images into structured code (e.g., Mermaid). In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles serve as primary sensing platforms for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster response, making aerial object detection a central problem in applied computer vision. Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在CXR-LT 2026挑战中表现优异，尤其在长尾多标签分类和零样本OOD识别任务上取得了领先成绩。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) classification in clinical practice is often limited by imperfect supervision, arising from (i) extreme long-tailed multi-label disease distributions and (ii) missing annotations for rare or previously unseen findings. The CXR-LT 2026 challenge addresses these issues on a PadChest-based benchmark with a 36-class label space split into 30 in-distribution classes for training and 6 out-of-distribution (OOD) classes for zero-shot evaluation. We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training. Evaluated with macro-averaged mean Average Precision (mAP), our method achieves strong performance on both tasks, ranking first on the public leaderboard of the development phase.

Motivation: 室内无人机等自主代理需要在实时学习新物体类别的同时限制灾难性遗忘，这推动了类增量学习（CIL）的研究。然而，大多数无人机数据集专注于室外场景，提供的室内视频时间一致性有限。

Method: 使用YOLOv11-nano作为资源高效的检测器，在部署受限的无人机平台上评估了三种基于重放的CIL策略：经验重放（ER）、最大干扰检索（MIR）和遗忘感知重放（FAR）。

Result: 在严格的内存预算（5-10%重放）下，FAR表现优于其他方法，在5%重放下平均准确率（ACC，$mAP_{50-95}$跨增量）达到82.96%。梯度加权类激活映射（Grad-CAM）分析显示，混合场景中注意力在类别间转移，这与无人机定位质量下降相关。

Conclusion: 本研究贡献了一个具有时间一致性的室内无人机视频数据集，并在有限的重放预算下评估了基于重放的持续学习方法。实验表明，基于重放的持续学习可以有效地应用于边缘空中系统。

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as indoor drones must learn new object classes in real-time while limiting catastrophic forgetting, motivating Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). However, most unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) datasets focus on outdoor scenes and offer limited temporally coherent indoor videos. We introduce an indoor dataset of $14,400$ frames capturing inter-drone and ground vehicle footage, annotated via a semi-automatic workflow with a $98.6\%$ first-pass labeling agreement before final manual verification. Using this dataset, we benchmark 3 replay-based CIL strategies: Experience Replay (ER), Maximally Interfered Retrieval (MIR), and Forgetting-Aware Replay (FAR), using YOLOv11-nano as a resource-efficient detector for deployment-constrained UAV platforms. Under tight memory budgets ($5-10\%$ replay), FAR performs better than the rest, achieving an average accuracy (ACC, $mAP_{50-95}$ across increments) of $82.96\%$ with $5\%$ replay. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis shows attention shifts across classes in mixed scenes, which is associated with reduced localization quality for drones. The experiments further demonstrate that replay-based continual learning can be effectively applied to edge aerial systems. Overall, this work contributes an indoor UAV video dataset with preserved temporal coherence and an evaluation of replay-based CIL under limited replay budgets.

Motivation: 解决在可穿戴设备上部署Text VQA时的基本矛盾：文本识别需要高分辨率视频，但流式传输高质量视频会消耗大量电池并导致热节流，且现有模型难以在实时流中跨多帧保持连贯的时间上下文。

Method: 采用混合架构，选择性高分辨率OCR处理与低分辨率视频流式传输结合，利用文本识别和视觉推理对分辨率的不对称需求。

Result: 在五个任务类别的文本VQA样本基准测试中，系统以0.49倍于全分辨率流式传输的功耗实现了72%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种混合架构，通过在设备上选择性进行高分辨率OCR处理，同时流式传输低分辨率视频以获取视觉上下文，从而在资源受限的可穿戴设备上实现持续的文本视觉问答（Text VQA）会话，且不牺牲文本理解质量。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding and reasoning about visual content, particularly in tasks involving text recognition and text-based visual question answering (Text VQA). However, deploying Text VQA on wearable devices faces a fundamental tension: text recognition requires high-resolution video, but streaming high-quality video drains battery and causes thermal throttling. Moreover, existing models struggle to maintain coherent temporal context when processing text across multiple frames in real-time streams. We observe that text recognition and visual reasoning have asymmetric resolution requirements - OCR needs fine detail while scene understanding tolerates coarse features. We exploit this asymmetry with a hybrid architecture that performs selective high-resolution OCR on-device while streaming low-resolution video for visual context. On a benchmark of text-based VQA samples across five task categories, our system achieves 72% accuracy at 0.49x the power consumption of full-resolution streaming, enabling sustained VQA sessions on resource-constrained wearables without sacrificing text understanding quality.

Result: 实验结果显示，不同模型在不同任务中表现各异：VideoPrism在视觉语音运动学和面部表情任务中表现优异，V-JEPA在上肢运动任务中表现最佳，TimeSformer在节奏性任务（如手指敲击）中竞争力强。整体AUC为76.4-85.3%，准确率为71.5-80.6%，特异性高达90.3%，但敏感性较低（43.2-57.3%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为基于视频基础模型的帕金森病筛查建立了严格的基准，并提供了在远程神经监测中选择合适任务和架构的路线图。

Abstract: Remote, video-based assessments offer a scalable pathway for Parkinson's disease (PD) screening. While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

TL;DR: SpargeAttention2通过混合掩码规则和蒸馏微调，实现高稀疏性和加速，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究训练稀疏注意力的三个关键问题：常见掩码规则的失败情况、可训练稀疏注意力为何能达到更高稀疏性，以及扩散损失微调的局限性。

Method: 提出SpargeAttention2，包括混合掩码规则、高效的可训练稀疏注意力实现和蒸馏启发的微调目标。

Result: 在视频扩散模型上，SpargeAttention2达到95%的注意力稀疏性和16.2倍的注意力加速，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SpargeAttention2是一种可训练的稀疏注意力方法，通过结合Top-k和Top-p的混合掩码规则、高效的可训练稀疏注意力实现以及蒸馏启发的微调目标，实现了高稀疏性而不降低生成质量。

Abstract: Many training-free sparse attention methods are effective for accelerating diffusion models. Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention. Experiments on video diffusion models show that SpargeAttention2 reaches 95% attention sparsity and a 16.2x attention speedup while maintaining generation quality, consistently outperforming prior sparse attention methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种整合基于物理渲染的3D高斯散射方法，显著提升了夜间自动驾驶场景的重建质量，并在实时渲染中保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于NeRF和3DGS的方法在正常光照条件下取得了逼真的建模效果，但在低光照驾驶场景中由于复杂的照明和外观条件，性能下降明显。因此，需要一种新方法来提升夜间场景的重建质量。

Method: 该方法通过将基于物理的渲染整合到复合场景高斯表示中，并联合优化基于双向反射分布函数（BRDF）的材料属性，通过全局光照模块显式建模漫反射分量，并通过各向异性球面高斯函数建模镜面反射分量。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过将基于物理的渲染整合到3D高斯散射中，显著提升了夜间自动驾驶场景的重建质量，并在实时渲染方面保持了优越性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on scene reconstruction under nighttime conditions in autonomous driving simulation. Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 提出PCC框架，通过对抗学习隐藏BEV特征中的视觉线索，保护协作车辆的隐私，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶协作感知系统中因共享感知信息而导致的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 基于共享的BEV特征，设计了一个隐藏网络以防止图像重建网络从共享特征中恢复输入图像，并采用对抗学习机制进行训练。感知网络与隐藏网络集成并端到端优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，PCC框架有效降低了重建图像的质量，同时对分割性能影响很小。

Conclusion: 提出的PCC框架在保护隐私的同时，对语义分割性能影响最小，为协作车辆提供了有效的隐私保护。

Abstract: Cooperative perception systems for autonomous driving aim to overcome the limited perception range of a single vehicle by communicating with adjacent agents to share sensing information. While this improves perception performance, these systems also face a significant privacy-leakage issue, as sensitive visual content can potentially be reconstructed from the shared data. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy-Concealing Cooperation (PCC) framework for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation. Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: Diff-Aid是一种轻量级推理时方法，通过动态调整文本与图像交互，提升T2I扩散模型的生成质量和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在复杂文本描述下的生成能力不足，主要由于文本和视觉特征交互不足，且现有方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出Diff-Aid，通过自适应调整每令牌文本和图像交互，动态优化不同Transformer块和去噪阶段的交互。

Result: 在SD 3.5和FLUX等基线模型上，Diff-Aid在提示遵循、视觉质量和人类偏好等指标上均表现一致提升。

Conclusion: Diff-Aid作为一种轻量级的推理时方法，能够自适应调整文本和图像交互，显著提升生成质量和语义对齐，并可无缝集成到下游应用中。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.

Conclusion: TwInS框架通过生物启发的双流交互学习，成功实现了场景解析与几何视觉任务的联合优化，并在多个公开数据集上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system, which operates on two parallel yet interactive streams for contextual and spatial understanding, this article presents Two Interactive Streams (TwInS), a novel bio-inspired joint learning framework capable of simultaneously performing scene parsing and geometric vision tasks. TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing. To eliminate the dependence on costly human-annotated correspondence ground truth, TwInS is further equipped with a tailored semi-supervised training strategy, which unleashes the potential of large-scale multi-view data and enables continuous self-evolution without requiring ground-truth correspondences. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TwInS's core components and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: 现有方法使用预定义的缩放因子调整视觉注意力，可能导致增强不足或过度，从而无法有效解决或引发新的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE)来估计幻觉风险，并基于VGE动态调整视觉注意力增强的强度。

Result: AdaVBoost在多个大型视觉语言模型和幻觉基准测试中表现显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AdaVBoost通过动态调整视觉注意力增强的强度，显著减少了大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Visual attention boosting has emerged as a promising direction for mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where existing methods primarily focus on where to boost by applying a predefined scaling to the attention of method-specific visual tokens during autoregressive generation. In this paper, we identify a fundamental trade-off in these methods: a predefined scaling factor can be too weak at some generation steps, leaving hallucinations unresolved, yet too strong at others, leading to new hallucinations. Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step. Extensive experiments show that AdaVBoost significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple LVLMs and hallucination benchmarks.

Motivation: 为了解决视频问答中均匀采样帧的低效问题，REVISE旨在通过稀疏视频推理提高准确性和效率。

Method: REVISE采用多轮代理机制，选择少量信息丰富的帧，维护摘要作为状态，并支持即插即用的专有视觉语言模型。通过EAGER（证据调整增益）进行强化微调，包含三个奖励项：置信增益、摘要充分性和正确提前停止。

Result: 在多个VQA基准测试中，REVISE在减少帧数、轮次和提示令牌的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: REVISE通过选择性采样帧、维护跨轮次的状态摘要和提前停止机制，显著提高了视频问答的准确性和效率，同时减少了帧数、轮次和提示令牌的使用。

Abstract: We present \revise (\underline{Re}asoning with \underline{Vi}deo \underline{S}parsity), a multi-round agent for video question answering (VQA). Instead of uniformly sampling frames, \revise selects a small set of informative frames, maintains a summary-as-state across rounds, and stops early when confident. It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.

Motivation: 由于外科医生和手术过程中视觉解读的差异性，现有AI模型难以泛化，限制了评估、训练和可靠AI系统的发展。

Method: 使用自监督多教师蒸馏框架，在超过21种手术的400万帧视频上训练ZEN模型。

Result: ZEN在20个下游任务中表现优于现有手术基础模型，并展现出强大的跨手术泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZEN模型为手术场景理解提供了统一的表示方法，支持未来在术中辅助和手术训练评估中的应用。

Abstract: In minimally invasive surgery, clinical decisions depend on real-time visual interpretation, yet intraoperative perception varies substantially across surgeons and procedures. This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.

Conclusion: DCDM通过分解视频一致性建模的三个关键挑战，并采用统一的视频生成框架，有效提升了语义、几何和身份一致性。

Abstract: Recent video generative models have demonstrated impressive visual fidelity, yet they often struggle with semantic, geometric, and identity consistency. In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges.

Abstract: We introduce KorMedMCQA-V, a Korean medical licensing-exam-style multimodal multiple-choice question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset consists of 1,534 questions with 2,043 associated images from Korean Medical Licensing Examinations (2012-2023), with about 30% containing multiple images requiring cross-image evidence integration. Images cover clinical modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT), electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound, endoscopy, and other medical visuals. We benchmark over 50 VLMs across proprietary and open-source categories-spanning general-purpose, medical-specialized, and Korean-specialized families-under a unified zero-shot evaluation protocol. The best proprietary model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) achieves 96.9% accuracy, the best open-source model (Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking) 83.7%, and the best Korean-specialized model (VARCO-VISION-2.0-14B) only 43.2%. We further find that reasoning-oriented model variants gain up to +20 percentage points over instruction-tuned counterparts, medical domain specialization yields inconsistent gains over strong general-purpose baselines, all models degrade on multi-image questions, and performance varies notably across imaging modalities. By complementing the text-only KorMedMCQA benchmark, KorMedMCQA-V forms a unified evaluation suite for Korean medical reasoning across text-only and multimodal conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在床边时间和操作者努力受限的条件下，支持临床决策的POCUS需要高效的数据采集策略。

Method: 将POCUS建模为顺序采集问题：RL代理在每一步选择下一个视图或终止采集。终止时，共享多视图Transformer执行多任务推断，输出高斯预测分布，驱动奖励以平衡诊断收益与采集成本。

Result: 在1,820项测试研究中，该方法在减少32%视频使用的情况下，匹配完整研究性能，实现77.2%的平均平衡准确率（bACC）。

Conclusion: 患者定制、成本感知的数据采集策略可以优化POCUS工作流程，同时保持决策质量，生成适合床边使用的可解释扫描路径。该框架可扩展到其他心脏终点指标，值得进行前瞻性评估以实现临床整合。

Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiography with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) must support clinical decision-making under tight bedside time and operator-effort constraints. We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use. The framework is extensible to additional cardiac endpoints and merits prospective evaluation for clinical integration.

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在植物病理学应用中存在显著不足，LeafBench作为一个严格的评估框架，对于推动AI辅助植物病害诊断的方法学进步至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

Conclusion: EchoTorrent通过多教师训练、自适应CFG校准、混合长尾强制和VAE解码器优化，显著提升了多模态视频生成的实时性和稳定性，解决了效率与性能的权衡问题。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal video generation models have achieved high visual quality, but their prohibitive latency and limited temporal stability hinder real-time deployment. Streaming inference exacerbates these issues, leading to pronounced multimodal degradation, such as spatial blurring, temporal drift, and lip desynchronization, which creates an unresolved efficiency-performance trade-off. To this end, we propose EchoTorrent, a novel schema with a fourfold design: (1) Multi-Teacher Training fine-tunes a pre-trained model on distinct preference domains to obtain specialized domain experts, which sequentially transfer domain-specific knowledge to a student model; (2) Adaptive CFG Calibration (ACC-DMD), which calibrates the audio CFG augmentation errors in DMD via a phased spatiotemporal schedule, eliminating redundant CFG computations and enabling single-pass inference per step; (3) Hybrid Long Tail Forcing, which enforces alignment exclusively on tail frames during long-horizon self-rollout training via a causal-bidirectional hybrid architecture, effectively mitigates spatiotemporal degradation in streaming mode while enhancing fidelity to reference frames; and (4) VAE Decoder Refiner through pixel-domain optimization of the VAE decoder to recover high-frequency details while circumventing latent-space ambiguities. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.

Abstract: Environmental pollution is a critical global issue, with recycling emerging as one of the most viable solutions. This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183. This study could contribute to the efficiency of waste sorting at Material Recovery Facility, facilitating better raw material acquisition for recycling with minimal human intervention and enhancing the overall throughput.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的WDLoRA多模态生成框架显著提升了CCM图像合成的视觉保真度和结构完整性，同时保留了临床生物标志物，有效缓解了医学AI中的数据瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) is a sensitive tool for assessing small-fiber damage in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), yet the development of robust, automated deep learning-based diagnostic models is limited by scarce labelled data and fine-grained variability in corneal nerve morphology. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data. When used to train automated diagnostic models, the synthetic dataset improves downstream diagnostic accuracy by 2.1% and segmentation performance by 2.2%, validating the framework's potential to alleviate data bottlenecks in medical AI.

Abstract: Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.

Conclusion: RGA-Net 通过计算视觉增强，为更可靠、更安全的机器人手术系统迈出了重要一步，未来可通过临床试验进一步验证其实际效益。

Abstract: Robotic surgical systems rely heavily on high-quality visual feedback for precise teleoperation; yet, surgical smoke from energy-based devices significantly degrades endoscopic video feeds, compromising the human-robot interface and surgical outcomes. This paper presents RGA-Net (Reciprocal Gating and Attention-fusion Network), a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for smoke removal in robotic surgery workflows. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures. These practical benefits could be further validated through future clinical trials involving surgeon usability assessments. The proposed framework represents a significant step toward more reliable and safer robotic surgical systems through computational vision enhancement.

Motivation: 现有基于查询的检测器在处理任意方向物体（尤其是纹理信息有限的小物体）时性能受限，主要由于几何特征利用不足和阶段间匹配不一致。

Method: 设计了Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder以增强物体相关特征，并开发了Momentum-based Bipartite Matching方案来稳定阶段间匹配。

Result: 在DOTA-V1.0数据集上，使用Swin-T骨干网络的单尺度设置下，AP$_{50}$达到78.00%。

Conclusion: IGOFormer通过显式整合内在几何特征和增强阶段间匹配稳定性，显著提升了面向任意方向物体的检测性能，尤其在航空图像中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as segmentation, anomaly detection, and high-quality synthetic data generation. These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans. Our results demonstrate that the VAE successfully captures essential brain features while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. The latent space exhibits clear clustering patterns, particularly in distinguishing individuals with Down syndrome from euploid controls.

Conclusion: 现有方法在OOD场景下存在局限性，为未来生产级文本到运动模型的设计和评估提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Most existing evaluations of text-to-motion generation focus on in-distribution textual inputs and a limited set of evaluation criteria, which restricts their ability to systematically assess model generalization and motion generation capabilities under complex out-of-distribution (OOD) textual conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a benchmark specifically designed for OOD text-to-motion evaluation, which includes a comprehensive analysis of 14 representative baseline models and the two datasets derived from evaluation results. Specifically, we construct an OOD prompt dataset consisting of 1,025 textual descriptions. Based on this prompt dataset, we introduce a unified evaluation framework that integrates LLM-based Evaluation, Multi-factor Motion evaluation, and Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. Our experimental results reveal that while different baseline models demonstrate strengths in areas such as text-to-motion semantic alignment, motion generalizability, and physical quality, most models struggle to achieve strong performance with Fine-grained Accuracy Evaluation. These findings highlight the limitations of existing methods in OOD scenarios and offer practical guidance for the design and evaluation of future production-level text-to-motion models.

Result: OmniScience数据集将图像-文本多模态相似度从0.769提升至0.956，并在Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型上实现了MM-MT-Bench（+0.378）和MMMU（+0.140）的显著提升。

Conclusion: OmniScience数据集通过动态模型路由重标注流程和严格的质量过滤，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在科学图像理解上的性能，验证了其在多个基准测试中的优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models demonstrate strong performance on natural image understanding, yet exhibit limited capability in interpreting scientific images, including but not limited to schematic diagrams, experimental characterizations, and analytical charts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in open-source MLLMs. The gap largely stems from existing datasets with limited domain coverage, coarse structural annotations, and weak semantic grounding. We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding. Under this setting, Qwen2.5-VL-3B model finetuned on OmniScience show substantial gains over baselines, achieving a gain of 0.378 on MM-MT-Bench and a gain of 0.140 on MMMU.

Abstract: Quantitative biomechanical analysis is essential for clinical diagnosis and injury prevention but is often restricted to laboratories due to the high cost of optical motion capture systems. While multi-view video approaches have lowered barriers, they remain impractical for home-based scenarios requiring monocular capture. This paper presents SAM4Dcap, an open-source, end-to-end framework for estimating biomechanical metrics from monocular video without additional training. SAM4Dcap integrates the temporally consistent 4D human mesh recovery of SAM-Body4D with the OpenSim biomechanical solver. The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain. By bridging advanced computer vision with established biomechanical simulation, SAM4Dcap provides a flexible, accessible foundation for non-laboratory motion analysis.

Conclusion: Offline-Poly 在 nuScenes 和 KITTI 数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其灵活性、通用性和模块化有效性。

Abstract: Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理奖励和强化学习微调，显著提高了生成舞蹈动作的物理合理性，使其更逼真且美观。

Abstract: Despite advances in dance generation, most methods are trained in the skeletal domain and ignore mesh-level physical constraints. As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) change detection methods can extract critical information on surface dynamics and are an essential means for humans to understand changes in the earth's surface and environment. Among these methods, semantic change detection (SCD) can more effectively interpret the multi-class information contained in bi-temporal RS imagery, providing semantic-level predictions that support dynamic change monitoring. However, due to the limited semantic understanding capability of the model and the inherent complexity of the SCD tasks, existing SCD methods face significant challenges in both performance and paradigm complexity. In this paper, we propose PerASCD, a SCD method driven by RS foundation model PerA, designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic understanding and overall performance. We introduce a modular Cascaded Gated Decoder (CG-Decoder) that simplifies complex SCD decoding pipelines while promoting effective multi-level feature interaction and fusion. In addition, we propose a Soft Semantic Consistency Loss (SSCLoss) to mitigate the numerical instability commonly encountered during SCD training. We further explore the applicability of multiple existing RS foundation models on the SCD task when equipped with the proposed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our decoder not only effectively simplifies the paradigm of SCD, but also achieves seamless adaptation across various vision encoders. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, validating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/SathShen/PerASCD.git.

TL;DR: DiWR是一种单流程方法，通过优化广义绕数场，从复杂点云中重建水密表面，无需预处理且效果优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对非均匀采样、噪声和异常值的无定向点云，传统方法依赖多阶段预处理，DiWR旨在通过单一流程解决这些问题。

Method: DiWR 使用广义绕数场作为目标隐式表示，并在单一流程中联合优化点定向、每点面积权重和置信系数。通过最小化诱导绕数场的Dirichlet能量及基于GWN的额外约束，实现重建。

Result: 实验表明，DiWR在3D高斯泼溅和受损图形基准测试中，能重建出合理的水密表面，且优于对比方法。

Conclusion: DiWR 是一种有效的单流程方法，能够在无需预处理的情况下，从非均匀采样、含噪声和异常值的无定向点云中重建水密表面，表现优于传统多阶段流程和最近的联合定向重建方法。

Abstract: We propose Dirichlet Winding Reconstruction (DiWR), a robust method for reconstructing watertight surfaces from unoriented point clouds with non-uniform sampling, noise, and outliers. Our method uses the generalized winding number (GWN) field as the target implicit representation and jointly optimizes point orientations, per-point area weights, and confidence coefficients in a single pipeline. The optimization minimizes the Dirichlet energy of the induced winding field together with additional GWN-based constraints, allowing DiWR to compensate for non-uniform sampling, reduce the impact of noise, and downweight outliers during reconstruction, with no reliance on separate preprocessing. We evaluate DiWR on point clouds from 3D Gaussian Splatting, a computer-vision pipeline, and corrupted graphics benchmarks. Experiments show that DiWR produces plausible watertight surfaces on these challenging inputs and outperforms both traditional multi-stage pipelines and recent joint orientation-reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度动态机制和视觉基础模型的多模态先验，显著提升了单目视频下的4D重建质量，实现了准确且全局一致的动态场景重建。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic scenes from casual videos is critical for scalable robot learning, yet four-dimensional (4D) reconstruction under strictly monocular settings remains highly ill-posed. To address this challenge, our key insight is that real-world dynamics exhibits a multi-scale regularity from object to particle level. To this end, we design the multi-scale dynamics mechanism that factorizes complex motion fields. Within this formulation, we propose Gaussian sequences with multi-scale dynamics, a novel representation for dynamic 3D Gaussians derived through compositions of multi-level motion. This layered structure substantially alleviates ambiguity of reconstruction and promotes physically plausible dynamics. We further incorporate multi-modal priors from vision foundation models to establish complementary supervision, constraining the solution space and improving the reconstruction fidelity. Our approach enables accurate and globally consistent 4D reconstruction from monocular casual videos. Experiments of dynamic novel-view synthesis (NVS) on benchmark and real-world manipulation datasets demonstrate considerable improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: VAR-3D通过集成视图感知的3D VQ-VAE和渲染监督训练策略，显著提升了文本到3D生成的几何一致性和视觉保真度，实验证明其在生成质量和文本-3D对齐方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in auto-regressive transformers have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling. However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment.

Conclusion: RPGD提供了一种实用且自动化的解决方案，用于大规模3D HPE数据集采集的可靠外参标定。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RPGD (RANSAC-P3P Gradient Descent), a human-pose-driven extrinsic calibration framework that robustly aligns MoCap-based 3D skeletal data with monocular or multi-view RGB cameras using only natural human motion. RPGD formulates extrinsic calibration as a coarse-to-fine problem tailored to human poses, combining the global robustness of RANSAC-P3P with Gradient-Descent-based refinement. We evaluate RPGD on three large-scale public 3D HPE datasets as well as on a self-collected in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that RPGD consistently recovers extrinsic parameters with accuracy comparable to the provided ground truth, achieving sub-pixel MPJPE reprojection error even in challenging, noisy settings. These results indicate that RPGD provides a practical and automatic solution for reliable extrinsic calibration of large-scale 3D HPE dataset collection.

Abstract: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.

Abstract: Ultrasound denoising is essential for mitigating speckle-induced degradations, thereby enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic reliability. Nevertheless, because speckle patterns inherently encode both texture and fine anatomical details, effectively suppressing noise while preserving structural fidelity remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a prior-guided hierarchical instance-pixel contrastive learning model for ultrasound denoising, designed to promote noise-invariant and structure-aware feature representations by maximizing the separability between noisy and clean samples at both pixel and instance levels. Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority.

<details>

Motivation: 大多数VIO评估侧重于理想传感器行为，而忽视了实际工业环境中传感器持续退化的影响，因此需要更深入理解这些条件下的VIO表现。

Method: 通过系统性的故障注入和定量评估，研究了视觉和惯性传感器在不同操作状态下的退化影响。

Result: 研究发现视觉传感器退化导致的姿态误差通常在厘米级别，而惯性传感器退化可能导致轨迹偏差达到数百至数千米。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在XR系统设计和评估中需要更加重视惯性传感器的可靠性，尤其是在实际工业环境中。

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) systems deployed in industrial and operational settings rely on Visual--Inertial Odometry (VIO) for continuous six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking, yet these environments often involve sensing conditions that deviate from ideal assumptions. Despite this, most VIO evaluations emphasize nominal sensor behavior, leaving the effects of sustained sensor degradation under operational conditions insufficiently understood. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters. These observations motivate greater emphasis on inertial reliability in the evaluation and design of XR systems for real-life industrial settings.

Abstract: We introduce a video diffusion model for high-fidelity, causal, and real-time video generation under ultra-low-bitrate semantic communication constraints. Our approach utilizes lossy semantic video coding to transmit the semantic scene structure, complemented by a stream of highly compressed, low-resolution frames that provide sufficient texture information to preserve fidelity. Building on these inputs, we introduce a modular video diffusion model that contains Semantic Control, Restoration Adapter, and Temporal Adapter. We further introduce an efficient temporal distillation procedure that enables extension to real-time and causal synthesis, reducing trainable parameters by 300x and training time by 2x, while adhering to communication constraints. Evaluated across diverse datasets, the framework achieves strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.0003 bpp), outperforming classical, neural, and generative baselines in extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Global solvers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D vision, offering certifiable solutions to nonconvex geometric optimization problems traditionally addressed by local or heuristic methods. This survey presents the first systematic review of global solvers in geometric vision, unifying the field through a comprehensive taxonomy of three core paradigms: Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Convex Relaxation (CR), and Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC). We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection. We identify critical future directions: scaling algorithms while maintaining guarantees, integrating data-driven priors with certifiable optimization, establishing standardized benchmarks, and addressing societal implications for safety-critical deployment. By consolidating theoretical foundations, practical advances, and broader impacts, this survey provides a unified perspective and roadmap toward certifiable, trustworthy perception for real-world applications.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common and life-threatening condition in elderly patients, often treated with Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Despite procedural advances, paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) remains one of the most frequent post-TAVI complications, with a proven impact on long-term prognosis.
  In this work, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the occurrence of PVR from preoperative cardiac CT. To this end, a dataset of preoperative TAVI patients was collected, and 3D convolutional neural networks were trained on isotropic CT volumes. The results achieved suggest that volumetric deep learning can capture subtle anatomical features from pre-TAVI imaging, opening new perspectives for personalized risk assessment and procedural optimization.

Abstract: Articulated objects are central to interactive 3D applications, including embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, where functional part decomposition and kinematic motion are essential. Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive workflow for generating and validating a synthetic dataset designed for robotic surgery instrument segmentation. A 3D reconstruction of the Da Vinci robotic arms was refined and animated in Autodesk Maya through a fully automated Python-based pipeline capable of producing photorealistic, labeled video sequences. Each scene integrates randomized motion patterns, lighting variations, and synthetic blood textures to mimic intraoperative variability while preserving pixel-accurate ground truth masks. To validate the realism and effectiveness of the generated data, several segmentation models were trained under controlled ratios of real and synthetic data. Results demonstrate that a balanced composition of real and synthetic samples significantly improves model generalization compared to training on real data only, while excessive reliance on synthetic data introduces a measurable domain shift. The proposed framework provides a reproducible and scalable tool for surgical computer vision, supporting future research in data augmentation, domain adaptation, and simulation-based pretraining for robotic-assisted surgery.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance on computer vision benchmarks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still fall short of adequately modeling human visual behavior, as measured by error consistency and shape bias. Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \emph{generative} -- rather than \emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.
  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.
  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency.

Conclusion: 模型与人类在颜色恒常性任务中表现出高度一致的行为，尤其是在基线条件下，且当局部环绕或空间平均颜色线索被移除时，两者均表现出相似的性能下降。

Abstract: We previously investigated color constancy in photorealistic virtual reality (VR) and developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that predicts reflectance from rendered images. Here, we combine both approaches to compare and study a model and human performance with respect to established color constancy mechanisms: local surround, maximum flux and spatial mean. Rather than evaluating the model against physical ground truth, model performance was assessed using the same achromatic object selection task employed in the human experiments. The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance. We then applied transfer learning, fine-tuning only the network's decoder on images from the baseline VR condition. To parallel the human experiment, the model's output was used to perform the same achromatic object selection task across all conditions. Results show a strong correspondence between the model and human behavior. Both achieved high constancy under baseline conditions and showed similar, condition-dependent performance declines when the local surround or spatial mean color cues were removed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MamaDino通过结合卷积和Transformer的互补优势及显式对侧不对称建模，在低分辨率乳腺X光片上实现了与Mirai相当的3年乳腺癌风险预测性能，且输入像素减少13倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习系统（如Mirai）通常使用卷积主干、高分辨率输入和简单的多视图融合，缺乏对侧不对称的显式建模。研究者假设结合互补的归纳偏置（卷积和Transformer）和显式对侧不对称建模可以在低分辨率图像上实现与最先进系统相当的预测性能。

Method: MamaDino是一种乳腺X光片感知的多视图注意力DINO模型，融合了冻结的自监督DINOv3 ViT-S特征和可训练的CNN编码器，通过BilateralMixer聚合双侧乳腺信息，输出3年乳腺癌风险评分。

Result: MamaDino在内部和外部测试中均与Mirai表现相当，且输入像素减少了约13倍。添加BilateralMixer后，内部测试的AUC从0.713提升至0.736，外部测试从0.666提升至0.677，性能在不同年龄、种族、扫描仪、肿瘤类型和分级中表现一致。

Conclusion: MamaDino通过结合卷积和Transformer的互补归纳偏置，以及显式的对侧不对称建模，在低分辨率（512x512）乳腺X光片上实现了与Mirai相当的3年乳腺癌风险预测性能，表明在更结构化的方式下使用较少细节的图像可以恢复最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening programmes increasingly seek to move from one-size-fits-all interval to risk-adapted and personalized strategies. Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry.
  We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy.
  We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site.
  At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in multimodal learning within computational pathology. Existing models primarily rely on vision and language modalities; however, language alone lacks molecular specificity and offers limited pathological supervision, leading to representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose STAMP, a Spatial Transcriptomics-Augmented Multimodal Pathology representation learning framework that integrates spatially-resolved gene expression profiles to enable molecule-guided joint embedding of pathology images and transcriptomic data. Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance. These results highlight the value and necessity of integrating spatially resolved molecular supervision for advancing multimodal learning in computational pathology. The code is included in the supplementary materials. The pretrained weights and SpaVis-6M are available at: https://github.com/Hanminghao/STAMP.

Abstract: Data-driven approaches like deep learning are rapidly advancing planetary science, particularly in Mars exploration. Despite recent progress, most existing benchmarks remain confined to closed-set supervised visual tasks and do not support text-guided retrieval for geospatial discovery. We introduce MarsRetrieval, a retrieval benchmark for evaluating vision-language models for Martian geospatial discovery. MarsRetrieval includes three tasks: (1) paired image-text retrieval, (2) landform retrieval, and (3) global geo-localization, covering multiple spatial scales and diverse geomorphic origins. We propose a unified retrieval-centric protocol to benchmark multimodal embedding architectures, including contrastive dual-tower encoders and generative vision-language models. Our evaluation shows MarsRetrieval is challenging: even strong foundation models often fail to capture domain-specific geomorphic distinctions. We further show that domain-specific fine-tuning is critical for generalizable geospatial discovery in planetary settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-stat-Sustech/MarsRetrieval

Motivation: DiT生成过程存在显著稀疏性，且稀疏性随样本变化，传统固定计算容量的加速方法效果有限。

Method: E-DiT为每个DiT块配备轻量级路由器，动态识别输入潜在的样本依赖性稀疏性，并自适应决定是否跳过块或调整MLP宽度。

Result: E-DiT在2D图像和3D资产上实现了约2倍加速，生成质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: E-DiT通过自适应加速框架显著提升了DiT的效率，同时保持了生成质量，实验证明了其在2D图像和3D资产上的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain highly computationally expensive. Previous acceleration methods, such as pruning and distillation, typically rely on a fixed computational capacity, leading to insufficient acceleration and degraded generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{Elastic Diffusion Transformer (E-DiT)}, an adaptive acceleration framework for DiT that effectively improves efficiency while maintaining generation quality. Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\sim$2$\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality. Code will be available at https://github.com/wangjiangshan0725/Elastic-DiT.

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的SpatialID框架，利用空间掩码提取器从交叉注意力响应中解耦身份注入，并结合时空调度策略动态调整空间约束。

Result: 在IBench上的实验表明，SpatialID在文本依从性（CLIP-T: 0.281）、视觉一致性（CLIP-I: 0.827）和图像质量（IQ: 0.523）方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: SpatialID通过空间自适应身份调制框架，有效解决了现有方法中身份特征污染非面部区域的问题，显著提升了文本依从性、视觉一致性和图像质量。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to integrate specific identities into arbitrary contexts. However, existing tuning-free methods typically employ Spatially Uniform Visual Injection, causing identity features to contaminate non-facial regions (e.g., backgrounds and lighting) and degrading text adherence. To address this without expensive fine-tuning, we propose SpatialID, a training-free spatially-adaptive identity modulation framework. SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.

Motivation: 解决病理基础模型（PFMs）因计算成本高而限制临床可及性和可扩展性的问题。

Method: LitePath 整合了 LiteFM（从三个大型PFMs蒸馏出的紧凑模型）和自适应补丁选择器（APS），通过减少模型参数和FLOPs，实现了在低功耗边缘硬件上的高效部署。

Result: LitePath 在37个队列和26项任务中验证，排名第二，性能优于多个大型模型，同时减少了28倍的参数和403.5倍的FLOPs，显著提升了部署效率。

Conclusion: LitePath 提供了一种快速、经济高效且节能的病理图像分析方法，在保持与最先进病理基础模型（PFMs）相当的准确性的同时，显著降低了AI部署的碳足迹。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have enabled robust generalization in computational pathology through large-scale datasets and expansive architectures, but their substantial computational cost, particularly for gigapixel whole slide images, limits clinical accessibility and scalability. Here, we present LitePath, a deployment-friendly foundational framework designed to mitigate model over-parameterization and patch level redundancy. LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将几何与运动解耦，静态场景假设或多视图重建方法依赖显式相机姿态估计或独立运动模型，Flow4R旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: Flow4R使用Vision Transformer从两视图输入预测每个像素的最小属性集（3D点位置、场景流、姿态权重和置信度），通过共享解码器对称推断局部几何和双向运动。

Result: Flow4R在4D重建和跟踪任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Flow4R通过将相机空间场景流作为核心表示，统一了3D结构、物体运动和相机运动，展示了流中心表示在时空场景理解中的有效性。

Abstract: Reconstructing and tracking dynamic 3D scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing approaches often decouple geometry from motion: multi-view reconstruction methods assume static scenes, while dynamic tracking frameworks rely on explicit camera pose estimation or separate motion models. We propose Flow4R, a unified framework that treats camera-space scene flow as the central representation linking 3D structure, object motion, and camera motion. Flow4R predicts a minimal per-pixel property set-3D point position, scene flow, pose weight, and confidence-from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer. This flow-centric formulation allows local geometry and bidirectional motion to be inferred symmetrically with a shared decoder in a single forward pass, without requiring explicit pose regressors or bundle adjustment. Trained jointly on static and dynamic datasets, Flow4R achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4D reconstruction and tracking tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flow-central representation for spatiotemporal scene understanding.

Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在生成长视频时存在严重的外推失败问题，主要源于3D位置嵌入的频谱偏差和噪声采样中缺乏动态先验。

Conclusion: FLEX作为一种即插即用的增强方法，能够无缝集成到现有推理流程中，显著提升了长视频生成的性能，支持长达4分钟的一致且动态的视频合成。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for long video generation. However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the \textit{spectral bias} of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of \textit{dynamic priors} in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{FLEX} (\textbf{F}requency-aware \textbf{L}ength \textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: BitDance是一种高效的自回归图像生成器，通过使用二进制视觉令牌和高熵二进制潜在表示，实现了紧凑且高度表达性的离散表示。其提出的二进制扩散头和next-patch扩散方法显著提升了推理速度和生成质量。

Abstract: We present BitDance, a scalable autoregressive (AR) image generator that predicts binary visual tokens instead of codebook indices. With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

TL;DR: CoCoEdit通过强化学习和区域正则化，解决了图像编辑中非目标区域内容一致性问题，并在多个基准上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在编辑目标区域时往往导致非目标区域的不必要变化，需提升内容一致性。

Method: 提出了一种基于区域正则化强化学习的后训练框架（CoCoEdit），结合像素级相似性奖励和MLLM奖励，优化编辑质量和内容一致性。

Result: 在Qwen-Image-Edit和FLUX-Kontext上应用CoCoEdit，不仅达到SOTA模型的编辑分数，还显著提升了内容一致性。

Conclusion: CoCoEdit框架通过区域正则化强化学习，在保持内容一致性的同时实现了高质量的图像编辑，显著提升了PSNR/SSIM指标和主观评分。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved impressive results with the development of large-scale generative models. However, existing models mainly focus on the editing effects of intended objects and regions, often leading to unwanted changes in unintended regions. We present a post-training framework for Content-Consistent Editing (CoCoEdit) via region regularized reinforcement learning. We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality. Applying CoCoEdit to Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, we achieve not only competitive editing scores with state-of-the-art models, but also significantly better content consistency, measured by PSNR/SSIM metrics and human subjective ratings.

TL;DR: ForgeryVCR通过视觉中心推理和战略工具学习，解决了现有MLLMs在图像伪造检测中的幻觉问题，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本中心思维链（CoT）的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像伪造检测和定位中存在幻觉问题，因为语言模态无法捕捉细粒度的像素级不一致性。

Method: 提出ForgeryVCR框架，结合法医工具箱将不可见的篡改痕迹转化为显式视觉中间体，并引入战略工具学习后训练范式，包括增益驱动的轨迹构建和监督微调（SFT），以及工具效用奖励指导的强化学习（RL）优化。

Conclusion: ForgeryVCR通过视觉中心推理和战略工具学习，显著提升了图像伪造检测和定位的性能，实现了最先进的表现。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for image forgery detection and localization predominantly operate under a text-centric Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm. However, forcing these models to textually characterize imperceptible low-level tampering traces inevitably leads to hallucinations, as linguistic modalities are insufficient to capture such fine-grained pixel-level inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward. This paradigm empowers the MLLM to act as a proactive decision-maker, learning to spontaneously invoke multi-view reasoning paths including local zoom-in for fine-grained inspection and the analysis of invisible inconsistencies in compression history, noise residuals, and frequency domains. Extensive experiments reveal that ForgeryVCR achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detection and localization tasks, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness with minimal tool redundancy.

Motivation: 现有的大规模重建模型（LRMs）在单图像3D重建中存在几何不一致和细节对齐问题，限制了重建的保真度。

Method: GeoFusionLRM利用模型自身的法线和深度预测，通过专用的transformer和融合模块反馈几何线索，以校正错误并增强与输入图像的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，GeoFusionLRM在几何锐度、法线一致性和保真度上优于现有LRM基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoFusionLRM通过几何感知的自校正框架显著提升了单图像3D重建的几何一致性和细节对齐，无需额外监督或外部信号。

Abstract: Single-image 3D reconstruction with large reconstruction models (LRMs) has advanced rapidly, yet reconstructions often exhibit geometric inconsistencies and misaligned details that limit fidelity. We introduce GeoFusionLRM, a geometry-aware self-correction framework that leverages the model's own normal and depth predictions to refine structural accuracy. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on features extracted from the input image, GeoFusionLRM feeds back geometric cues through a dedicated transformer and fusion module, enabling the model to correct errors and enforce consistency with the conditioning image. This design improves the alignment between the reconstructed mesh and the input views without additional supervision or external signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoFusionLRM achieves sharper geometry, more consistent normals, and higher fidelity than state-of-the-art LRM baselines.

Motivation: 人类感知本质上是多感官的，结合视觉、听觉和运动来理解世界。声音在空间布局、屏幕外事件和因果交互中提供了不可或缺的线索，特别是在自我中心设置中。

Method: 通过多阶段自动生成流程构建，EgoSound包含了900个视频中的7315个经过验证的问答对。

Conclusion: EgoSound为多感官自我中心智能的进步奠定了具有挑战性的基础，弥合了视觉与听觉之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding. Yet, human perception is inherently multisensory, integrating sight, sound, and motion to reason about the world. Among these modalities, sound provides indispensable cues about spatial layout, off-screen events, and causal interactions, particularly in egocentric settings where auditory and visual signals are tightly coupled. To this end, we introduce EgoSound, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate egocentric sound understanding in MLLMs. EgoSound unifies data from Ego4D and EgoBlind, encompassing both sighted and sound-dependent experiences. It defines a seven-task taxonomy spanning intrinsic sound perception, spatial localization, causal inference, and cross-modal reasoning. Constructed through a multi-stage auto-generative pipeline, EgoSound contains 7315 validated QA pairs across 900 videos. Comprehensive experiments on nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that current models exhibit emerging auditory reasoning abilities but remain limited in fine-grained spatial and causal understanding. EgoSound establishes a challenging foundation for advancing multisensory egocentric intelligence, bridging the gap between seeing and truly hearing the world.

Conclusion: DenseMLLM展示了标准、通用的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）无需架构专业化即可有效支持密集感知，具有高度竞争力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.

Abstract: Traditional mechanized chestnut harvesting is too costly for small producers, non-selective, and prone to damaging nuts. Accurate, reliable detection of chestnuts on the orchard floor is crucial for developing low-cost, vision-guided automated harvesting technology. However, developing a reliable chestnut detection system faces challenges in complex environments with shading, varying natural light conditions, and interference from weeds, fallen leaves, stones, and other foreign on-ground objects, which have remained unaddressed. This study collected 319 images of chestnuts on the orchard floor, containing 6524 annotated chestnuts. A comprehensive set of 29 state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, including 14 in the YOLO (v11-13) and 15 in the RT-DETR (v1-v4) families at varied model scales, was systematically evaluated through replicated modeling experiments for chestnut detection. Experimental results show that the YOLOv12m model achieves the best mAP@0.5 of 95.1% among all the evaluated models, while the RT-DETRv2-R101 was the most accurate variant among RT-DETR models, with mAP@0.5 of 91.1%. In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%. All models demonstrate significant potential for real-time chestnut detection, and YOLO models outperformed RT-DETR models in terms of both detection accuracy and inference, making them better suited for on-board deployment. Both the dataset and software programs in this study have been made publicly available at https://github.com/AgFood-Sensing-and-Intelligence-Lab/ChestnutDetection.

Unlike existing works that build reasoning dLLMs through task-specific reinforcement learning, LaViDa-R1 incorporates diverse multimodal understanding and generation tasks in a unified manner. In particular, LaViDa-R1 is built with a novel unified post-training framework that seamlessly integrates supervised finetuning (SFT) and multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). It employs several novel training techniques, including answer-forcing, tree search, and complementary likelihood estimation, to enhance effectiveness and scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的端口放置是机器人辅助手术中的关键步骤，端口配置既影响手术视野的视觉访问，也影响器械的可操作性。为了弥合术前计划和术中执行之间的差距，提出了ARport系统。

Method: ARport在光学透视头戴式显示器（OST-HMD）上实现，无需外部传感器或标记，简化了设置并增强了工作流程集成。它从OST-HMD捕获的RGB、深度和姿态数据重建手术场景，使用基础模型提取患者体表，并通过基于表面的无标记注册将术前解剖模型与提取的患者体表对齐，实现计划套管布局的原位可视化。

Conclusion: ARport提供了一种完全无需标记且硬件需求极低的解决方案，可直接在患者体表可视化术前套管计划。该系统有助于提高术中设置的效率，并展示了无缝融入常规临床工作流程的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Precise port placement is a critical step in robot-assisted surgery, where port configuration influences both visual access to the operative field and instrument maneuverability. To bridge the gap between preoperative planning and intraoperative execution, we present ARport, an augmented reality (AR) system that automatically maps pre-planned trocar layouts onto the patient's body surface, providing intuitive spatial guidance during surgical preparation. Methods: ARport, implemented on an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD), operates without any external sensors or markers, simplifying setup and enhancing workflow integration. It reconstructs the operative scene from RGB, depth, and pose data captured by the OST-HMD, extracts the patient's body surface using a foundation model, and performs surface-based markerless registration to align preoperative anatomical models to the extracted patient's body surface, enabling in-situ visualization of planned trocar layouts. A demonstration video illustrating the overall workflow is available online. Results: In full-scale human-phantom experiments, ARport accurately overlaid pre-planned trocar sites onto the physical phantom, achieving consistent spatial correspondence between virtual plans and real anatomy. Conclusion: ARport provides a fully marker-free and hardware-minimal solution for visualizing preoperative trocar plans directly on the patient's body surface. The system facilitates efficient intraoperative setup and demonstrates potential for seamless integration into routine clinical workflows.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖昂贵VJP计算的问题，提升文本驱动图像和视频编辑的实用性。

Method: 基于Moufad等人（2025）的理论见解，扩展了其VJP-free近似方法，并进行了大规模图像和视频编辑基准的实证评估。

Result: 测试时指导方法在性能上与基于训练的方法相当，甚至在某些情况下超越。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅通过测试时指导即可达到甚至超越基于训练的方法的性能。

Abstract: Text-driven image and video editing can be naturally cast as inpainting problems, where masked regions are reconstructed to remain consistent with both the observed content and the editing prompt. Recent advances in test-time guidance for diffusion and flow models provide a principled framework for this task; however, existing methods rely on costly vector--Jacobian product (VJP) computations to approximate the intractable guidance term, limiting their practical applicability. Building upon the recent work of Moufad et al. (2025), we provide theoretical insights into their VJP-free approximation and substantially extend their empirical evaluation to large-scale image and video editing benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that test-time guidance alone can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases surpass, training-based methods.

<details>

Motivation: 空间转录组学（ST）提供了基因表达的空间分辨测量，使得能够超越组织学评估来表征人类组织的分子景观，并提供可以与形态学对齐的局部读数。多模态基础模型的成功表明，局部表达与形态学之间的形态分子耦合可以系统地用于改善组织学表示本身。

Conclusion: SEAL提供了一个通用的框架，用于通过空间转录组学指导的微调来增强病理学基础模型，证明了通过局部分子监督增强现有模型是改善视觉表示并扩展其跨模态实用性的有效且实用的步骤。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides spatially resolved measurements of gene expression, enabling characterization of the molecular landscape of human tissue beyond histological assessment as well as localized readouts that can be aligned with morphology. Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility.

Conclusion: UniWeTok作为一种统一的离散标记器，通过大规模二进制码本和创新的训练框架，成功解决了现有视觉标记器在多目标冲突中的局限性，并在图像生成、多模态理解和编辑等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的编辑方法在多条件一致性上表现不佳，缺乏参考输入间的有效交互。

Method: 提出了Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF)作为统一的输入表示方法，采用两阶段训练框架（SFT和RL），并引入Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO)优化模型。

Conclusion: UniRef-Image-Edit通过SELF和MSGRPO等技术，实现了单图像编辑和多图像合成的统一框架，并在开源社区中共享资源以促进研究。

Abstract: We present UniRef-Image-Edit, a high-performance multi-modal generation system that unifies single-image editing and multi-image composition within a single framework. Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes.

Conclusion: GeoEyes框架通过分阶段训练和强化学习方法，显著提升了超高分辨率遥感视觉问答任务中的准确性和证据获取能力，实现了54.23%的XLRS-Bench准确率。

Abstract: The "thinking-with-images" paradigm enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to actively explore visual scenes via zoom-in tools. This is essential for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing VQA, where task-relevant cues are sparse and tiny. However, we observe a consistent failure mode in existing zoom-enabled MLLMs: Tool Usage Homogenization, where tool calls collapse into task-agnostic patterns, limiting effective evidence acquisition. To address this, we propose GeoEyes, a staged training framework consisting of (1) a cold-start SFT dataset, UHR Chain-of-Zoom (UHR-CoZ), which covers diverse zooming regimes, and (2) an agentic reinforcement learning method, AdaZoom-GRPO, that explicitly rewards evidence gain and answer improvement during zoom interactions. The resulting model learns on-demand zooming with proper stopping behavior and achieves substantial improvements on UHR remote sensing benchmarks, with 54.23% accuracy on XLRS-Bench.

TL;DR: HiVid利用LLM作为人类代理，通过三个创新模块解决了视频流媒体中重要性权重生成的挑战，显著提升了预测准确率和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接人工标注视频重要性权重成本过高，而视觉显著性模型泛化能力差，因此需要一种可扩展且高保真的方法生成权重。

Method: HiVid框架包含三个关键模块：(1) 感知模块，通过局部上下文窗口评估帧并自回归构建视频连贯理解；(2) 排名模块，采用LLM引导的归并排序算法进行全局重排；(3) 预测模块，通过多模态时间序列模型预测未来权重。

Result: 实验表明，HiVid在VOD和直播流中的权重预测准确率分别提升了11.5%和26%，真实用户研究验证其QoE相关性提升了14.7%。

Conclusion: HiVid框架通过结合LLM和创新的模块设计，显著提升了视频流媒体中重要性权重预测的准确性，进而优化了用户体验质量(QoE)。

Abstract: Content-aware streaming requires dynamic, chunk-level importance weights to optimize subjective quality of experience (QoE). However, direct human annotation is prohibitively expensive while vision-saliency models generalize poorly. We introduce HiVid, the first framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as a scalable human proxy to generate high-fidelity weights for both Video-on-Demand (VOD) and live streaming. We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\% for VOD and 26\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\%.

TL;DR: Freq-DP Net利用双像素传感器和双分支网络，融合几何与结构先验，显著提升单图像栅栏去除效果，实验验证其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像中的栅栏遮挡不仅降低视觉质量，还限制了下游计算机视觉应用。现有方法在静态场景中表现不佳或需多帧运动线索，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: Freq-DP Net是一个双分支网络，结合了由散焦视差建模的几何先验和通过快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）学习的栅栏全局模式结构先验，并通过注意力机制智能融合这些线索。

Result: 实验表明，Freq-DP Net在多样化的栅栏基准测试中显著优于通用基线方法，确立了单图像DP栅栏去除的新标杆。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于双像素（DP）传感器的创新框架Freq-DP Net，通过融合几何先验和结构先验，显著提升了单图像栅栏去除的准确性，并在实验中验证了其优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Removing fence occlusions from single images is a challenging task that degrades visual quality and limits downstream computer vision applications. Existing methods often fail on static scenes or require motion cues from multiple frames. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first framework to leverage dual-pixel (DP) sensors for this problem. We propose Freq-DP Net, a novel dual-branch network that fuses two complementary priors: a geometric prior from defocus disparity, modeled using an explicit cost volume, and a structural prior of the fence's global pattern, learned via Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). An attention mechanism intelligently merges these cues for highly accurate fence segmentation. To validate our approach, we build and release a diverse benchmark with different fence varieties. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong general-purpose baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art for single-image, DP-based fence removal.

Motivation: 现有基准数据集主要捕捉几何信息而忽略拓扑结构，限制了3D形状分析的全面性。

Method: 提出了TopoGAT方法，直接从输入数据和拓扑特征中学习选择最具信息量的拓扑特征，避免了手工统计选择标准的局限性。

Result: TopoGAT在稳定性和判别力上优于传统统计方法，集成到标准流程后提升了分类和分割性能。

Conclusion: 通过提出的TopoGAT方法和拓扑增强数据集，成功将持久同调特征融入深度学习流程，提升了3D点云分析的分类和分割性能。

Abstract: Geometry and topology constitute complementary descriptors of three-dimensional shape, yet existing benchmark datasets primarily capture geometric information while neglecting topological structure. This work addresses this limitation by introducing topologically-enriched versions of ModelNet40 and ShapeNet, where each point cloud is augmented with its corresponding persistent homology features. These benchmarks with the topological signatures establish a foundation for unified geometry-topology learning and enable systematic evaluation of topology-aware deep learning architectures for 3D shape analysis. Building on this foundation, we propose a deep learning-based significant persistent point selection method, \textit{TopoGAT}, that learns to identify the most informative topological features directly from input data and the corresponding topological signatures, circumventing the limitations of hand-crafted statistical selection criteria. A comparative study verifies the superiority of the proposed method over traditional statistical approaches in terms of stability and discriminative power. Integrating the selected significant persistent points into standard point cloud classification and part-segmentation pipelines yields improvements in both classification accuracy and segmentation metrics. The presented topologically-enriched datasets, coupled with our learnable significant feature selection approach, enable the broader integration of persistent homology into the practical deep learning workflows for 3D point cloud analysis.

Motivation: 现有解决方案在处理长视频时存在计算浪费问题，亟需一种更高效的内存管理方法。

Method: Sali-Cache 结合了基于光流分析的时间滤波器和基于显著性检测的空间滤波器，进行智能内存管理。

Result: 在 LLaVA 1.6 架构上，Sali-Cache 实现了 2.20 倍的内存压缩比，同时保持 100% 的准确性。

Conclusion: Sali-Cache 通过先验优化框架有效解决了 VLMs 处理长视频时的内存瓶颈问题，实现了高效的内存压缩和性能保持。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the usability gap in instruction-based object addition caused by ambiguous text prompts or tedious mask inputs.

Method: The framework uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement and a diffusion model for joint object and mask generation.

Result: The placement model significantly outperforms random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, with a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools by validating the decoupled approach and demonstrating high-fidelity edits.

Abstract: Instruction-based object addition is often hindered by the ambiguity of text-only prompts or the tedious nature of mask-based inputs. To address this usability gap, we introduce AbracADDbra, a user-friendly framework that leverages intuitive touch priors to spatially ground succinct instructions for precise placement. Our efficient, decoupled architecture uses a vision-language transformer for touch-guided placement, followed by a diffusion model that jointly generates the object and an instance mask for high-fidelity blending. To facilitate standardized evaluation, we contribute the Touch2Add benchmark for this interactive task. Our extensive evaluations, where our placement model significantly outperforms both random placement and general-purpose VLM baselines, confirm the framework's ability to produce high-fidelity edits. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between initial placement accuracy and final edit quality, validating our decoupled approach. This work thus paves the way for more accessible and efficient creative tools.

TL;DR: ScreenParse是一个大规模屏幕解析数据集，训练出的ScreenVLM模型在性能上显著优于大型基础VLM，并展示了强迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集提供的稀疏监督限制了覆盖范围和泛化能力，且实际部署需要低延迟的本地使用效率。

Method: 通过Webshot自动化管道生成ScreenParse数据集，并训练一个紧凑的316M参数视觉语言模型ScreenVLM，采用结构感知损失解码ScreenTag标记表示。

Result: ScreenVLM在密集解析任务上大幅优于更大的基础VLM（如PageIoU 0.592 vs. 0.294），并在公共基准测试中表现出强迁移能力。

Conclusion: ScreenParse数据集和ScreenVLM模型显著提升了屏幕解析的性能，并在公共基准测试中表现出强迁移能力，证明了密集屏幕监督对UI理解的可转移结构先验价值。

Abstract: Modern computer-use agents (CUA) must perceive a screen as a structured state, what elements are visible, where they are, and what text they contain, before they can reliably ground instructions and act. Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中两帧相对位姿优化问题，探索结合光度误差和重投影误差优点的第三种方法。

Method: 使用密集采样的几何特征描述符，将光度误差替换为来自密集描述符集的描述符残差，从而在差分光度方法中实现亚像素精度，同时利用几何特征描述符的表达能力。

Conclusion: 尽管提出的策略是一种有趣的方法，能实现精确跟踪，但最终未能超越基于重投影误差的位姿优化策略。作者分析了这种差异的潜在原因，并提出假设：描述符相似性度量变化过慢，且不一定严格对应关键点放置的准确性。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in computer vision is the two-frame relative pose optimization problem. Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy.

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症之一，早期检测对有效治疗至关重要。然而，当前的AI诊断工具通常基于以浅色皮肤为主的数据集训练，导致对深色皮肤人群的准确性和公平性降低。ISIC数据集中超过70%为浅色皮肤图像，深色皮肤图像不足8%，这种不平衡对公平医疗构成了重大障碍。

Result: 在病变分割任务中，使用增强数据集训练的模型在IoU、Dice系数和边界准确性上表现出一致的提升。在分类任务中，使用增强数据集训练的EfficientNet-B0模型达到了92.14%的准确率。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过生成式AI整合的合成数据增强可以显著减少传统皮肤科诊断中的偏见，提高公平性，并为未来研究方向开辟了挑战。

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and early detection is critical for effective treatment. However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions.

Motivation: 早期诊断和紧密随访对RA管理至关重要，但患者通常需要较长时间才能获得专科护理，因此需要开发基于RGB图像的简易关节炎症检测系统。

Method: 构建了一个专用的数据集，并提出了一个炎症检测框架，该框架结合了自监督预训练和大规模健康手部图像的不平衡感知训练。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的全局局部编码器框架结合自监督预训练和不平衡感知训练，显著提升了从RGB手部图像中检测类风湿性关节炎（RA）相关关节炎症的性能。

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic joint inflammation. Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model.

Motivation: 传统基于图像的方法在高动态场景中受限，需要高速摄像机且存储和计算成本高昂。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一个事件-帧融合框架，利用事件流提供时间密集的运动线索，帧数据提供空间密集的精确估计。采用AIS框架将变形场划分为线性化的子区域，并通过邻域贪婪优化策略加速参数搜索和减少误差积累。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在生存率上优于现有基线1.6%，且仅需高速视频方法18.9%的存储和处理资源。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的AIS框架通过结合事件流和帧数据，有效解决了高动态场景下的密集变形测量问题，显著降低了存储和计算资源需求。

Abstract: Visual Deformation Measurement (VDM) aims to recover dense deformation fields by tracking surface motion from camera observations. Traditional image-based methods rely on minimal inter-frame motion to constrain the correspondence search space, which limits their applicability to highly dynamic scenes or necessitates high-speed cameras at the cost of prohibitive storage and computational overhead. We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by 1.6% in survival rate. Remarkably, it achieves this using only 18.9% of the data storage and processing resources of high-speed video methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在流式管道中实现实时自回归视频生成，需要解决VACE双向注意力与固定块大小及因果注意力的不兼容问题。

Method: 通过将参考帧从扩散潜在空间移至并行条件路径，实现了固定块大小和KV缓存的保留，无需额外训练即可复用预训练VACE权重。

Result: 在1.3B和14B模型规模下，VACE增加了20-30%的延迟开销，但对参考视频的保真度因因果注意力限制而显著下降。

Conclusion: VACE的实时自回归视频生成适配在保持固定块大小和KV缓存的同时，成功复用了预训练权重，但因果注意力限制导致参考视频保真度显著下降。

Abstract: We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/daydreamlive/scope.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对纯文本大型语言模型（LLMs）的多轮越狱攻击在扩展到大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）时效果不佳，因为过度恶意的视觉输入容易触发安全对齐的防御机制。

Method: MAPA采用两级设计：1）每轮交替文本和视觉攻击动作以引发最恶意的响应；2）通过迭代的来回调整逐步放大响应的恶意程度。

Result: MAPA在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，攻击成功率提高了11-35%。

Conclusion: MAPA作为一种多轮自适应提示攻击方法，通过交替文本和视觉攻击动作，并在多轮中调整攻击轨迹，显著提高了对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的攻击成功率。

Abstract: Multi-turn jailbreak attacks are effective against text-only large language models (LLMs) by gradually introducing malicious content across turns. When extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), we find that naively adding visual inputs can cause existing multi-turn jailbreaks to be easily defended. For example, overly malicious visual input will easily trigger the defense mechanism of safety-aligned LVLMs, making the response more conservative. To address this, we propose MAPA: a multi-turn adaptive prompting attack that 1) at each turn, alternates text-vision attack actions to elicit the most malicious response; and 2) across turns, adjusts the attack trajectory through iterative back-and-forth refinement to gradually amplify response maliciousness. This two-level design enables MAPA to consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, improving attack success rates by 11-35% on recent benchmarks against LLaVA-V1.6-Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: pFedNavi是一个针对视觉语言导航的个性化联邦学习框架，通过自适应层选择和细粒度参数融合，显著提升了导航性能和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉语言导航（VLN）需要大规模轨迹指令数据，而这些数据通常来自私有室内环境，存在隐私问题。联邦学习（FL）虽然可以保持数据在设备上，但在VLN的极端跨客户端异构性（环境和指令风格）下表现不佳。

Method: pFedNavi采用层间混合系数自适应识别客户端特定层，并在选定的组件（如编码器-解码器投影和环境敏感解码器层）上进行细粒度参数融合，以平衡全局知识共享与本地专业化。

Result: 在R2R和RxR两个标准VLN基准测试中，pFedNavi在所有指标上均优于基于FedAvg的VLN基线，导航成功率提高了7.5%，轨迹保真度提高了7.8%，且在非IID条件下收敛速度提高了1.38倍。

Conclusion: pFedNavi通过结构感知和动态自适应的个性化联邦学习框架，显著提升了视觉语言导航（VLN）的性能，特别是在非独立同分布（non-IID）条件下的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation VLN requires large-scale trajectory instruction data from private indoor environments, raising significant privacy concerns. Federated Learning FL mitigates this by keeping data on-device, but vanilla FL struggles under VLNs' extreme cross-client heterogeneity in environments and instruction styles, making a single global model suboptimal. This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal methods are widely used in rice deterioration detection, which exhibit limited capability in representing and extracting fine-grained abnormal features. Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry.

Result: 实验发现：(1) 学习姿态提案单独使用不可靠；(2) 未与相机内参对齐的几何提案会降低性能；(3) 几何对齐后的深度提案结合几何后端可提升性能。

Conclusion: 几何模块不仅是学习组件的细化部分，更是验证和吸收学习几何观察的关键仲裁者。研究强调了模块化、几何感知系统设计对鲁棒空间感知的重要性。

Abstract: Spatial perception aims to estimate camera motion and scene structure from visual observations, a problem traditionally addressed through geometric modeling and physical consistency constraints. Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.
  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.
  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations. Our study highlights the importance of modular, geometry-aware system design for robust spatial perception.

TL;DR: HiVA是一种分层视觉-语言交互方法，通过结合文本AU描述和视觉特征，提升了AU检测的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部动作单元（AU）检测在有限标注数据条件下，需要学习具有区分性和泛化能力的AU表示。HiVA旨在利用文本AU描述作为语义先验，增强AU检测。

Method: HiVA采用了一种分层视觉-语言交互方法，包括AU感知动态图模块、解耦双交叉注意力（DDCA）和上下文双交叉注意力（CDCA）机制，以捕获细粒度和整体的视觉-语言关联。

Result: 实验表明，HiVA在性能上 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches，并生成语义有意义的激活模式。

Conclusion: HiVA方法通过结合视觉和语言模态的多粒度特征，显著提升了面部动作单元（AU）检测的性能，并展示了其在学习鲁棒且可解释的跨模态对应关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: Facial Action Unit (AU) detection seeks to recognize subtle facial muscle activations as defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态虚假信息结合逼真的图像编辑和误导性文本，现有单一证据源的检测系统难以应对。

Method: D-SECURE整合了HAMMER篡改检测器和DEFAME检索流程，前者分析细微篡改，后者进行广泛验证，两者互补。

Result: 在DGM4和ClaimReview样本上的实验验证了D-SECURE的有效性，展示了两种系统的互补优势。

Conclusion: D-SECURE框架通过结合内部篡改检测和外部证据推理，有效提升了多模态虚假信息的检测能力，为新闻类帖子提供了统一的、可解释的报告。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation increasingly mixes realistic im-age edits with fluent but misleading text, producing persuasive posts that are difficult to verify. Existing systems usually rely on a single evidence source. Content-based detectors identify local inconsistencies within an image and its caption but cannot determine global factual truth. Retrieval-based fact-checkers reason over external evidence but treat inputs as coarse claims and often miss subtle visual or textual manipulations. This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion. We provide a unified, explainable report that incorporates manipulation cues and external evidence.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have achieved remarkable visual quality, while a fundamental challenge remains: Can image generation be controlled at the element level, enabling intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, altering colors, or adding and removing objects? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

Conclusion: CoCoDiff是一种无需额外训练或监督的先进风格迁移框架，通过利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和创新的像素级语义对应模块，实现了细粒度且语义一致的风格化，在视觉质量和定量结果上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Transferring visual style between images while preserving semantic correspondence between similar objects remains a central challenge in computer vision. While existing methods have made great strides, most of them operate at global level but overlook region-wise and even pixel-wise semantic correspondence. To address this, we propose CoCoDiff, a novel training-free and low-cost style transfer framework that leverages pretrained latent diffusion models to achieve fine-grained, semantically consistent stylization. We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理中因全局图像编码丢失微小物体、杂乱区域或细微标记等关键证据的问题。

Method: TikArt采用Think-Aperture-Observe循环，交替进行语言生成和两种孔径动作（Zoom和Segment），并通过AGRPO算法优化推理策略。

Result: 在V*、HR-Bench-4K/8K、MME-RealWorld-Lite、MMStar、RefCOCO和ReasonSeg等基准测试中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TikArt通过多步视觉语言推理在细粒度视觉任务中表现出色，结合GRPO风格的强化学习算法优化了推理策略，并在多个基准测试中取得了显著提升。

Abstract: We address fine-grained visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where key evidence may reside in tiny objects, cluttered regions, or subtle markings that are lost under a single global image encoding. We introduce TikArt (Thinking Aperture), an aperture-guided agent that casts multi-step vision-language reasoning as a decision process over regions of interest. TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory. Built on Qwen3-VL-8B, TikArt optimizes its reasoning policy with AGRPO, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning algorithm with a two-stage curriculum: it warms up segmentation actions and then jointly optimizes visual math, fine-grained VQA, and segmentation, using rewards that couple task success with purposeful aperture use. Experiments on V*, HR-Bench-4K/8K, MME-RealWorld-Lite, MMStar, RefCOCO, and ReasonSeg show consistent gains over the backbone and yield interpretable aperture trajectories for high-resolution reasoning.

Conclusion: 该论文强调了在视觉-语言医学分割任务中融入不确定性建模和结构化模态对齐的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware multimodal segmentation framework that leverages both radiological images and associated clinical text for precise medical diagnosis. We propose a Modality Decoding Attention Block (MoDAB) with a lightweight State Space Mixer (SSMix) to enable efficient cross-modal fusion and long-range dependency modelling. To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty modelling and structured modality alignment in vision-language medical segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 解决全切片图像中非肿瘤实例过多导致的实例纠缠问题，以及肿瘤与癌前组织高度相似导致的语义纠缠问题。

Method: 提出了PID-LRSC框架，结合低秩正则子空间聚类（LRSC）和原型实例语义解耦（PID），通过次级实例子空间学习和增强对比学习解决实例和语义纠缠问题。

Result: 在多中心病理数据集上的实验表明，PID-LRSC优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: PID-LRSC通过清晰的实例语义和增强的辅助诊断可靠性，显著提升了病理诊断的效果。

Abstract: The tumor region plays a key role in pathological diagnosis. Tumor tissues are highly similar to precancerous lesions and non tumor instances often greatly exceed tumor instances in whole slide images (WSIs). These issues cause instance-semantic entanglement in multi-instance learning frameworks, degrading both model representation capability and interpretability. To address this, we propose an end-to-end prototype instance semantic disentanglement framework with low-rank regularized subspace clustering, PID-LRSC, in two aspects. First, we use secondary instance subspace learning to construct low-rank regularized subspace clustering (LRSC), addressing instance entanglement caused by an excessive proportion of non tumor instances. Second, we employ enhanced contrastive learning to design prototype instance semantic disentanglement (PID), resolving semantic entanglement caused by the high similarity between tumor and precancerous tissues. We conduct extensive experiments on multicentre pathology datasets, implying that PID-LRSC outperforms other SOTA methods. Overall, PID-LRSC provides clearer instance semantics during decision-making and significantly enhances the reliability of auxiliary diagnostic outcomes.

Conclusion: 提出的端到端MIL框架结合Grassmann重新嵌入和流形自适应聚类，在分级准确性和可解释性方面表现优异，且计算资源需求可接受。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are the gold standard for pathological diagnosis and sub-typing. Current main-stream two-step frameworks employ offline feature encoders trained without domain-specific knowledge. Among them, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods are outcome-oriented and offer limited interpretability. Clustering-based approaches can provide explainable decision-making process but suffer from high dimension features and semantically ambiguous centroids. To this end, we propose an end-to-end MIL framework that integrates Grassmann re-embedding and manifold adaptive clustering, where the manifold geometric structure facilitates robust clustering results. Furthermore, we design a prior knowledge guiding proxy instance labeling and aggregation strategy to approximate patch labels and focus on pathologically relevant tumor regions. Experiments on multicentre WSI datasets demonstrate that: 1) our cluster-incorporated model achieves superior performance in both grading accuracy and interpretability; 2) end-to-end learning refines better feature representations and it requires acceptable computation resources.

Abstract: Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.

Motivation: 解决现有结构保持方法效率低下、参数冗余且无法同时优化文本提示与结构输入的问题。

Method: 提出两种高效适配器（Nexus Prime和Slim），利用交叉注意力机制实现多模态条件输入，使适配器能同时理解文本提示和结构输入。

Conclusion: Nexus Adapters（Nexus Prime和Slim）通过结合文本提示和结构输入，显著提升了结构保持条件生成的效率与性能，同时大幅减少了参数数量。

Abstract: We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 优化器的选择和低学习率对模型性能的影响比架构选择更为关键，ConvNeXt-Base在优化设置下表现出色，具有强跨事件泛化能力。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate building damage assessment in the immediate aftermath of tornadoes is critical for coordinating life-saving search and rescue operations, optimizing emergency resource allocation, and accelerating community recovery. However, current automated methods struggle with the unique visual complexity of tornado-induced wreckage, primarily due to severe domain shift from standard pre-training datasets and extreme class imbalance in real-world disaster data. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic experimental framework evaluating 79 open-source deep learning models, encompassing both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, across over 2,300 controlled experiments on our newly curated Quad-State Tornado Damage (QSTD) benchmark dataset. Our findings reveal that achieving operational-grade performance hinges on a complex interaction between architecture and optimization, rather than architectural selection alone. Most strikingly, we demonstrate that optimizer choice can be more consequential than architecture: switching from Adam to SGD provided dramatic F1 gains of +25 to +38 points for Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer families, fundamentally reversing their ranking from bottom-tier to competitive with top-performing CNNs. Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures. Our champion model, ConvNeXt-Base trained with these optimized settings, demonstrated strong cross-event generalization on the held-out Tuscaloosa-Moore Tornado Damage (TMTD) dataset, achieving 46.4% Macro F1 (+34.6 points over baseline) and retaining 85.5% Ordinal Top-1 Accuracy despite temporal and sensor domain shifts.

Method: 比较了专用的OCR transformer（TrOCR）和通用视觉语言模型（Qwen）在线级历史英文文本上的表现，使用了长度加权准确性指标和假设驱动的错误分析。

Result: Qwen实现了较低的CER/WER和对退化输入的更强鲁棒性，但表现出选择性语言正则化和拼写规范化，可能无声地改变历史上有意义的形式；TrOCR更一致地保持了拼写保真度，但更容易出现级联错误传播。

Conclusion: 架构的归纳偏差以系统化的方式塑造了OCR错误结构，具有相似总体准确性的模型在错误局部性、可检测性和下游学术风险方面可能存在显著差异，强调了在历史数字化工作流程中进行架构感知评估的必要性。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of eighteenth-century printed texts remains challenging due to degraded print quality, archaic glyphs, and non-standardized orthography. Although transformer-based OCR systems and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong aggregate accuracy, metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) provide limited insight into their reliability for scholarly use. We compare a dedicated OCR transformer (TrOCR) and a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (Qwen) on line-level historical English texts using length-weighted accuracy metrics and hypothesis driven error analysis.
  While Qwen achieves lower CER/WER and greater robustness to degraded input, it exhibits selective linguistic regularization and orthographic normalization that may silently alter historically meaningful forms. TrOCR preserves orthographic fidelity more consistently but is more prone to cascading error propagation. Our findings show that architectural inductive biases shape OCR error structure in systematic ways. Models with similar aggregate accuracy can differ substantially in error locality, detectability, and downstream scholarly risk, underscoring the need for architecture-aware evaluation in historical digitization workflows.

Conclusion: CVGC框架通过跨视角几何一致性模块显著提升了LiDAR语义分割在跨视角场景中的泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Domain-generalized LiDAR semantic segmentation (LSS) seeks to train models on source-domain point clouds that generalize reliably to multiple unseen target domains, which is essential for real-world LiDAR applications. However, existing approaches assume similar acquisition views (e.g., vehicle-mounted) and struggle in cross-view scenarios, where observations differ substantially due to viewpoint-dependent structural incompleteness and non-uniform point density. Accordingly, we formulate cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation and propose a novel framework, termed CVGC (Cross-View Geometric Consistency). Specifically, we introduce a cross-view geometric augmentation module that models viewpoint-induced variations in visibility and sampling density, generating multiple cross-view observations of the same scene. Subsequently, a geometric consistency module enforces consistent semantic and occupancy predictions across geometrically augmented point clouds of the same scene. Extensive experiments on six public LiDAR datasets establish the first systematic evaluation of cross-view domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation, demonstrating that CVGC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods when generalizing from a single source domain to multiple target domains with heterogeneous acquisition viewpoints.

Our task-specific reward design combines semantic alignment and reasoning coherence for understanding with physical plausibility and text-motion consistency for generation, improving both logical reasoning and perceptual realism. To further enhance inference, we introduce Chain-of-Motion (CoM), a test-time reasoning method that enables step-by-step planning and reflection. We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) concerns the synthesis of realistic person imagery through garment re-rendering under human pose and body constraints. In practice, however, existing approaches are typically optimized for specific data conditions, making their deployment reliant on retraining and limiting their generalization as a unified solution. We present OmniVTON++, a training-free VTON framework designed for universal applicability. It addresses the intertwined challenges of garment alignment, human structural coherence, and boundary continuity by coordinating Structured Garment Morphing for correspondence-driven garment adaptation, Principal Pose Guidance for step-wise structural regulation during diffusion sampling, and Continuous Boundary Stitching for boundary-aware refinement, forming a cohesive pipeline without task-specific retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse generalization settings, including cross-dataset and cross-garment-type evaluations, while reliably operating across scenarios and diffusion backbones within a single formulation. In addition to single-garment, single-human cases, the framework supports multi-garment, multi-human, and anime character virtual try-on, expanding the scope of virtual try-on applications. The source code will be released to the public.

Conclusion: DriveFine结合了扩散模型和令牌模型的优势，通过block-MoE设计实现了灵活的生成与自校正能力，并在多个基准测试中展现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving increasingly adopt generative planners trained with imitation learning followed by reinforcement learning. Diffusion-based planners suffer from modality alignment difficulties, low training efficiency, and limited generalization. Token-based planners are plagued by cumulative causal errors and irreversible decoding. In summary, the two dominant paradigms exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we propose DriveFine, a masked diffusion VLA model that combines flexible decoding with self-correction capabilities. In particular, we design a novel plug-and-play block-MoE, which seamlessly injects a refinement expert on top of the generation expert. By enabling explicit expert selection during inference and gradient blocking during training, the two experts are fully decoupled, preserving the foundational capabilities and generic patterns of the pretrained weights, which highlights the flexibility and extensibility of the block-MoE design. Furthermore, we design a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that encourages effective exploration of refinement expert while maintaining training stability. Extensive experiments on NAVSIM v1, v2, and Navhard benchmarks demonstrate that DriveFine exhibits strong efficacy and robustness. The code will be released at https://github.com/MSunDYY/DriveFine.

Abstract: You Only Look Once (YOLO) has been the prominent model for computer vision in deep learning for a decade. This study explores the novel aspects of YOLO26, the most recent version in the YOLO series. The elimination of Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), implementation of End-to-End NMS-Free Inference, introduction of ProgLoss + Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and use of the MuSGD optimizer are the primary enhancements designed to improve inference speed, which is claimed to achieve a 43% boost in CPU mode. This is designed to allow YOLO26 to attain real-time performance on edge devices or those without GPUs. Additionally, YOLO26 offers improvements in many computer vision tasks, including instance segmentation, pose estimation, and oriented bounding box (OBB) decoding. We aim for this effort to provide more value than just consolidating information already included in the existing technical documentation. Therefore, we performed a rigorous architectural investigation into YOLO26, mostly using the source code available in its GitHub repository and its official documentation. The authentic and detailed operational mechanisms of YOLO26 are inside the source code, which is seldom extracted by others. The YOLO26 architectural diagram is shown as the outcome of the investigation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first one presenting the CNN-based YOLO26 architecture, which is the core of YOLO26. Our objective is to provide a precise architectural comprehension of YOLO26 for researchers and developers aspiring to enhance the YOLO model, ensuring it remains the leading deep learning model in computer vision.

Motivation: 传统ViT在处理医学图像时，由于固定尺寸patch的限制，可能导致信息丢失或伪影，影响诊断。VariViT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VariViT通过新颖的位置嵌入调整方案和新的批处理策略，处理可变数量的patch，同时降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: VariViT在图像表示学习中表现出色，特别是在处理可变尺寸图像时，通过保持一致的patch大小和优化计算策略，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture in representation learning, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to excel in various tasks. ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

Conclusion: VIGIL填补了多模态评估领域的空白，通过细粒度分类和分解幻觉问题，为大型多模态模型（LMMs）提供了更深入的理解和解释。

Abstract: We introduce VIGIL (Visual Inconsistency & Generative In-context Lucidity), the first benchmark dataset and framework providing a fine-grained categorization of hallucinations in the multimodal image recontextualization task for large multimodal models (LMMs). While existing research often treats hallucinations as a uniform issue, our work addresses a significant gap in multimodal evaluation by decomposing these errors into five categories: pasted object hallucinations, background hallucinations, object omission, positional & logical inconsistencies, and physical law violations. To address these complexities, we propose a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our architecture processes recontextualized images through a series of specialized steps targeting object-level fidelity, background consistency, and omission detection, leveraging a coordinated ensemble of open-source models, whose effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations. Our approach enables a deeper understanding of where the models fail with an explanation; thus, we fill a gap in the field, as no prior methods offer such categorization and decomposition for this task. To promote transparency and further exploration, we openly release VIGIL, along with the detection pipeline and benchmark code, through our GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlubneuskaya/vigil and Data repository: https://huggingface.co/datasets/joannaww/VIGIL.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于调制的方法在自由手绘草图输入中实现了更好的语义对齐，同时生成的图像在真实感和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in generative AI, with natural language emerging as the most common conditioning input. As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled powerful image editing capabilities guided by natural language prompts, unlocking new creative possibilities. However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models.

Motivation: 探索长期运动信息在视觉学习中的属性和作用，以弥补时间维度在感知研究中的不足。

Method: 利用点轨迹估计技术学习时间表示，并在多种感知任务中进行实验。

Result: 1) 长期运动信息能更好地理解动作、物体、材料和空间信息；2) 在低数据和零样本任务中泛化能力更强；3) 运动信息在计算效率和准确性之间提供了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 长期运动信息在感知任务中具有重要作用，能够提升对动作、物体、材料和空间信息的理解，且在低数据和零样本任务中表现优于图像信息。

Abstract: Temporal information has long been considered to be essential for perception. While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception.

Motivation: 现有方法通常训练任务特定的编码器来处理辅助输入，容易过拟合并泛化能力差。CAPA旨在通过冻结FM主干并仅优化少量参数，更高效地利用基础模型的几何先验。

Method: CAPA采用参数高效微调（如LoRA或VPT）方法，仅更新少量参数，并通过稀疏观测的梯度直接指导优化。对于视频数据，CAPA引入了序列级参数共享，联合调整所有帧以利用时间相关性。

Result: CAPA在多样化的条件模式下，在室内和室外数据集上均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAPA通过冻结预训练的3D基础模型（FM）主干，仅更新最小参数集，利用稀疏几何线索进行测试时优化，显著提升了深度补全任务的性能，并在室内外数据集上达到了最先进的结果。

Abstract: We introduce CAPA, a parameter-efficient test-time optimization framework that adapts pre-trained 3D foundation models (FMs) for depth completion, using sparse geometric cues. Unlike prior methods that train task-specific encoders for auxiliary inputs, which often overfit and generalize poorly, CAPA freezes the FM backbone. Instead, it updates only a minimal set of parameters using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (e.g. LoRA or VPT), guided by gradients calculated directly from the sparse observations available at inference time. This approach effectively grounds the foundation model's geometric prior in the scene-specific measurements, correcting distortions and misplaced structures. For videos, CAPA introduces sequence-level parameter sharing, jointly adapting all frames to exploit temporal correlations, improve robustness, and enforce multi-frame consistency. CAPA is model-agnostic, compatible with any ViT-based FM, and achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse condition patterns on both indoor and outdoor datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临重复训练、高计算成本和遗忘问题，限制了其实际应用。SAILS旨在通过免训练框架解决这些挑战。

Method: SAILS利用基础模型将CISS解耦为两个阶段：使用SAM进行零样本区域提取，随后在固定特征空间中通过原型进行语义关联，并结合选择性类内聚类以更好地建模类内变异性。

Result: SAILS在标准CISS数据集上，尤其在长且挑战性的任务序列中，通常超越现有基于训练的方法，且完全消除了遗忘问题。

Conclusion: SAILS框架通过避免参数更新，彻底消除了遗忘问题，并保持了任务不变的性能表现，同时展现出正向的后向迁移能力。

Abstract: Continual learning remains constrained by the need for repeated retraining, high computational costs, and the persistent challenge of forgetting. These factors significantly limit the applicability of continuous learning in real-world settings, as iterative model updates require significant computational resources and inherently exacerbate forgetting. We present SAILS -- Segment Anything with Incrementally Learned Semantics, a training-free framework for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) that sidesteps these challenges entirely. SAILS leverages foundational models to decouple CISS into two stages: Zero-shot region extraction using Segment Anything Model (SAM), followed by semantic association through prototypes in a fixed feature space. SAILS incorporates selective intra-class clustering, resulting in multiple prototypes per class to better model intra-class variability. Our results demonstrate that, despite requiring no incremental training, SAILS typically surpasses the performance of existing training-based approaches on standard CISS datasets, particularly in long and challenging task sequences where forgetting tends to be most severe. By avoiding parameter updates, SAILS completely eliminates forgetting and maintains consistent, task-invariant performance. Furthermore, SAILS exhibits positive backward transfer, where the introduction of new classes can enhance performance on previous classes.

Conclusion: GOT-JEPA和OccuSolver通过模型预测预训练框架和精细遮挡感知机制，显著提升了跟踪器的泛化能力和鲁棒性，在七个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: The human visual system tracks objects by integrating current observations with previously observed information, adapting to target and scene changes, and reasoning about occlusion at fine granularity. In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: VIPA框架在四个公开的RIS基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有视线路径度量标准容易受到数据集中心偏差的干扰，导致难以区分真正的行为对齐和中心倾向。

Method: 通过使用Gaze-CIFAR-10数据集，分析了硬注意力分类器在不同感知约束下的表现，并提出了GCS这一中心偏差校正的复合度量标准。

Result: 研究发现，仅在特定的感知约束范围内，视线路径既能在去偏后超过中心基线，又能在运动统计上保持人类相似性。GCS揭示了中等补丁大小下的感知优势区域。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的度量标准GCS（Gaze Consistency Score），用于解决中心偏差问题，并揭示了在中等补丁大小下的感知优势区域，为评估主动感知和设计视线基准提供了新视角。

Abstract: Human eye movements in visual recognition reflect a balance between foveal sampling and peripheral context. Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a "shortcut regime" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias.

Conclusion: 本文通过提出STAformer和STAformer++两种新型注意力架构，以及引入环境可供性和交互热点模块，显著提升了短期目标交互预测的性能，并在Ego4D和EPIC-Kitchens数据集上取得了显著的改进。

Abstract: Short Term object-interaction Anticipation consists in detecting the location of the next active objects, the noun and verb categories of the interaction, as well as the time to contact from the observation of egocentric video. This ability is fundamental for wearable assistants to understand user goals and provide timely assistance, or to enable human-robot interaction. In this work, we present a method to improve the performance of STA predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels. We released the code, annotations, and pre-extracted affordances on Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens to encourage future research in this area.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单纯复形的多维度持久层拉普拉斯框架，用于图像分析，解决了PCA对降维维度敏感的问题，实验显示其在中等维度范围内性能优于PCA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对常用降维技术（如PCA）对降维维度选择的敏感性，提出利用多个降维维度的互补优势，避免单一维度选择或跨维度平均结果的局限性。

Method: 通过将图像样本视为单纯复形，利用持久层拉普拉斯提取多尺度局部拓扑谱表示，并在不同维度和尺度上聚合统计摘要，形成多尺度多维度的图像表示。

Result: 在COIL20和ETH80图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在广泛的降维范围内表现稳定，并在中等维度范围内持续优于基于PCA的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多维度持久层拉普拉斯（MPSL）框架在图像分析中表现出色，尤其在中等维度范围内，相比基于PCA的基线方法，性能更稳定且有所提升。

Abstract: We propose a multi-dimensional persistent sheaf Laplacian (MPSL) framework on simplicial complexes for image analysis. The proposed method is motivated by the strong sensitivity of commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to the choice of reduced dimension. Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically delineate lesions on computed tomography (CT) and generate radiology report content, yet progress is limited by the scarcity of publicly available CT datasets with lesion-level annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CT-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset comprising two components: a Lesion Image and Metadata Set containing 20,335 lesions from 7,795 CT studies with bounding boxes, descriptions, and size information, and a multitask visual question answering benchmark with 2,850 QA pairs covering lesion localization, description, size estimation, and attribute categorization. Hard negative examples are included to reflect real-world diagnostic challenges. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art multimodal models, including vision-language and medical CLIP variants, by comparing their performance to radiologist assessments, demonstrating the value of CT-Bench as a comprehensive benchmark for lesion analysis. Moreover, fine-tuning models on the Lesion Image and Metadata Set yields significant performance gains across both components, underscoring the clinical utility of CT-Bench.

Conclusion: Wrivinder 和 MC-Sat 为无监督的几何中心跨视角对齐任务提供了首个全面的基准和测试平台，展示了基于几何聚合的稳健地面到卫星定位的潜力。

Abstract: Aligning ground-level imagery with geo-registered satellite maps is crucial for mapping, navigation, and situational awareness, yet remains challenging under large viewpoint gaps or when GPS is unreliable. We introduce Wrivinder, a zero-shot, geometry-driven framework that aggregates multiple ground photographs to reconstruct a consistent 3D scene and align it with overhead satellite imagery. Wrivinder combines SfM reconstruction, 3D Gaussian Splatting, semantic grounding, and monocular depth--based metric cues to produce a stable zenith-view rendering that can be directly matched to satellite context for metrically accurate camera geo-localization. To support systematic evaluation of this task, which lacks suitable benchmarks, we also release MC-Sat, a curated dataset linking multi-view ground imagery with geo-registered satellite tiles across diverse outdoor environments. Together, Wrivinder and MC-Sat provide a first comprehensive baseline and testbed for studying geometry-centered cross-view alignment without paired supervision. In zero-shot experiments, Wrivinder achieves sub-30\,m geolocation accuracy across both dense and large-area scenes, highlighting the promise of geometry-based aggregation for robust ground-to-satellite localization.

TL;DR: AnchorWeave通过局部几何记忆和多锚点控制解决了长期视频生成中的跨视图不对齐问题，提升了生成质量和场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的方法在从重建的全局3D场景中渲染锚点视频时，由于姿态和深度估计误差导致跨视图不对齐，进而污染条件信号并降低生成质量。

Method: AnchorWeave采用覆盖驱动的局部记忆检索与目标轨迹对齐，并通过多锚点编织控制器在生成过程中整合选定的局部记忆。

Result: 实验证明，AnchorWeave在长期场景一致性方面表现显著优于现有方法，同时保持了良好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: AnchorWeave显著提升了长期场景一致性，同时保持了强大的视觉质量，通过局部几何条件、多锚点控制和覆盖驱动检索的有效性验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.

TL;DR: ThermEval-B基准揭示了现有视觉语言模型在热图像处理上的局限性，强调需要专用评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热感测在可见光失效的场景（如夜间监视、搜索救援、自动驾驶和医疗筛查）中至关重要，但现有的RGB中心视觉语言模型无法泛化到热图像。

Method: 通过整合公共数据集和新收集的ThermEval-D数据集（提供密集的每像素温度图和语义身体部位注释），构建了包含约55,000个热视觉问答对的ThermEval-B基准。

Result: 评估25个开源和闭源视觉语言模型发现，这些模型在温度基础推理、色彩映射变换下表现不佳，仅通过提示或有监督微调获得边际增益。

Conclusion: ThermEval-B 作为一个专门的热视觉语言理解基准，展示了现有视觉语言模型在热图像处理上的不足，强调了需要超越RGB中心假设的专用评估方法。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on RGB imagery, but they do not generalize to thermal images. Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发一个高效的生成框架，能够在单次前向传递中生成图像，并与多步扩散模型竞争，同时减少推理步骤。

Method: 通过学习一个将自然图像均匀映射到球形潜在空间的编码器，以及一个将随机潜在向量映射回图像空间的解码器，仅通过图像重建损失进行训练。

Result: Sphere Encoder在少于五个步骤的情况下，生成图像质量与多步扩散模型相当。

Conclusion: Sphere Encoder在多个数据集上表现出与最先进的扩散模型相竞争的性能，同时大幅降低了推理成本。

Abstract: We introduce the Sphere Encoder, an efficient generative framework capable of producing images in a single forward pass and competing with many-step diffusion models using fewer than five steps. Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

Motivation: 现有视频修复模型在处理局部编辑时效率低下，计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: EditCtrl 采用局部视频上下文模块，仅处理掩码标记，计算成本与编辑大小成正比，并结合轻量级全局上下文嵌入器确保视频整体一致性。

Result: EditCtrl 的计算效率比现有方法高 10 倍，同时在编辑质量上优于全注意力设计的方法。

Conclusion: EditCtrl 是一种高效的视频修复控制框架，通过局部优先生成和轻量级全局上下文嵌入，显著提高了计算效率，并在编辑质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: High-fidelity generative video editing has seen significant quality improvements by leveraging pre-trained video foundation models. However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.

TL;DR: TEG通过热力学治理替代传统编排，利用去中心化架构和物理模型解决Exascale扩展性问题，理论证明其稳定性与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云计算向Exascale规模扩展，传统集中式编排范式（如Kubernetes）面临物理极限，无法应对下一代AI工作负载的随机性。

Method: 引入TEG（热经济调控器），一种去中心化架构，通过朗之万代理在Holographic Potential Field上执行布朗运动，将决策复杂度降至O(1)，并通过宏观Landau相变机制和Token Evaporation维持系统稳定性。

Result: 理论分析证明：(1) 系统通过Dual-Number Damping渐进收敛至纳什均衡；(2) OOM灾难性故障通过OS级Airlock Mutex转化为可管理的Glassy States；(3) 高惯性下安全性由高阶控制屏障函数（HOCBF）数学保证。

Conclusion: TEG提出了一种从编排到热力学治理的范式转变，证明了在Exascale规模下，涌现秩序而非确定性控制是实现可扩展性的必要条件。

Abstract: As cloud computing scales toward the Exascale regime ($10^5+$ nodes), the prevailing "Newtonian" orchestration paradigm -- exemplified by Kubernetes -- approaches fundamental physical limits. The centralized, deterministic scheduling model suffers from $O(N)$ latency scaling, "Head-of-Line" blocking, and thermodynamic blindness, rendering it incapable of managing the stochastic chaos of next-generation AI workloads. This paper proposes a paradigm shift from orchestration to Thermodynamic Governance. We model the compute cluster not as a static state machine, but as a Dissipative Structure far from equilibrium. We introduce TEG (Thermo-Economic Governor), a decentralized architecture that establishes a rigorous topological isomorphism between cluster resource contention and many-body physics. TEG replaces the global scheduler with Langevin Agents that execute Brownian motion on a Holographic Potential Field, reducing decision complexity to $O(1)$. System stability is maintained via a macro-scale Landau Phase Transition mechanism, which modulates global damping (taxation) to physically dissolve deadlocks. Crucially, we enforce Token Evaporation to mirror entropy dissipation, preventing economic inflation and ensuring an open thermodynamic system. We provide formal theoretical analysis proving that: (1) The system converges asymptotically to a Nash Equilibrium via Dual-Number Damping; (2) OOM catastrophic failures are converted into manageable Glassy States via an OS-level Airlock Mutex; and (3) Safety is mathematically guaranteed under high inertia using High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBF). TEG demonstrates that emergent order, rather than deterministic control, is the necessary condition for Exascale scalability.

Conclusion: ML-ECS框架通过跨模态对比学习、自适应多模态调整、模态感知模型聚合和SLM增强的CCL，有效解决了边缘环境中多模态学习的异质性问题，显著提升了性能并实现了高效的通信。

Abstract: Edge-cloud synergies provide a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving deployment of foundation models, where lightweight on-device models adapt to domain-specific data and cloud-hosted models coordinate knowledge sharing. However, in real-world edge environments, collaborative multimodal learning is challenged by modality heterogeneity (different modality combinations across domains) and model-structure heterogeneity (different modality-specific encoders/fusion modules. To address these issues, we propose ML-ECS, a collaborative multimodal learning framework that enables joint training between a server-based model and heterogeneous edge models. This framework consists of four components: (1) cross-modal contrastive learning (CCL) to align modality representations in a shared latent space, (2) adaptive multimodal tuning (AMT) to preserve domain-specific knowledge from local datasets, (3) modality-aware model aggregation (MMA) to robustly aggregate while mitigating noise caused by missing modalities, and (4) SLM-enhanced CCL (SE-CCL) to facilitate bidirectional knowledge transfer between cloud and edge. Experimental results on various multimodal tasks show that \pname consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines under varying modality availability, achieving improvements of 5.44% to 12.08% in Rouge-LSum and improving both client- and server-side performance. In addition, by communicating only low-rank LoRA parameters and fused representations, ML-ECS achieves high communication efficiency, requiring only 0.65% of the total parameter volume.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-time systems remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands and privacy concerns. We propose Floe, a hybrid federated learning framework designed for latency-sensitive, resource-constrained environments. Floe combines a cloud-based black-box LLM with lightweight small language models (SLMs) on edge devices to enable low-latency, privacy-preserving inference. Personal data and fine-tuning remain on-device, while the cloud LLM contributes general knowledge without exposing proprietary weights. A heterogeneity-aware LoRA adaptation strategy enables efficient edge deployment across diverse hardware, and a logit-level fusion mechanism enables real-time coordination between edge and cloud models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Floe enhances user privacy and personalization. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and reduces inference latency on edge devices under real-time constraints compared with baseline approaches.

Conclusion: AMPD显著提高了多轮LLM推理的服务水平目标（SLO）达成率，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-round workflows, such as autonomous agents and iterative retrieval, have become increasingly prevalent. However, this raises hurdles for serving LLMs under prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation, a widely adopted paradigm that separates the compute-bound prefill phase and memory-bound decode phase onto individual resources. Specifically, existing systems overlook the interleaved prefill-decode workload pattern in multi-round inference, leading to sub-optimal handling of the incremental prefill workloads and model deployment for the two phases.
  In this work, we present AMPD, a brand new disaggregated serving framework for multi-round LLM inference. The core of AMPD is to coordinate the prefill workloads based on real-time workloads by adaptively determining where to carry out these workloads and how they are scheduled, in order to maximize service level objective (SLO) attainment. In addition, we tailor a planning algorithm for our scenario, facilitating the deduction of optimal resource allocation and parallel strategies for the two phases. Empirical results demonstrate that AMPD substantially improves SLO attainment compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Code review is a critical practice in modern software engineering, helping developers detect defects early, improve code quality, and facilitate knowledge sharing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment. This survey provides a structured foundation for developing more realistic and comprehensive benchmarks for LLM-based code review.

Method: 提出了InEx-Bug数据集，包含377个GitHub问题的手动标注，分类为内部缺陷、外部依赖/环境问题、非缺陷或未知。

Result: 分析显示，内部缺陷解决更快（中位数8.9天 vs 10.2天）、关闭率更高（92% vs 78%）、更常需要代码变更（57% vs 28%），而外部缺陷重开率更高（12% vs 4%）且复发延迟更长（中位数157天 vs 87天）。

Conclusion: 该数据集为深入研究NPM生态系统中的内部和外部缺陷奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the causes of software defects is essential for reliable software maintenance and ecosystem stability. However, existing bug datasets do not distinguish between issues originating within a project from those caused by external dependencies or environmental factors. In this paper we present InEx-Bug, a manually annotated dataset of 377 GitHub issues from 103 NPM repositories, categorizing issues as Intrinsic (internal defect), Extrinsic (dependency/environment issue), Not-a-Bug, or Unknown. Beyond labels, the dataset includes rich temporal and behavioral metadata such as maintainer participation, code changes, and reopening patterns. Analyses show Intrinsic bugs resolve faster (median 8.9 vs 10.2 days), are close more often (92% vs 78%), and require code changes more frequently (57% vs 28%) compared to Extrinsic bugs. While Extrinsic bugs exhibit higher reopen rates (12% vs 4%) and delayed recurrence (median 157 vs 87 days). The dataset provides a foundation for further studying Intrinsic and Extrinsic defects in the NPM ecosystem.

TL;DR: DrillAgent通过迭代的假设-验证-精炼流程，结合LLM和程序状态反馈，显著提升PoV生成效率，解决了复杂语义约束的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化漏洞验证和补丁验证中，满足复杂语义约束是主要瓶颈，现有LLM方法缺乏对具体执行行为的充分理解。

Method: DrillAgent采用迭代的假设-验证-精炼流程，结合LLM的语义推理和程序执行状态的反馈，通过将低级执行轨迹转换为源级约束来精确生成PoV。

Result: 在SEC-bench基准测试中，DrillAgent在固定预算条件下比现有最佳LLM基线多解决了52.8%的CVE任务。

Conclusion: DrillAgent通过结合LLM的语义推理和具体程序状态的反馈，显著提高了PoV生成的可靠性和效率，特别是在复杂软件系统中。

Abstract: Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) generation is a critical task in software security, serving as a cornerstone for vulnerability validation, false positive reduction, and patch verification. While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs.
  In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the necessity of execution-state-aware reasoning for reliable PoV generation in complex software systems.

*Xiao He,Ru Chen,Jialun Cao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究提出DesBench评估LLMs在软件设计任务上的表现，发现LLMs在设计相关任务中存在挑战，需进一步研究适合LLM的设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注实现，忽视了软件设计的重要性，因此研究LLMs是否能处理软件设计及按特定设计编写代码。

Method: 提出DesBench，一个设计感知的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在三个软件设计相关任务上的表现：设计感知代码生成、面向对象建模和验收测试用例设计。

Result: LLMs在仅提供高层或无设计时难以生成正确代码；在面向对象建模中能识别对象和类，但在定义操作和类间关系时存在挑战；验收测试用例的代码覆盖质量与人类编写相当。

Conclusion: LLMs目前在处理软件设计方面仍存在显著挑战，需要进一步研究适合基于LLM开发的新设计方法和语言。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) are extensively utilized to enhance development efficiency, leading to numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance. However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development.

*Gianpietro Castiglione,Shahriar Ebrahimi,Narges Khakpour*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VeriSBOM 是一个通过零知识证明实现选择性披露和验证的 SBOM 框架，解决了 SBOM 敏感信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SBOM 通常包含敏感信息，组织不愿完全披露，以避免技术风险（如暴露专有依赖或未修补漏洞）和业务风险（如暴露架构策略）。

Method: VeriSBOM 利用可扩展的向量承诺方案和基于折叠的证明聚合，生成简洁的零知识证明，以验证安全和合规性。

Result: VeriSBOM 在真实世界的软件包注册表上实现了可扩展、隐私保护且可验证的 SBOM 共享与验证。

Conclusion: VeriSBOM 提供了一种无需信任、选择性披露的 SBOM 框架，通过零知识证明实现了 SBOM 的加密可验证性，同时保护了敏感信息的机密性。

Abstract: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a key component for the transparency of software supply chain; it is a structured inventory of the components, dependencies, and associated metadata of a software artifact. However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments. We implement VeriSBOM, analyze its security, and evaluate its performance on real-world package registries. The results show that our method enables scalable, privacy-preserving, and verifiable SBOM sharing and validation.

TL;DR: ARC通过双向测试驱动循环，将多模态DSL文档直接编译为可运行Web系统，显著提升测试通过率和开发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多模态文档需求扩展时性能下降的问题，提升从需求到可运行系统的生成效率。

Method: 采用双向测试驱动的代理循环，包括自上而下的架构阶段和自下而上的实现阶段，确保严格的可追溯性。

Result: 生成6个可运行Web系统，GUI测试通过率平均提升50.6%；用户研究表明新手可在5.6小时内编写复杂系统的DSL文档。

Conclusion: ARC技术有效将复杂需求规范转化为可维护、可运行的软件，显著提升GUI测试通过率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved programming efficiency, but their performance degrades significantly as requirements scale; when faced with multi-modal documents containing hundreds of scenarios, LLMs often produce incorrect implementations or omit constraints. We propose Agentic Requirement Compilation (ARC), a technique that moves beyond simple code generation to requirement compilation, enabling the creation of runnable web systems directly from multi-modal DSL documents. ARC generates not only source code but also modular designs for UI, API, and database layers, enriched test suites (unit, modular, and integration), and detailed traceability for software maintenance. Our approach employs a bidirectional test-driven agentic loop: a top-down architecture phase decomposes requirements into verifiable interfaces, followed by a bottom-up implementation phase where agents generate code to satisfy those tests. ARC maintains strict traceability across requirements, design, and code to facilitate intelligent asset reuse. We evaluated ARC by generating six runnable web systems from documents spanning 50-200 multi-modal scenarios. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ARC-generated systems pass 50.6% more GUI tests on average. A user study with 21 participants showed that novice users can successfully write DSL documents for complex systems, such as a 10K-line ticket-booking system, in an average of 5.6 hours. These results demonstrate that ARC effectively transforms non-trivial requirement specifications into maintainable, runnable software.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GenAI工具在敏捷团队中长期应用显著提升绩效和效率，但活动量不变，验证了SPACE等多维框架的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GenAI工具（如GitHub Copilot和GPT工具）对软件工程的影响显而易见，但大多数研究是短期的、聚焦于个体实验。团队层面在工业敏捷环境中的持续生产力影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用多案例纵向研究，涉及一家大型技术咨询公司的3个敏捷团队，持续约13个月。通过收集并比较历史（采用前）和研究（采用后）冲刺中的定量遥测数据（Jira、SonarQube、Git）和定性调查数据。

Result: 研究发现，GenAI显著提升了团队绩效和开发者福祉，尤其是绩效和感知效率的显著提升，而活动量保持稳定。

Conclusion: GenAI工具可以显著提升团队绩效和开发者福祉。研究发现，开发者的绩效和感知效率显著提升，而活动量保持稳定，这表明GenAI提高了开发工作的价值密度而非工作量。

Abstract: Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot and GPT tools, represent a paradigm shift in software engineering. While their impact is clear, most studies are short-term, focused on individual experiments. The sustained, team-level effects on productivity within industrial agile environments remain largely uncharacterized. Goal: This study aims to provide a longitudinal evaluation of GenAI's impact on agile software teams. We characterize its effect on developers' productivity by applying the multi-dimensional SPACE framework. Method: We conducted a multi-case longitudinal study involving 3 agile teams at a large technology consulting firm for around 13 months. We collected and compared quantitative telemetry (Jira, SonarQube, Git) and qualitative survey data from historical (pre-adoption) and research (post-adoption) sprints. Conclusion: GenAI tools can significantly improve team performance and well-being. Our key finding is a sharp increase in Performance and perceived Efficiency concurrent with flat developer Activity. This suggests GenAI increases the value density of development work, not its volume. This finding validates the necessity of multi-dimensional frameworks like SPACE to capture the true, nuanced impact of GenAI in situ, which would be invisible to studies measuring Activity alone.

TL;DR: 将冒名顶替现象视为‘人类债务’，呼吁通过文化重构和盟友关系解决环境因素，尤其关注弱势群体的负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冒名顶替现象对软件工程从业者影响广泛，但通常仅从个体内部视角看待，忽视了环境因素的作用。本文旨在揭示其系统性根源。

Method: 通过将IP与ICSE2026预调查结果关联，类比技术债务的概念，分析其在软件工程领域的社会技术生态系统中的积累和分布。

Result: 研究发现‘人类债务’在代表性不足的工程师和研究人员中负担更重，传统等级结构和学术环境加剧了这一现象。

Conclusion: 本文提出将冒名顶替现象（IP）视为一种‘人类债务’，并建议通过文化重构、透明度和盟友关系的主动维护来缓解这一问题，强调领导者和机构需解决加剧这些感受的环境因素。

Abstract: The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) impacts a significant portion of the Software Engineering workforce, yet it is often viewed primarily through an internal individual lens. In this position paper, we propose framing the prevalence of IP as a form of Human Debt and discuss the relation with the ICSE2026 Pre Survey on the Future of Software Engineering results. Similar to technical debt, which arises when short-term goals are prioritized over long-term structural integrity, Human Debt accumulates due to gaps in psychological safety and inclusive support within socio-technical ecosystems. We observe that this debt is not distributed equally, it weighs heavier on underrepresented engineers and researchers, who face compounded challenges within traditional hierarchical structures and academic environments. We propose cultural refactoring, transparency and active maintenance through allyship, suggesting that leaders and institutions must address the environmental factors that exacerbate these feelings, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for all professionals.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了结构化团体辅导对减少早期职业软件工程师冒名顶替现象（IP）感受的影响。结果显示辅导有一定效果，但团队协作和项目情境的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冒名顶替现象（IP）在软件工程（SE）中普遍存在，尽管有证据表明能力，但仍持续感到自己是欺诈者。虽然提出了辅导等干预措施来缓解IP，但在SE中的实证证据仍不足。

Method: 研究采用准实验设计，20名参与者分布在两个项目团队中，使用等待列表控制设计，并辅以非参与者观察。治疗组接受了三阶段的辅导干预，而对照组在观察阶段后才接受干预。使用Clance冒名顶替现象量表（CIPS）评估IP，同时评估幸福感（WHO-5）、生活满意度（SWLS）和情感（PANAS）。

Result: 辅导导致CIPS评分略有下降，而对照组在观察阶段也有所改善，表明情境和时间因素可能比正式干预产生更强的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，辅导可能有助于与冒名顶替现象（IP）相关的反思和意识提升，但团队协作和项目工作的其他情境因素也可能促成这些变化。本研究为理解结构化IP干预在软件工程环境中的作用提供了新的实证基础。

Abstract: Context: The Impostor Phenomenon (IP), the persistent belief of being a fraud despite evident competence, is common in Software Engineering (SE), where high expectations for expertise and innovation prevail. Although coaching and similar interventions are proposed to mitigate IP, empirical evidence in SE remains underexplored.
  Objective: This study examines the impact of a structured group coaching intervention on reducing IP feelings among early-career software engineers.
  Method: We conducted a quasi-experiment with 20 participants distributed across two project teams using a wait-list control design, complemented by non-participant observation. The treatment group received a three-session coaching intervention, while the control group received it after an observation phase. IP was assessed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), alongside evaluated measures of well-being (WHO-5), life satisfaction (SWLS), and affect (PANAS).
  Results: The coaching resulted in modest reductions in CIPS scores, whereas the control group also improved during the observation phase, suggesting that contextual and temporal factors may have exerted a stronger influence than the formal intervention.
  Conclusion: These results suggest that coaching may support reflection and awareness related to IP, yet other contextual aspects of team collaboration and project work might also contribute to these changes. This study offers a novel empirical step toward understanding how structured IP interventions operate within SE environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了早期职业软件工程师视角下的在线招聘积极实践（CPs），通过访谈识别了22个CPs，旨在改善候选人体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线招聘和选拔（R&S）过程通常是早期职业软件工程师与科技行业的第一次接触，但许多候选人认为这些过程不透明、低效甚至令人沮丧。尽管先前研究广泛记录了在线科技招聘中的缺陷和偏见，但对创造积极候选人体验的实践知之甚少。

Method: 本研究采用申请人归因反应理论为指导，进行了22次半结构化访谈，参与者共同描述了超过470次在线R&S经历。

Result: 通过主题分析，研究者确定了22个构建性模式（CPs），反映了积极的实践，如全面透明的职位广告（CP01）、具体和发展的反馈（CP03）、人性化和尊重的互动（CP06），以及将过程视为双向选择（CP18）。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是，研究结果将科技招聘的讨论从诊断功能障碍扩展到设计以人为本和以成长为导向的候选人体验。CPs目录为组织提供了一个具体且基于实证的资源，以更有效地吸引和支持早期职业软件工程师。

Abstract: [Context] Online Recruitment and Selection (R&S) processes are often the first point of contact between early-career software engineers and the tech industry. Yet many candidates experience these processes as opaque, inefficient, or even discouraging. While prior research has extensively documented the flaws and biases in online tech hiring, little is known about the practices that create positive candidate experiences. [Objective & Method] This paper explores such practices, referred to as Constructive Patterns (CPs), from the perspective of early-career software engineers. Guided by Applicant Attribution-Reaction Theory, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews in which participants collectively described over 470 online R&S experiences. [Results] Through thematic analysis, we identified 22 CPs that reflect positive practices such as comprehensive and transparent job advertisements (CP01), specific and developmental feedback (CP03), humanized and respectful interaction (CP06), and framing the process as a two-way street (CP18). [Conclusion] Our findings extend the conversation on tech hiring beyond diagnosing dysfunctions toward designing for human-centered and growth-oriented candidate experiences. The resulting catalog of CPs provides a concrete and empirically grounded resource for organizations seeking to attract and support early-career software engineers more effectively.

Conclusion: 该论文通过实证评估，揭示了自动化生成和验证ACSL规范的能力与局限性，为相关领域提供了新的实证证据。

Abstract: Formal specifications are crucial for building verifiable and dependable software systems, yet generating accurate and verifiable specifications for real-world C programs remains challenging. This paper empirically evaluates the extent to which formal-analysis tools can automatically generate and verify ACSL specifications without human or learning-based assistance. We conduct a controlled study on a recently released dataset of 506 C programs, repurposing it from interactive, developer-driven workflows to an automated evaluation setting. Five ACSL generation systems are compared: a rule-based Python script, Frama-C's RTE plugin, and three large language models--DeepSeek-V3.2, GPT-5.2, and OLMo 3.1 32B Instruct. All generated specifications are verified under identical conditions using the Frama-C WP plugin powered by multiple SMT solvers, allowing a direct comparison of annotation quality, solver sensitivity, and proof stability. Our results provide new empirical evidence on the capabilities and limitations of automated ACSL generation, complementing prior survey-based work.

TL;DR: CodeGlance基准测试揭示了LLM在现实代码推理中的挑战，尤其是未见函数推理对较小模型的困难，并提供了改进策略的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发中，开发者需要快速理解代码行为，但现有研究主要关注孤立代码片段，忽略了涉及外部API交互和陌生函数的现实场景复杂性。

Method: 提出了CodeGlance，一个多维基准测试，调查了三种现实场景下的代码推理挑战：内在逻辑推理、API交互推理和未见函数推理。通过系统评估7种最先进的LLM，揭示了未见函数推理对较小模型的显著挑战。

Result: 研究发现，未见函数推理对较小模型尤其具有挑战性，Qwen2.5-3b在未见函数上的准确率仅为6.0%，而在熟悉API上为37.5%。还识别了影响代码推理难度的关键代码复杂性特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更强大的代码推理系统和在实际软件开发中部署基于LLM的编程助手提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: In modern software development, developers frequently need to understand code behavior at a glance -- whether reviewing pull requests, debugging issues, or navigating unfamiliar codebases. This ability to reason about dynamic program behavior is fundamental to effective software engineering and increasingly supported by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies on code reasoning focus primarily on isolated code snippets, overlooking the complexity of real-world scenarios involving external API interactions and unfamiliar functions. This gap hinders our understanding of what truly makes code reasoning challenging for LLMs across diverse programming contexts.
  We present CodeGlance, a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios: intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. Through systematic evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that unseen function reasoning poses significant challenges especially for smaller models, with Qwen2.5-3b achieving only 6.0\% accuracy on unseen functions compared to 37.5\% on familiar APIs. We identify critical code complexity features -- including execution trace length, API invocation count, and control flow complexity -- that significantly impact code reasoning difficulty across scenarios. We further investigate how common augmentation strategies, including CoT, document retrieval, and code search, can improve reasoning performance, finding that their effectiveness varies substantially depending on whether challenges stem from logical complexity or knowledge gaps. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing more capable code reasoning systems and deploying LLM-based programming assistants in real-world software development.

Motivation: 深度学习库的单元测试因复杂的数值语义和隐式张量约束而具有挑战性，传统搜索基软件测试和大型语言模型在此方面存在不足。

Method: ATTest采用七阶段流水线，包括约束提取和迭代的“生成-验证-修复”循环，以保持测试稳定性并缓解上下文窗口饱和问题。

Result: 在PyTorch和TensorFlow上的评估显示，ATTest显著优于现有基线，平均分支覆盖率分别达到55.60%和54.77%。

Conclusion: ATTest通过代理驱动的工作流程有效填补了数值库中的语义鸿沟，同时确保了可审计的测试合成。

Abstract: The unit testing of Deep Learning (DL) libraries is challenging due to complex numerical semantics and implicit tensor constraints. Traditional Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) often suffers from semantic blindness, failing to satisfy the constraints of high-dimensional tensors, whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with cross-file context and unstable code modifications. This paper proposes ATTest, an agent-driven tensor testing framework for module-level unit test generation. ATTest orchestrates a seven-stage pipeline, which encompasses constraint extraction and an iterative "generation-validation-repair" loop, to maintain testing stability and mitigate context-window saturation. An evaluation on PyTorch and TensorFlow demonstrates that ATTest significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as PynguinML, achieving an average branch coverage of 55.60% and 54.77%, respectively. The results illustrate how agent-driven workflows bridge the semantic gap in numerical libraries while ensuring auditable test synthesis. Source code: https://github.com/iSEngLab/ATTest.git

Motivation: 手动软件维护劳动密集、耗时且易出错，自动化需求迫切。基于迁移的方法在API演进适应、软件测试和补丁迁移等任务中展现出潜力，是值得深入研究的自动化维护方向。

Method: 通过四个关键阶段（识别维护任务、选择迁移源、跨系统匹配数据并适应目标上下文、验证迁移的正确性）来表征基于迁移的维护生命周期，并分析各阶段的挑战。

Result: 提出了首个关于基于迁移的软件维护方法的系统性研究议程，并详细分析了各阶段的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个系统性的研究议程，旨在推动基于迁移的软件维护方法的发展，并鼓励社区解决相关关键挑战以推进自动化软件维护。

Abstract: Maintenance is a critical stage in the software lifecycle, ensuring that post-release systems remain reliable, efficient, and adaptable. However, manual software maintenance is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, which highlights the urgent need for automation. Learning from maintenance activities conducted on other software systems offers an effective way to improve efficiency. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that migration-based approaches transfer knowledge, artifacts, or solutions from one system to another and show strong potential in tasks such as API evolution adaptation, software testing, and migrating patches for fault correction. This makes migration-based maintenance a valuable research direction for advancing automated maintenance.
  This paper takes a step further by presenting the first systematic research agenda on migration-based approaches to software maintenance. We characterize the migration-based maintenance lifecycle through four key stages: \ding{182} identifying a maintenance task that can be addressed through migration, \ding{183} selecting suitable migration sources for the target project,\ding{184} matching relevant data across systems and adapting the migrated data to the target context, and \ding{185} validating the correctness of the migration. We also analyze the challenges that may arise at each stage. Our goal is to encourage the community to explore migration-based approaches more thoroughly and to tackle the key challenges that must be solved to advance automated software maintenance.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.

### [180] [An Empirical Study of the Evolution of GitHub Actions Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14572)
*Pooya Rostami Mazrae,Alexandre Decan,Tom Mens,Mairieli Wessel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了GitHub Actions工作流的变化，发现修改多为小规模且集中在任务配置，未受LLM工具显著影响，呼吁改进工具支持细粒度维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CI/CD实践在协作软件开发中通过自动化耗时和重复性任务（如测试、构建、质量检查、依赖和安全管理）发挥重要作用，GitHub Actions作为集成到GitHub的CI/CD工具，允许仓库维护者自动化开发工作流。

Method: 采用混合方法分析GitHub Actions工作流随时间的变化，包括对439个修改工作流文件的初步定性分析和对49K+ GitHub仓库的定量分析。

Result: 分析显示仓库中位数包含三个工作流文件，7.3%的工作流文件每周被修改，且修改通常较小（约75%仅包含单一更改）。大多数更改与任务配置和任务规范相关，未发现LLM编码工具或其他重大技术变化对工作流创建和维护频率的明确影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了改进工具支持细粒度维护任务的必要性，如更广泛采用依赖管理和基于AI的支持，以确保和维持工作流的安全与质量。

Abstract: CI/CD practices play a significant role during collaborative software development by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as testing, building, quality checking, dependency and security management. GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change. The large majority of the observed changes have to do with task configuration and task specification in workflow jobs. We did not find any conclusive evidence of the effect of LLM coding tools or other major technological changes on workflow creation and workflow maintenance frequency. Our findings highlight the need for improved tooling to support fine-grained maintenance tasks, such as a broader adoption of dependency management and AI-based support for ensuring and sustaining workflow security and quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化分类源代码变更以提高软件开发过程中的审查效率。

Method: 采用k-means算法和余弦相似度度量，基于11种源代码指标（如代码行数、圈复杂度等）进行聚类分析。

Result: 在五个软件系统（包括Subversion和NHibernate）中验证，分类纯度P_C = 0.75 ± 0.05，熵E_C = 0.37 ± 0.06（显著性水平0.05）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动化聚类和专家映射的结合，显著减少了代码变更审查的时间，并在五个软件系统中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents an automated method for classifying source code changes during the software development process based on clustering of change metrics. The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.

TL;DR: ACR工具在语义等效代码变体上的一致性差，正确修订能力下降45.3%，现有缓解策略效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ACR工具在面对语义等效代码变体时的一致性表现，以评估其实际应用价值。

Method: 设计了九种语义保留扰动（SPP），应用于2032个真实GitHub项目的Java方法，生成超过10K扰动变体，评估了五种基于Transformer的ACR工具的一致性。

Result: ACR工具在语义等效代码上的正确修订生成能力下降高达45.3%，扰动越接近目标区域，失败概率越高。

Conclusion: ACR工具在语义等效代码变体上的一致性表现不佳，正确修订生成能力下降高达45.3%，现有缓解策略效果有限，仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question.

TL;DR: 研究发现PR描述在代码评审中至关重要，尤其是目的、代码解释和反馈类型元素。描述在成熟项目和复杂变更中更常见，实际效用驱动其撰写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补PR描述角色尚未系统研究的空白，探究其对代码评审结果的影响。

Method: 采用混合方法实证研究，包括灰色文献回顾、对80K GitHub PR的分析（涵盖156个项目及五种编程语言）、64名开发者的调查，以及提交时因素的分析。

Result: 建立了PR描述的八元素分类法，发现不同元素与评审结果（如合并决策、延迟、首次响应时间等）存在关联。开发者认为目的和代码解释最重要，而反馈类型最能预测评审效果。

Conclusion: 研究发现，开发者认为PR描述很重要，但不同元素的重要性不同：目的和代码解释有助于保留变更的理据和历史，而明确反馈类型最能预测变更的接受和评审参与度。PR描述在成熟项目和复杂变更中更常见，表明它们在实际有用时被撰写，而非形式化。

Abstract: In the pull-based development model, code contributions are submitted as pull requests (PRs) to undergo reviews and approval by other developers with the goal of being merged into the code base. A PR can be supported by a description, whose role has not yet been systematically investigated. To fill in this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study of PR descriptions. We conducted a grey literature review of guidelines on writing PR descriptions and derived a taxonomy of eight recommended elements. Using this taxonomy, we analyzed 80K GitHub PRs across 156 projects and five programming languages to assess associations between these elements and code review outcomes (e.g., merge decision, latency, first response time, review comments, and review iteration cycles). To complement these results, we surveyed 64 developers about the perceived importance of each element. Finally, we analyzed which submission-time factors predict whether PRs include a description and which elements they contain. We found that developers view PR descriptions as important, but their elements matter differently: purpose and code explanations are valued by developers for preserving the rationale and history of changes, while stating the desired feedback type best predicts change acceptance and reviewer engagement. PR descriptions are also more common in mature projects and complex changes, suggesting they are written when most useful rather than as a formality.

Conclusion: 研究发现为纵向和实验研究提供了实证基线，探讨配置策略如何随着AI编码工具的成熟而演变及其对代理性能的影响。

Abstract: Agentic AI coding tools with autonomous capabilities beyond conversational content generation increasingly automate repetitive and time-consuming software development tasks. Developers can configure these tools through versioned repository-level artifacts such as Markdown and JSON files. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of configuration mechanisms for agentic AI coding tools, covering Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex. We identify eight configuration mechanisms and, in an empirical study of 2,926 GitHub repositories, examine whether and how they are adopted. We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature.

Motivation: 工具描述在指导基础模型选择合适工具和传递正确参数中起关键作用，但描述中的缺陷或异味可能误导代理，其普遍性和后果尚不明确。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，分析了856个工具的描述质量及其对代理性能的影响，开发了基于六个组件的评分标准，并通过基于基础模型的扫描器操作化这一标准。

Result: 97.1%的工具描述至少存在一种异味，56%未能明确说明其目的。改进描述可提高任务成功率（中位数5.85个百分点）和部分目标完成率（15.12%），但增加执行步骤（67.46%）并在16.67%的情况下导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究发现，工具描述的质量对基于基础模型的代理性能有显著影响，改进描述可以提高任务成功率，但也会增加执行成本。此外，不同组件组合的紧凑变体可以在保持行为可靠性的同时减少不必要的标记开销。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how Foundation Model (FM)-based agents interact with external systems by invoking tools. However, to understand a tool's purpose and features, FMs rely on natural-language tool descriptions, making these descriptions a critical component in guiding FMs to select the optimal tool for a given (sub)task and to pass the right arguments to the tool. While defects or smells in these descriptions can misguide FM-based agents, their prevalence and consequences in the MCP ecosystem remain unclear.
  To address this, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of 856 tools spread across 103 MCP servers, assessing their description quality and their impact on agent performance. We identify six components of tool descriptions from the literature, develop a scoring rubric utilizing these components, then formalize tool description smells based on this rubric. By operationalizing this rubric through an FM-based scanner, we find that 97.1% of the analyzed tool descriptions contain at least one smell, with 56% failing to state their purpose clearly. While augmenting these descriptions for all components improves task success rates by a median of 5.85 percentage points and improves partial goal completion by 15.12%, it also increases the number of execution steps by 67.46% and regresses performance in 16.67% of cases. These findings highlight a trade-off between agent performance and cost, as well as the context sensitivity of the performance gain. Furthermore, component ablations show that compact variants of different component combinations often preserve behavioral reliability while reducing unnecessary token overhead, enabling more efficient use of the FM context window and lower execution costs.

Abstract: In complex Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, UAVs can establish dynamic and heterogeneous links with one another for various purposes, such as communication coverage, collective sensing, and task collaboration. These interactions give rise to dynamic multiplex UAV networks, where each layer represents a distinct type of interaction among UAVs. Understanding how such links form and evolve is both of theoretical interest and of practical importance for the control and maintenance of networked UAV systems. In this paper, we first develop a dynamic multiplex network model for UAV networks to characterize their dynamic and heterogeneous link properties. We then propose a cross-layer fusion-based deep learning model, termed CLF-ULP, to predict future inter-UAV links based on historical topology data. CLF-ULP incorporates graph attention networks to extract topological features within each layer and perform a cross-layer attention fusion to capture inter-layer dependencies. Furthermore, a shared-parameter long short-term memory network is employed to model the temporal evolution of each layer. To improve embedding quality and link prediction performance, we develop a joint loss function that considers both intra-layer and inter-layer UAV adjacency. Extensive experiments on simulated UAV datasets under diverse mobility patterns demonstrate that CLF-ULP achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting links within dynamic multiplex UAV networks.

Abstract: Mobile data collection using controllable sinks is an effective approach to improve energy efficiency and data freshness in densely deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, existing path-planning methods are often heuristic-driven and lack the flexibility to adapt to high-level operational objectives under dynamic network conditions. In this paper, we propose ID2P2, a intent-driven diffusion-based path planning framework for jointly addresses rendezvous point selection and mobile data collector (MDC) tour construction in IoT-enabled dense WSNs. High-level intents, such as latency minimization, energy balancing, or coverage prioritization, are explicitly modeled and incorporated into a generative diffusion planning process that produces feasible and adaptive data collection trajectories. The proposed approach learns a trajectory prior that captures spatial node distribution and network characteristics, enabling the MDC to generate paths that align with specified intents while maintaining collision-free and energy-aware operation. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework against conventional path-planning baselines. The results demonstrate that ID2P2 consistently outperforms representative baselines, achieving up to 25-30% reduction in tour completion time and travel overhead, approximately 10-30% improvement in data freshness, and 15-30% gains in energy efficiency and packet delivery performance, while maintaining higher throughput and fairness as network density increases, confirming its robustness and scalability for WSNs.

Abstract: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is an information-theoretical approach used in 5G networks to improve spectral efficiency, but it is prone to interference during handovers. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that combines Gold-Walsh modulated sequences with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to intelligently manage interference during NOMA handovers. This method optimizes sequence selection and power allocation dynamically. As a result, it achieves a 95.2\% handover success rate, which is an improvement of up to 23.1 percentage points. It also delivers up to 28\% throughput gain and reduces interference by up to 41\% in various mobility scenarios. All improvements are statistically significant (\(p < 0.001\)). The DQN trains in \(4{,}200 \pm 400\) episodes with a complexity of \(O(N \log N + d \cdot h + \log B)\) and can be deployed in real-time.

Abstract: Telecommunication networks experience complex failures such as fiber cuts, traffic overloads, and cascading outages. Existing monitoring and digital twin systems are largely reactive, detecting failures only after service degradation occurs. We propose Adversarial Network Imagination, a closed-loop framework that integrates a Causal Large Language Model (LLM), a Knowledge Graph, and a Digital Twin to proactively generate, simulate, and evaluate adversarial network failures. The Causal LLM produces structured failure scenarios grounded in network dependencies encoded in the Knowledge Graph. These scenarios are executed within a Digital Twin to measure performance degradation and evaluate mitigation strategies. By iteratively refining scenarios based on simulation feedback, the framework shifts network operations from reactive troubleshooting toward anticipatory resilience analysis.

Method: 结合CNN频谱分类和混合感知优先、授权尽快的工作流程，在海上船只上部署私有5G堆栈，实现频谱感知和视频增强。

Result: 在巴巴多斯的实地实验中，SIDSense在模拟PAWS中断期间保持连接，频谱感知准确率达94.2%，平均决策延迟23毫秒，且5G L1零延迟。

Conclusion: SIDSense框架通过边缘AI技术实现了无数据库的TVWS操作，为气候脆弱地区提供了弹性连接解决方案，并计划开源部分组件以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are disproportionately exposed to climate-driven disasters, yet often rely on fragile terrestrial networks that fail when they are most needed. TV White Space (TVWS) links offer long-range, low-power coverage; however, current deployments depend on Protocol to Access White Spaces (PAWS) database connectivity for channel authorization, creating a single point of failure during outages.
  We present SIDSense, an edge AI framework for database-free TVWS operation that preserves regulatory intent through a compliance-gated controller, audit logging, and graceful degradation. SIDSense couples CNN-based spectrum classification with a hybrid sensing-first, authorization-as-soon-as-possible workflow and co-locates sensing and video enhancement with a private 5G stack on a maritime vessel to sustain situational-awareness video backhaul.
  Field experiments in Barbados demonstrate sustained connectivity during simulated PAWS outages, achieving 94.2% sensing accuracy over 470-698 MHz with 23 ms mean decision latency, while maintaining zero missed 5G Layer-1 (L1) deadlines under GPU-aware scheduling. We release an empirical Caribbean TVWS propagation and occupancy dataset and look to contribute some of the components of the SIDSense pipeline to the open source community to accelerate resilient connectivity deployments in climate-vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Because wireless communication is dynamic and has inherent defects, routing algorithms are crucial in the quickly evolving field of mobile ad hoc networks, or MANETs This study looks at the many security problems that MANETs encounter. These problems, which pose major risks to network performance, include flooding, sinkholes, and black hole assaults to address these challenges. We introduce the Hybrid Secure Routing Protocol (HSRP), which enhances the security and robustness of routing operations by fusing trust-based tactics with cryptographic approaches. HSRP combines the strengths of both proactive and reactive routing strategies, enabling it to adapt dynamically to evolving network conditions while protecting against malicious activities. We use extensive simulations with Network Simulator (NS-2) and a thorough review of the literature to assess HSRP's performance under different attack scenarios. The results show that, in comparison to traditional protocols, HSRP increases throughput and decreases latency, hence improving routing efficiency while simultaneously bolstering data transfer security. With uses in vital domains including military operations and disaster response, this study provides a scalable and workable approach for safe routing in MANETs. The findings highlight how crucial it is to include cutting-edge security features in routing protocol design to guarantee the dependability and integrity of MANETs in practical situations.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的动态Gold代码分配方案，优化吞吐量、能效和公平性，在智慧城市中表现良好，但在工业环境中需进一步改进。

Motivation: 超密集物联网网络需要有效的非正交多址接入（NOMA）方案，但由于固定代码分配导致强烈干扰。

Method: 提出了两种强化学习算法：自然策略梯度（NPG）用于学习稳定的离散动作，以及深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）用于连续代码嵌入。

Result: 在智慧城市条件下，NPG可实现11.6%的吞吐量和15.8%的能效提升，优于静态分配；但在工业环境中性能较差，可靠性较低（0-2%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模物联网网络中基于强化学习的资源分配提供了基础，但动态代码分配在超可靠物联网中不足，需结合功率控制或重传方案。

Abstract: Ultra-dense IoT networks require an effective non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, yet they experience intense interference because of fixed code assignment. We suggest a reinforcement learning (RL) model of dynamic Gold code assignment in IoT-NOMA networks. Our Markov Decision Process which is IoT aware is a joint optimization of throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness. Two RL algorithms are created, including Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) to learn stable discrete actions and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with continuous code embedding. Under smart city conditions, NPG can attain throughput of 11.6% and energy efficiency of 15.8 likewise superior to its performance with a static allocation. Nonetheless, the performance is worse in organized industrial settings, and the reliability is minimal (0-2%), which points to the fact that dynamic code assignment is not a sufficient measure of ultra-reliable IoT and needs to be supplemented by power control or retransmission schemes. The work offers a basis to the RL-based resource allocation in massive IoT network.

Abstract: The collaboration of large artificial intelligence (AI) models in mobile edge networks has emerged as a promising paradigm to meet the growing demand for intelligent services at the network edge. By enabling multiple devices to cooperatively execute submodels or subtasks, collaborative AI enhances inference efficiency and service quality with constrained resources. However, deploying large AI models in such environments remains challenging due to the intrinsic mismatch between model complexity and the limited computation, memory, and communication resources in edge networks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture for collaborative AI in mobile edge networks, along with representative application scenarios in transportation and healthcare. We further present recent advances in resource-efficient collaboration techniques, categorized into spatial and temporal approaches. The major spatial approaches include federated tuning, mixture of experts, patch-based diffusion, and hierarchical diffusion. Meanwhile, the important temporal approaches encompass split learning, cascading inference, speculative decoding, and routing inference. Building upon these foundations, we propose a multi-stage diffusion framework that enables elastic distribution of large generative models across heterogeneous edge resources. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance improvement in both efficiency and adaptability for data generation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown significant promise in wireless systems, enabling dynamic spectrum allocation, traffic management, and large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) coordination. However, their deployment in mission-critical applications introduces the risk of unsafe emergent behaviors, such as UAV collisions, denial-of-service events, or instability in vehicular networks. Existing safety mechanisms are predominantly reactive, relying on anomaly detection or fallback controllers that intervene only after unsafe actions occur, which cannot guarantee reliability in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) settings. In this work, we propose a proactive safety-constrained RL framework that integrates proof-carrying control (PCC) with empowerment-budgeted (EB) enforcement. Each agent action is verified through lightweight mathematical certificates to ensure compliance with interference constraints, while empowerment budgets regulate the frequency of safety overrides to balance safety and autonomy. We implement this framework on a wireless uplink scheduling task using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PCC+EB controller eliminates unsafe transmissions while preserving system throughput and predictable autonomy. Compared with unconstrained and reactive baselines, our method achieves provable safety guarantees with minimal performance degradation. These results highlight the potential of proactive safety constrained RL to enable trustworthy wireless autonomy in future 6G networks.

Abstract: Enhancing future wireless networks presents a significant challenge for networking systems due to diverse user demands and the emergence of 6G technology. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework, it often encounters difficulties with high-dimensional state spaces and complex environments, leading to substantial computational demands, distributed intelligence, and potentially inconsistent outcomes. Large language models (LLMs), with their extensive pretrained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, offer promising tools to enhance RL in optimizing 6G wireless networks. We explore RL models augmented by LLMs, emphasizing their roles and the potential benefits of their synergy in wireless network optimization. We then examine LLM-enabled RL across various protocol layers: physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers. Additionally, we propose an LLM-assisted state representation and semantic extraction to enhance the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. This approach is applied to service migration and request routing, as well as topology graph generation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-satellite networks. Through case studies, we demonstrate that our framework effectively performs optimization of wireless network. Finally, we outline prospective research directions for LLM-enabled RL in wireless network optimization.

Conclusion: MA-DHRL-OM通过多智能体深度分层强化学习方法，有效解决了传统覆盖组播在动态流量适应性和多目标优化上的问题，显著提升了延迟、带宽利用率和丢包率等性能指标。

Abstract: Compared with IP multicast, Overlay Multicast (OM) offers better compatibility and flexible deployment in heterogeneous, cross-domain networks. However, traditional OM struggles to adapt to dynamic traffic due to unawareness of physical resource states, and existing reinforcement learning methods fail to decouple OM's tightly coupled multi-objective nature, leading to high complexity, slow convergence, and instability. To address this, we propose MA-DHRL-OM, a multi-agent deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Using SDN's global view, it builds a traffic-aware model for OM path planning. The method decomposes OM tree construction into two stages via hierarchical agents, reducing action space and improving convergence stability. Multi-agent collaboration balances multi-objective optimization while enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments show MA-DHRL-OM outperforms existing methods in delay, bandwidth utilization, and packet loss, with more stable convergence and flexible routing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of network latency, jitter, and packet loss in cloud-based machine learning for visual neuroprostheses, ensuring temporal consistency of neural stimulus.

Method: The research employs a network-adaptive cloud-assisted pipeline using real-time RTT feedback to dynamically adjust image resolution, compression, and transmission rate. A Raspberry Pi 4 simulates a VPU in a client-server setup, tested across various wireless network conditions.

Result: Adaptive visual encoding significantly reduces end-to-end latency during network congestion, with moderate degradation of global scene structure but sharper decline in boundary precision.

Conclusion: The study identifies viable operating regimes for cloud-assisted preprocessing in visual neuroprostheses, emphasizing the need for network-aware adaptation to maintain perceptual stability.

Abstract: Cloud-based machine learning is increasingly explored as a preprocessing strategy for next-generation visual neuroprostheses, where advanced scene understanding may exceed the computational and energy constraints of battery-powered visual processing units (VPUs). Offloading computation to remote servers enables the use of state-of-the-art vision models, but also introduces sensitivity to network latency, jitter, and packet loss, which can disrupt the temporal consistency of the delivered neural stimulus. In this work, we examine the feasibility of cloud-assisted visual preprocessing for artificial vision by framing remote inference as a perceptually constrained systems problem. We present a network-adaptive cloud-assisted pipeline in which real-time round-trip-time (RTT) feedback is used to dynamically modulate image resolution, compression, and transmission rate, explicitly prioritizing temporal continuity under adverse network conditions. Using a Raspberry Pi 4 as a simulated VPU and a client-server architecture, we evaluate system performance across a range of realistic wireless network regimes. Results show that adaptive visual encoding substantially reduces end-to-end latency during network congestion, with only modest degradation of global scene structure, while boundary precision degrades more sharply. Together, these findings delineate operating regimes in which cloud-assisted preprocessing may remain viable for future visual neuroprostheses and underscore the importance of network-aware adaptation for maintaining perceptual stability.

Abstract: 6G networks are expected to be AI-native, intent-driven, and economically programmable, requiring fundamentally new approaches to network slice orchestration. Existing slicing frameworks, largely designed for 5G, rely on static policies and manual workflows and are ill-suited for the dynamic, multi-domain, and service-centric nature of emerging 6G environments. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI control plane architecture for 6G network slice orchestration, monitoring, and trading that treats orchestration as a holistic control function encompassing slice planning, deployment, continuous monitoring, and economically informed decision-making. The proposed control plane is realized as a layered architecture in which multiple cooperating AI agents. To support flexible and on-demand slice utilization, the control plane incorporates market-aware orchestration capabilities, allowing slice requirements, pricing, and availability to be jointly considered during orchestration decisions. A natural language interface, implemented using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enables users and applications to interact with control-plane functions through intent-based queries while enforcing safety and policy constraints. To ensure responsible and explainable autonomy, the control plane integrates fine-tuned large language models organized as a multi-model consortium, governed by a dedicated reasoning model. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-world testbed with multiple mobile core instances (e.g Open5GS) integrated with Ericsson's RAN infrastructure. The results demonstrate that combining agentic autonomy, closed-loop SLA assurance, market-aware orchestration, and natural language control enables a scalable and adaptive 6G-native control plane for network slice management, highlighting the potential of agentic AI as a foundational mechanism for future 6G networks.

Abstract: As 5G networks continue to evolve to deliver high speed, low latency, and reliable communications, ensuring uninterrupted service has become increasingly critical. While millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies enable gigabit data rates, they are highly susceptible to environmental factors, often leading to radio link failures (RLF). Predictive models leveraging radio and weather data have been proposed to address this issue; however, many operate as black boxes, offering limited transparency for operational deployment. This work bridges that gap by introducing a framework that combines explainability based feature pruning with model refinement. Our framework can be integrated into state of the art predictors such as GNN Transformer and LSTM based architectures for RLF prediction, enabling the development of accurate and explainability guided models in 5G networks. It provides insights into the contribution of input features and the decision making logic of neural networks, leading to lighter and more scalable models. When applied to RLF prediction, our framework unveils that weather data contributes minimally to the forecast in extensive real world datasets, which informs the design of a leaner model with 50 percent fewer parameters and improved F1 scores with respect to the state of the art solution. Ultimately, this work empowers network providers to evaluate and refine their neural network based prediction models for better interpretability, scalability, and performance.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as a powerful wave-domain technology that enables multi-stage manipulation of electromagnetic signals through multilayer programmable architectures. While SIMs offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for enhancing physical-layer security, their extremely large number of meta-atoms leads to a high-dimensional and strongly coupled optimization space, making conventional design approaches inefficient and difficult to scale. Moreover, existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dynamic wireless environments with imperfect knowledge of passive eavesdroppers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid quantum proximal policy optimization (Q-PPO) framework for SIM-assisted secure communications, which jointly optimizes transmit power allocation and SIM phase shifts to maximize the average secrecy rate under power and quality-of-service constraints. Specifically, a parameterized quantum circuit is embedded into the actor network, forming a hybrid classical-quantum policy architecture that enhances policy representation capability and exploration efficiency in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-PPO scheme consistently outperforms DRL baselines, achieving approximately 15% higher secrecy rates and 30% faster convergence under imperfect eavesdropper channel state information. These results establish Q-PPO as a powerful optimization paradigm for SIM-enabled secure wireless networks.

Abstract: Wireless communication is evolving into an agent era, where numerous intelligent agents equipped with perception, reasoning, and interaction capabilities will operate in highly dynamic wireless environments. To complete diverse complex tasks, agent communication will play a critical role, which enables autonomous information exchange with external tools, services, and other agents.

Abstract: As Internet of Things (IoT) systems scale and device heterogeneity grows, multimodal data have become ubiquitous. Meanwhile, evaluating the freshness of multimodal data is essential, as stale updates would delay task execution, degrade decision accuracy, and undermine safety in latency-sensitive services. However, existing freshness metrics such as Age of Information (AoI) are not suitable for multimodal data, as they do not capture modality-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a metric, namely, Modality-Tailored Age of Information (MAoI), to provide a unified and decision-relevant evaluation of freshness for resource management and policy optimization for multimodal data. This metric integrates modality-specific semantic and temporal characteristics, reflecting both age evolution and content importance for multimodal data in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. Then, the closed-form expression of the average MAoI is derived, and an MAoI minimization problem is formulated, where sampling intervals and offloading decisions are optimized with practical energy constraints. To effectively solve this problem, a Joint Sampling Offloading Optimization (JSO) algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the sampling intervals and offloading decisions. It is a block coordinate descent-based algorithm where an optimal sampling-interval subalgorithm is used to update the sampling intervals, and an interference-aware best-response offloading subalgorithm is proposed to update the offloading decisions alternately. Finally, a comprehensive simulation is performed, confirming that the MAoI metric effectively quantifies multimodal freshness compared to traditional AoI, and the JSO algorithm significantly minimizes the average MAoI compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: With rapid expansion of cellular networks and the proliferation of mobile devices, cellular traffic data exhibits complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations, posing challenges to accurate traffic prediction. Previous methods often focus predominantly on temporal modeling or depend on predefined spatial topologies, which limits their ability to jointly model spatio-temporal dependencies and effectively capture periodic patterns in cellular traffic. To address these issues, we propose a cellular traffic prediction framework that integrates spatio-temporal modeling with time-frequency analysis. First, we construct a spatial modeling branch to capture inter-cell dependencies through an attention mechanism, minimizing the reliance on predefined topological structures. Second, we build a time-frequency modeling branch to enhance the representation of periodic patterns. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive-scale LogCosh loss function, which adjusts the error penalty based on traffic magnitude, preventing large errors from dominating the training process and helping the model maintain relatively stable prediction accuracy across different traffic intensities. Experiments on three open-sourced datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves prediction performance superior to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is important for keeping cloud systems reliable and stable. Deep learning has improved time-series anomaly detection, but most models are evaluated on one dataset at a time. This raises questions about whether these models can handle different types of telemetry, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional environments.
  In this study, we evaluate four deep learning models, GRU, TCN, Transformer, and TSMixer. We also include Isolation Forest as a classical baseline. The models are tested across four telemetry datasets: the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark, Microsoft Cloud Monitoring dataset, Exathlon dataset, and IBM Console dataset. These datasets differ in structure, dimensionality, and labelling strategy. They include univariate time series, synthetic multivariate workloads, and real-world production telemetry with over 100,000 features.
  We use a unified training and evaluation pipeline across all datasets. The evaluation includes NAB-style metrics to capture early detection behaviour for datasets where anomalies persist over contiguous time intervals. This enables window-based scoring in settings where anomalies occur over contiguous time intervals, even when labels are recorded at the point level. The unified setup enables consistent analysis of model behaviour under shared scoring and calibration assumptions.
  Our results demonstrate that anomaly detection performance in cloud systems is governed not only by model architecture, but critically by calibration stability and feature-space geometry. By releasing our preprocessing pipelines, benchmark configuration, and evaluation artifacts, we aim to support reproducible and deployment-aware evaluation of anomaly detection systems for cloud environments.

Abstract: Effective management and operational decision-making for complex mobile network systems present significant challenges, particularly when addressing conflicting requirements such as efficiency, user satisfaction, and energy-efficient traffic steering. The literature presents various approaches aimed at enhancing network management, including the Zero-Touch Network (ZTN) and Self-Organizing Network (SON); however, these approaches often lack a practical and scalable mechanism to consider human sustainability goals as input, translate them into energy-aware operational policies, and enforce them at runtime. In this study, we address this gap by proposing the AGORA: Agentic Green Orchestration Architecture for Beyond 5G Networks. AGORA embeds a local tool-augmented Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the mobile network control loop to translate natural-language sustainability goals into telemetry-grounded actions, actuating the User Plane Function (UPF) to perform energy-aware traffic steering. The findings indicate a strong latency-energy coupling in tool-driven control loops and demonstrate that compact models can achieve a low energy footprint while still facilitating correct policy execution, including non-zero migration behavior under stressed Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) conditions. Our approach paves the way for sustainability-first, intent-driven network operations that align human objectives with executable orchestration in Beyond-5G infrastructures.

Motivation: 解决基站决策间的复杂耦合问题，传统启发式方法短视且深度强化学习在动态环境下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：首先通过监督微调（SFT）学习语法和初始化，随后通过组相对策略优化（GRPO）进行对齐，后者采用‘机会感知’奖励机制。

Result: 在相同请求轨迹下，协调器接近穷举搜索性能（5基站场景下0.610 vs. 0.617），优于经典基线（如LFU提升4.1%），并在不同缓存容量、库大小和用户密度下展示零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的多基站协调器在边缘缓存中表现出色，接近穷举搜索性能，并展示了强大的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Cooperative edge caching in overlapping zones creates intricate coupling among Base Station (BS) decisions, making content replacement highly sensitive to topology and temporal reuse. While heuristics are often myopic and Deep Reinforcement Learning lacks robustness under dynamics, this paper proposes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-BS orchestrator. The LLM acts as the sole autonomous engine, interacting with the environment via a validated text-to-action interface. Each time slot, the system renders environmental states -- including cache inventories and frequency statistics -- into prompts, parsing LLM-generated decisions against strict feasibility constraints. We align the model through a two-stage paradigm: Supervised Fine-Tuning on oracle trajectories for syntax and initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization. The latter employs an ``opportunity-aware'' reward that prioritizes multi-step cooperative gains relative to a No-Operation baseline. Evaluated on identical request traces, the orchestrator approaches exhaustive-search performance (0.610 vs.\ 0.617 in a 5-BS scenario), outperforms classical baselines (e.g., +4.1\% over least-frequently used), and demonstrates robust zero-shot transfer across varying cache capacities, library sizes, and user densities.

Conclusion: RFAS算法在易受阻塞的环境中显著优于基线方法，保持了95%以上的数据包传递率，严格保证了队列稳定性，并在高频流量场景中减少了19%的网络负载不平衡。

Abstract: In industrial millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-hop Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) networks, dynamic blockages caused by moving obstacles pose a severe threat to robust and continuous networks. While Packet Duplication (PD) enhances reliability by path diversity, it inevitably doubles the traffic load, leading to severe congestion and degraded Age of Information (AoI). To navigate this reliability-congestion trade-off, we formulated an optimization problem in a multi-hop IAB scenario that minimizes the average AOI while satisfying strict queue stability constraints. We utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform the long-term stochastic optimization problem into tractable deterministic sub-problems. To solve these sub-problems efficiently, we propose a Resilient and Freshness-Aware Scheduling (RFAS) algorithm. Simulation results show that in blockage-prone environments, RFAS significantly outperforms baselines by maintaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) above 95\%. Crucially, it strictly guarantees queue stability under hard buffer constraints, whereas baselines suffer from buffer overflows. Furthermore, RFAS reduces the network load imbalance by 19\% compared to the baseline in high-frequency traffic scenarios. This confirms RFAS as a robust and sustainable solution for real-time industrial control loops.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware waveform design framework for AI-native 6G networks that jointly optimizes physical layer resource usage and semantic communication efficiency and robustness, while explicitly accounting for the hardware constraints of RF chains. Our approach, called Orthogonal Semantic Sequency Division Multiplexing (OSSDM), introduces a parametrizable, orthogonal-base waveform design that enables controlled degradation of the wireless transmitted signal to preserve semantically significant content while minimizing resource consumption. We demonstrate that OSSDM not only reinforces semantic robustness against channel impairments but also improves semantic spectral efficiency by encoding meaningful information directly at the waveform level. Extensive numerical evaluations show that OSSDM outperforms conventional OFDM waveforms in spectral efficiency and semantic fidelity. The proposed semantic waveform co-design opens new research frontiers for AI-native, intelligent communication systems by enabling meaning-aware physical signal construction through the direct encoding of semantics at the waveform level.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of indoor wireless signal propagation is crucial for the deployment of next-generation Wi-Fi. This paper presents a digital twin-based measurement system that integrates real-world 3D environment reconstruction with deterministic ray tracing for physically grounded electromagnetic modeling. Building geometry is obtained through LiDAR scanning, followed by object segmentation and assignment of ITU-R standard material parameters. The propagation process is simulated with a GPU-accelerated ray-tracing engine that generates path-level channel attributes, including delay, power, angular dispersion, and Ricean K-factor. Under identical runtime constraints, the proposed system is evaluated against a commercial measurement simulator, demonstrating up to 21 dB higher path gain and consistently improved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in line-of-sight conditions. Additionally, experiments against onsite RSSI measurements confirm a high spatial correlation of 0.98 after calibration, proving the system's fidelity in real-world settings. Furthermore, coverage analysis across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands demonstrates the capability of system to model frequency-dependent material attenuation for Wi-Fi 6E/7 networks. Finally, the system offers interactive 3D visualization and on-demand data extraction, highlighting its potential for digital twin-driven wireless system design and optimization.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个参数化框架，将规划连接视为一等转换，通过高效候选过滤扩展到大型图，并使用多维标准来决定是否继续探索或放弃遍历。

Abstract: Classical path search assumes complete graphs and scalar optimization metrics, yet real infrastructure networks are incomplete and require multi-dimensional evaluation. We introduce the concept of traversal: a generalization of paths that combines existing edges with gap transitions, missing but acceptable connections representing links that can be built. This abstraction captures how engineers actually reason about infrastructure: not just what exists, but what can be realized.
  We present a parametric framework that treats planned connections as first-class transitions, scales to large graphs through efficient candidate filtering, and uses multi-dimensional criteria to decide whether a traversal should continue to be explored or be abandoned. We evaluate the framework through representative scenarios in datacenter circuit design and optical route construction in telecommunication networks, demonstrating conditional feasibility, non-scalarizable trade-offs, and policy calibration capabilities beyond the reach of classical formulations.

Conclusion: 提出的时空特征对齐和加权融合框架显著提升了车联网（IoV）中的协作感知精度，特别是在存在时钟漂移和链路延迟的情况下。

Abstract: Collaborative perception in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aggregates multi-vehicle observations for broader scene coverage and improved decision-making. However, fusion quality degrades under spatiotemporal heterogeneity from unsynchronized clocks, communication delays, and motion variations across vehicles. Prior work mitigates these through spatial transformations or fixed time-offset corrections, overlooking time-varying clock drifts and delays that cause persistent feature misalignment. To overcome these, we propose a spatiotemporal feature alignment and weighted fusion framework. Specifically, network synchronization is designed to continuously compensate for clock state differences between vehicles and establish a common time reference, onto which all feature timestamps can be mapped. After synchronization, to align the freshness of received features since their generation, their Age of Information (AoI) is determined by estimating network delay with given feature size and link quality. Our spatiotemporal feature alignment then projects vehicles' features into one spatial coordinate and corrects them to a synchronized fusion instant using AoIs, enabling all features to describe the scene coherently. Furthermore, due to varying synchronization and alignment quality, we estimate their uncertainties and integrate with AoI to generate feature weights for efficient fusion, prioritizing fresh, reliable feature regions. Simulations show consistent perception accuracy improvements over strong baselines under clock drifts and link delays.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的多模态传感与融合学习框架显著减少了毫米波通信中的波束训练开销，提高了通信效率，并在多种实际场景中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, utilizing beamforming techniques to address the inherent path loss limitation, is considered as one of the key technologies to support ever increasing high throughput and low latency demands of connected vehicles. However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach.

Conclusion: PASAR框架通过参数敏感性感知的重传机制，显著提高了边缘AI模型下载的通信效率和延迟性能。

Abstract: The edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications in next-generation mobile networks demand efficient AI-model downloading techniques to support real-time, on-device inference. However, transmitting high-dimensional AI models over wireless channels remains challenging due to limited communication resources. To address this issue, we propose a parametric-sensitivity-aware retransmission (PASAR) framework that manages radio-resource usage of different parameter packets according to their importance on model inference accuracy, known as parametric sensitivity. Empirical analysis reveals a highly right-skewed sensitivity distribution, indicating that only a small fraction of parameters significantly affect model performance. Leveraging this insight, we design a novel online retransmission protocol, i.e., the PASAR protocol, that adaptively terminates packet transmission based on real-time bit error rate (BER) measurements and the associated parametric sensitivity. The protocol employs an adaptive, round-wise stopping criterion, enabling heterogeneous, packet-level retransmissions that preserve overall model functionality but reduce overall latency. Extensive experiments across diverse deep neural network architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that PASAR substantially outperforms classical hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) schemes in terms of communication efficiency and latency.

Abstract: This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.

Conclusion: LEAD-Drift 是一个高效、可解释且操作简便的解决方案，显著提升了意图漂移的实时检测能力，为 IBN 提供了主动的网络保障。

Abstract: Intent-Based Networking (IBN) simplifies network management, but its reliability is challenged by "intent drift", where the network's state gradually deviates from its intended goal, often leading to silent failures. Conventional approaches struggle to detect the subtle, early stages of intent drift, raising alarms only when degradation is significant and failure is imminent, which limits their effectiveness for proactive assurance. To address this, we propose LEAD-Drift, a framework that detects intent drift in real time to enable proactive failure prevention. LEAD-Drift's core contribution is reformulating intent failure detection as a supervised learning problem by training a lightweight neural network on fixed-horizon labels to predict a future risk score. The model's raw output is then smoothed with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and passed through a statistically tuned threshold to generate robust, real-time alerts. Furthermore, we enhance the framework with two key features for operational intelligence: a multi-horizon modeling technique for dynamic time-to-failure estimation, and per-alert explainability using SHAP to identify root-cause KPIs. Our evaluation on a time-series dataset shows LEAD-Drift provides significantly earlier warnings, improving the average lead time by 7.3 minutes (+17.8\%) compared to a distance-based baseline. It also reduces alert noise by 80.2\% compared to a weighted-KPI heuristic, with only a minor trade-off in lead time. These results demonstrate that LEAD-Drift as a highly effective, interpretable, and operationally efficient solution for proactive network assurance in IBN.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating the shift from an Internet of information to an Internet of Agents (IoA), where autonomous entities discover services, negotiate, execute tasks, and exchange value. Yet today's agents are still confined to platform silos and proprietary interfaces, lacking a common stack for interoperability, trust, and pay-per-use settlement. This article proposes \textit{Agent-OSI}, a six-layer reference stack for decentralized agent networking built on top of the existing Internet. Agent-OSI combines secure connectivity and A2A messaging, decentralized identity and authorization, settlement and metering, verifiable execution and provenance, and semantic interoperability for orchestration. In particular, we treat HTTP 402 (Payment Required) as an application-level payment challenge (analogous to HTTP 401 for authentication) that triggers escrow-based settlement and verifiable receipts (instantiated via a blockchain escrow in our prototype), rather than introducing a new network-layer protocol. We implement a prototype and evaluate cost and latency. Results show that keeping negotiation and delivery off-chain while preserving verifiable settlement reduces on-chain session costs by approximately 51\% compared with a standard Web3 baseline in our prototype setting, and that blockchain confirmation latency is often not the dominant factor for generative workloads.

*Udhaya Srinivasan,Weisi Guo*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于代理的网络管理器和回合制对话助手，用于解决AI-RAN中的分层动态问题，通过三层框架实现高效管理，初步验证显示其在降低运营成本方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新一代无线接入网络（RAN）尤其是原生AI服务的管理对实时人工操作提出了更高要求，而企业网络通常缺乏本地专业知识。现有研究主要关注RAG LLMs在RAN和核心网络规划配置方面的应用，而RAN与边缘AI的协同管理仍是空白。

Method: 论文构建了一个三层框架，包括用户界面和评估仪表板、与AI-RAN交互的智能层，以及提供评估和建议基础的知识层。

Result: 框架在以下方面表现出平均响应时间为13秒的验证性能：服务设计与规划（78%准确率）、特定AI-RAN工具操作（89%准确率）、AI-RAN性能调优（67%准确率）。

Conclusion: 该论文的初步结果表明，尽管存在幻觉等普遍挑战，但其快速响应性能能够有效降低中小型企业用户的运营成本。

Abstract: New generations of radio access networks (RAN), especially with native AI services are increasingly difficult for human engineers to manage in real-time. Enterprise networks are often managed locally, where expertise is scarce. Existing research has focused on creating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLMs that can help to plan and configure RAN and core aspects only. Co-management of RAN and edge AI is the gap, which creates hierarchical and dynamic problems that require turn-based human interactions. Here, we create an agentic network manager and turn-based conversation assistant that can understand human intent-based queries that match hierarchical problems in AI-RAN. The framework constructed consists of: (a) a user interface and evaluation dashboard, (b) an intelligence layer that interfaces with the AI-RAN, and (c) a knowledge layer for providing the basis for evaluations and recommendations. These form 3 layers of capability with the following validation performances (average response time 13s): (1) design and planning a service (78\% accuracy), (2) operating specific AI-RAN tools (89\% accuracy), and (3) tuning AI-RAN performance (67\%). These initial results indicate the universal challenges of hallucination but also fast response performance success that can really reduce OPEX costs for small scale enterprise users.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个多尺度代理AI框架，用于O-RAN，通过协调非实时、近实时和实时控制环中的代理，实现了灵活的网络管理和优化。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) promise flexible 6G network access through disaggregated, software-driven components and open interfaces, but this programmability also increases operational complexity. Multiple control loops coexist across the service management layer and RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), while independently developed control applications can interact in unintended ways. In parallel, recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling a shift from isolated AI models toward agentic AI systems that can interpret goals, coordinate multiple models and control functions, and adapt their behavior over time. This article proposes a multi-scale agentic AI framework for O-RAN that organizes RAN intelligence as a coordinated hierarchy across the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT), Near-Real-Time (Near-RT), and Real-Time (RT) control loops: (i) A Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the Non-RT RIC translates operator intent into policies and governs model lifecycles. (ii) Small Language Model (SLM) agents in the Near-RT RIC execute low-latency optimization and can activate, tune, or disable existing control applications; and (iii) Wireless Physical-layer Foundation Model (WPFM) agents near the distributed unit provide fast inference close to the air interface. We describe how these agents cooperate through standardized O-RAN interfaces and telemetry. Using a proof-of-concept implementation built on open-source models, software, and datasets, we demonstrate the proposed agentic approach in two representative scenarios: robust operation under non-stationary conditions and intent-driven slice resource control.

*Md. Kamrul Hossain,Walid Aljoby*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: MILD是一个主动预测框架，通过意图级消歧和风险评分，显著提升多意图网络中的故障修复效率和根因识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多意图网络中，单一故障可能引发多个意图的KPI退化（共漂移），导致根因意图模糊，需要一种主动的意图保障方法。

Method: MILD采用教师增强的Mixture-of-Experts架构，其中门控消歧模块识别根因意图，每个意图头输出校准的风险分数。

Result: 在非线性和共漂移故障的基准测试中，MILD比基线方法提供了3.8%--92.5%更长的修复提前时间，并将意图级根因消歧准确率提高了9.4%--45.8%。

Conclusion: MILD框架通过主动预测和意图级消歧，显著提高了故障修复的提前时间和根因意图识别的准确性，并提供可操作的诊断解释。

Abstract: In multi-intent intent-based networks, a single fault can trigger co-drift where multiple intents exhibit symptomatic KPI degradation, creating ambiguity about the true root-cause intent. We present MILD, a proactive framework that reformulates intent assurance from reactive drift detection to fixed-horizon failure prediction with intent-level disambiguation. MILD uses a teacher-augmented Mixture-of-Experts where a gated disambiguation module identifies the root-cause intent while per-intent heads output calibrated risk scores. On a benchmark with non-linear failures and co-drifts, MILD provides 3.8\%--92.5\% longer remediation lead time and improves intent-level root-cause disambiguation accuracy by 9.4\%--45.8\% over baselines. MILD also provides per-alert KPI explanations, enabling actionable diagnosis.

TL;DR: LiSFC是一种针对云计算网络融合的终身规划器，通过转移MCTS统计信息优化SFC性能，显著降低阻塞概率和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对5G/6G和计算能力网络（CPNs）中服务功能链（SFC）在长期拓扑/资源变化下的非静态图漂移问题，现有SFC优化器表现不佳。

Method: 提出LiSFC，一种基于Lipschitz终身规划器的解决方案，通过MDP距离界限在漂移网络配置间转移MCTS统计信息，并设计了SFC感知的统一MCTS（UMCTS）过程。

Result: 在合成CPN拓扑和SFC工作负载上的初步结果显示，LiSFC相比非转移MCTS和纯学习基线，持续降低了SFC阻塞概率并改善了尾部延迟。

Conclusion: LiSFC通过利用LiZero框架的理论保证，在云计算网络融合中显著降低了SFC阻塞概率并改善了尾部延迟，展示了其作为AI/ML构建块的潜力。

Abstract: Edge-cloud convergence is reshaping service provisioning across 5G/6G and computing power networks (CPNs). Service function chaining (SFC) requires continuously placing and scheduling virtual network functions (VNFs) chains under compute/bandwidth and end-to-end QoS constraints. Most SFC optimizers assume static or stationary networks, and degrade under long-term topology/resource changes (failures, upgrades, expansions) that induce non-stationary graph drifts. We propose LiSFC, a Lipschitz lifelong planner that transfers MCTS statistics across drifting network configurations using an MDP-distance bound. More precisely, we formulate the problem as a sequence of MDPs indexed by the underlying network graph and constraints, and we define a \emph{graph drift} metric that upper-bounds the LiZero MDP distance. This allows LiSFC to import theoretical guarantees on bias and sample efficiency from the LiZero framework while being tailored to cloud-network convergence. We then design \emph{LiSFC-Search}, an SFC-aware unified MCTS (UMCTS) procedure that uses transferable adaptive UCT (aUCT) bonuses to reuse search statistics from prior CPN configurations. Preliminary results on synthetic CPN topologies and SFC workloads show that LiSFC consistently reduces SFC blocking probability and improves tail delay compared to non-transfer MCTS and purely learning-based baselines, highlighting its potential as an AI/ML building block for cloud-network convergence.

Motivation: 研究比特币在物理基础设施故障下的韧性，揭示其去中心化设计中的隐藏依赖。

Method: 使用11年的P2P网络数据、658条海底电缆和68次已验证的电缆故障事件，结合Buldyrev级联模型和4层Tor中继模型进行分析。

Result: 比特币的清晰网络渗流阈值在随机电缆故障下为0.72-0.92，目标攻击下降至0.05-0.20；Tor的采用提升了韧性（Δpc≈+0.02-+0.10）。

Conclusion: 比特币的物理基础设施依赖性是隐藏的脆弱点，但Tor的采用通过分布式的带宽集中增强了其韧性。

Abstract: Bitcoin's design promises resilience through decentralization, yet physical infrastructure creates hidden dependencies. We present the first longitudinal study of Bitcoin's resilience to infrastructure failures using 11 years of P2P network data (2014-2025), 658 submarine cables, and 68 verified cable fault events. Using a Buldyrev-style cascade model with a country-level physical layer (225 countries, 354 submarine cable edges, 325 land border edges), we find that Bitcoin's clearnet percolation threshold $p_c \approx 0.72$-$0.92$ for random cable failures, declining 22% from $p_c \approx 0.92$ (2014-2017) to a minimum of $p_c = 0.72$ in 2021 during peak mining concentration. Targeted attacks reduce $p_c$ to 0.05-0.20. To address the 64% of nodes using Tor with unobservable locations, we develop a 4-layer multiplex model incorporating Tor relay infrastructure. Tor relay bandwidth concentrates in well-connected European countries, increasing resilience by $Δp_c \approx +0.02$-$+0.10$ rather than introducing fragility. Empirical validation shows 87% of cable faults caused less than 5% node impact. We contribute: (1) a multiplex percolation framework for overlay-underlay coupling with a 4-layer Tor relay model; (2) the first empirical measurement of Bitcoin's physical-layer resilience over a decade; and (3) evidence that Tor adoption amplifies resilience with distributional bounds under partial observability.

Abstract: In this paper, a method for predicting the resources required for an intelligent vehicle client using a three-layer vehicular computing architecture is proposed. This method leverages Q-Learning to optimize resource allocation and enhance overall system performance. This approach employs reinforcement learning capabilities to provide a dynamic and adaptive strategy for resource management in a fog computing environment. The key findings of this study indicate that Q-learning can effectively predict the appropriate allocation of resources by learning from past experiences and making informed decisions. Through continuous training and updating of the Q-learning agent, the system can adapt to changing conditions and make resource allocation decisions based on real-time information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing resource allocation. The Q-learning agent predicts the optimal values for memory, bandwidth, and processor. These predictions not only minimize resource consumption but also meet the performance requirements of the fog system. Implementations show that this method improves the average task processing time in compared to other methods evaluated in this study

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备异构性是联邦学习在分布式物联网设备中的主要挑战，因为设备在计算能力、内存和网络环境上存在显著差异。

Method: ASA框架通过智能代理层实时分析设备的CPU能力、内存和网络环境，将设备分为高性能、中端和低能力三个级别，并为每个级别定制适合其计算能力的模型。

Result: 在两个基准数据集（MNIST和CIFAR-10）上的实验表明，ASA减少了43%至50%的通信负担，提高了43%的资源利用率，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10上分别达到了98.89%和85.30%的模型准确率。

Conclusion: ASA框架通过自适应设备聚类和定制化模型，显著提升了异构联邦学习环境的效率、可扩展性和公平性，适用于现实世界的物联网应用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a promising answer to facilitating privacy-preserving collaborative learning in distributed IoT devices. However, device heterogeneity is a key challenge because IoT networks include devices with very different computational powers, memory availability, and network environments. To this end, we introduce ASA (Adaptive Smart Agent). This new framework clusters devices adaptively based on real-time resource profiles and adapts customized models suited to every cluster's capability. ASA capitalizes on an intelligent agent layer that examines CPU power, available memory, and network environment to categorize devices into three levels: high-performance, mid-tier, and low-capability. Each level is provided with a model tuned to its computational power to ensure inclusive engagement across the network. Experimental evaluation on two benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10, proves that ASA decreases communication burden by 43% to 50%, improves resource utilization by 43%, and achieves final model accuracies of 98.89% on MNIST and 85.30% on CIFAR-10. These results highlight ASA's efficacy in enhancing efficiency, scalability, and fairness in heterogeneous FL environments, rendering it a suitable answer for real-world IoT apps.

Motivation: 研究多无人机系统在执行高层任务时如何保持物理层的正式鲁棒性保证。

Result: 提出了理论保证，描述了在有界扰动和由LLM更新引起的离散跳跃的分段平滑参考下的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何将基于语言的集中式任务推理与分布式反馈控制相结合，以实现具有可证明鲁棒性和稳定性的复杂行为。

Abstract: We study language-in-the-loop control for multi-drone systems that execute evolving, high-level missions while retaining formal robustness guarantees at the physical layer. We propose a three-layer architecture in which (i) a human operator issues natural-language instructions, (ii) an LLM-based supervisor periodically interprets, verifies, and corrects the commanded task in the context of the latest state and target estimates, and (iii) a distributed inner-loop controller tracks the resulting reference using only local relative information. We derive a theoretical guarantee that characterizes tracking performance under bounded disturbances and piecewise-smooth references with discrete jumps induced by LLM updates. Overall, our results illustrate how centralized language-based task reasoning can be combined with distributed feedback control to achieve complex behaviors with provable robustness and stability.

Motivation: 现有交互系统多为反应式，缺乏主动社交行为，而主动行为需要长时间上下文推理，与实时交互的延迟预算冲突。

Method: 提出了ProAct双系统框架，包括低延迟的行为系统和高延迟的认知系统，并引入流式流匹配模型实现意图的无缝注入。

Result: 在真实交互用户研究中，ProAct在主动性、社交存在感和整体参与度上优于反应式变体。

Conclusion: ProAct框架通过双系统设计成功解决了实时交互中的延迟冲突，提升了社交机器人的主动性和互动效果。

Abstract: Embodied social agents have recently advanced in generating synchronized speech and gestures. However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction.

Conclusion: DORA框架通过显式数据依赖规范和高效的零拷贝数据传输，显著降低了延迟和CPU开销，优于现有中间件。

Abstract: Robotic middleware serves as the foundational infrastructure, enabling complex robotic systems to operate in a coordinated and modular manner. In data-intensive robotic applications, especially in industrial scenarios, communication efficiency directly impact system responsiveness, stability, and overall productivity. However, existing robotic middleware exhibit several limitations: (1) they rely heavily on (de)serialization mechanisms, introducing significant overhead for large-sized data; (2) they lack efficient and flexible support for heterogeneous data sizes, particularly in intra-robot communication and Python-based execution environments. To address these challenges, we propose Dataflow-Oriented Robotic Architecture (DORA) that enables explicit data dependency specification and efficient zero-copy data transmission. We implement the proposed framework as an open-source system and evaluate it through extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in latency and CPU overhead compared to state-of-the-art middleware.

Abstract: Mechanically characterizing the human-machine interface is essential to understanding user behavior and optimizing wearable robot performance. This interface has been challenging to sensorize due to manufacturing complexity and non-linear sensor responses. Here, we measure human limb-device interaction via fluidic innervation, creating a 3D-printed silicone pad with embedded air channels to measure forces. As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered. Pad pressure tracked squat phase and overall task dynamics consistently. Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction. In the long-term, this modality may provide an alternative real-time sensing input to control / optimize wearable robotic systems and to capture user function during device use.

Conclusion: FlowHOI 通过两阶段流匹配框架有效生成了语义基础、时间连贯的手-物体交互序列，显著提升了长时程、接触密集任务的表现，并在真实机器人执行中展示了可行性。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models can generate plausible end-effector motions, yet they often fail in long-horizon, contact-rich tasks because the underlying hand-object interaction (HOI) structure is not explicitly represented. An embodiment-agnostic interaction representation that captures this structure would make manipulation behaviors easier to validate and transfer across robots. We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\times$ inference speedup. We further demonstrate real-robot execution on four dexterous manipulation tasks, illustrating the feasibility of retargeting generated HOI representations to real-robot execution pipelines.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based framework for estimating pursuer parameters in turn-rate-limited pursuit-evasion scenarios using sacrificial agents. Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case.
  Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions.

In dynamic environments, this latency breaks the control loop, rendering powerful models unsafe for real-time deployment. We propose AsyncVLA, an asynchronous control framework that decouples semantic reasoning from reactive execution. Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics.

Motivation: 在存在感知噪声、定位不确定性和不完全语义感知的情况下，动态路径规划必须保持可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种基于占用网格和可选占用流预测的非线性程序，构建在改进的自行车模型上，具有显式可行性和避碰惩罚。

Conclusion: 该方法为噪声弹性和预测感知的路径规划提供了坚实基础，消除了对手工启发式方法的需求。

Abstract: Dynamic path planning must remain reliable in the presence of sensing noise, uncertain localization, and incomplete semantic perception. We propose a practical, implementation-friendly planner that operates on occupancy grids and optionally incorporates occupancy-flow predictions to generate ego-centric, kinematically feasible paths that safely navigate through static and dynamic obstacles. The core is a nonlinear program in the spatial domain built on a modified bicycle model with explicit feasibility and collision-avoidance penalties. The formulation naturally handles unknown obstacle classes and heterogeneous agent motion by operating purely in occupancy space. The pipeline runs in real-time (faster than 10 Hz on average), requires minimal tuning, and interfaces cleanly with standard control stacks. We validate our approach in simulation with severe localization and perception noises, and on an F1TENTH platform, demonstrating smooth and safe maneuvering through narrow passages and rough routes. The approach provides a robust foundation for noise-resilient, prediction-aware planning, eliminating the need for handcrafted heuristics.

TL;DR: TactAlign 是一种无需配对数据的跨体现触觉对齐方法，通过共享潜在表示和伪对传输，显著提升了人类到机器人策略转移的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过可穿戴设备（如触觉手套）收集的演示为策略学习提供了快速且灵巧的监督，但如何将人类收集的触觉信号转移到机器人上是一个关键挑战，尤其是在传感模式和体现存在差异的情况下。

Method: TactAlign 通过使用 rectified flow 将人类和机器人的触觉观察转换为共享的潜在表示，并利用手-物体交互衍生的伪对进行低成本潜在传输。

Result: TactAlign 在多个接触丰富的任务（如旋转、插入、盖子关闭）中改进了 H2R 策略转移，能够泛化到未见过的物体和任务（仅需不到 5 分钟的人类数据），并在高度灵巧的任务（如灯泡拧紧）中实现零样本 H2R 转移。

Conclusion: TactAlign 是一种跨体现触觉对齐方法，能够将人类收集的触觉信号转移到具有不同体现的机器人上，无需配对数据集、手动标签或特权信息，显著提高了人类到机器人（H2R）策略转移的效果。

Abstract: Human demonstrations collected by wearable devices (e.g., tactile gloves) provide fast and dexterous supervision for policy learning, and are guided by rich, natural tactile feedback. However, a key challenge is how to transfer human-collected tactile signals to robots despite the differences in sensing modalities and embodiment. Existing human-to-robot (H2R) approaches that incorporate touch often assume identical tactile sensors, require paired data, and involve little to no embodiment gap between human demonstrator and the robots, limiting scalability and generality. We propose TactAlign, a cross-embodiment tactile alignment method that transfers human-collected tactile signals to a robot with different embodiment. TactAlign transforms human and robot tactile observations into a shared latent representation using a rectified flow, without paired datasets, manual labels, or privileged information. Our method enables low-cost latent transport guided by hand-object interaction-derived pseudo-pairs. We demonstrate that TactAlign improves H2R policy transfer across multiple contact-rich tasks (pivoting, insertion, lid closing), generalizes to unseen objects and tasks with human data (less than 5 minutes), and enables zero-shot H2R transfer on a highly dexterous tasks (light bulb screwing).

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents have demonstrated significant capabilities in virtual environments, yet their integration with the physical world remains narrowly confined to direct control interfaces. We present AgentRob, a framework that bridges online community forums, LLM-powered agents, and physical robots through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentRob enables a novel paradigm where autonomous agents participate in online forums--reading posts, extracting natural language commands, dispatching physical robot actions, and reporting results back to the community. The system comprises three layers: a Forum Layer providing asynchronous, persistent, multi-agent interaction; an Agent Layer with forum agents that poll for @mention-targeted commands; and a Robot Layer with VLM-driven controllers and Unitree Go2/G1 hardware that translate commands into robot primitives via iterative tool calling. The framework supports multiple concurrent agents with distinct identities and physical embodiments coexisting in the same forum, establishing the feasibility of forum-mediated multi-agent robot orchestration.

Abstract: Existing robotic manipulation methods primarily rely on visual and proprioceptive observations, which may struggle to infer contact-related interaction states in partially observable real-world environments. Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: SPLIT框架通过模型分解、局部增量学习和GP稀疏化，显著提高了车辆模型的准确性和控制性能，并能快速适应动态偏差，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate, computationally efficient, and adaptive vehicle models are essential for autonomous vehicle control. Hybrid models that combine a nominal model with a Gaussian Process (GP)-based residual model have emerged as a promising approach. However, the GP-based residual model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, high evaluation complexity, and the inefficiency of online learning, which impede the deployment in real-time vehicle controllers. To address these challenges, we propose SPLIT, a sparse incremental learning framework for control-oriented vehicle dynamics modeling. SPLIT integrates three key innovations: (i) Model Decomposition. We decompose the vehicle model into invariant elements calibrated by experiments, and variant elements compensated by the residual model to reduce feature dimensionality. (ii) Local Incremental Learning. We define the valid region in the feature space and partition it into subregions, enabling efficient online learning from streaming data. (iii) GP Sparsification. We use bayesian committee machine to ensure scalable online evaluation. Integrated into model-based controllers, SPLIT is evaluated in aggressive simulations and real-vehicle experiments. Results demonstrate that SPLIT improves model accuracy and control performance online. Moreover, it enables rapid adaptation to vehicle dynamics deviations and exhibits robust generalization to previously unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Current humanoid motion tracking systems can execute routine and moderately dynamic behaviors, yet significant gaps remain near hardware performance limits and algorithmic robustness boundaries. Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios.

Method: 提出了一种跨模态Transformer（CMT），通过结构化的自注意力和跨注意力整合手腕摄像头观测与触觉信号，并引入物理信息正则化以稳定触觉嵌入。

Result: 在TacSL基准测试中，CMT结合对称正则化实现了96.59%的插入成功率，优于简单和门控融合基线，接近理想配置（96.09%）。

Conclusion: 触觉传感对于精确对齐不可或缺，而结合物理信息的正则化多模态融合方法能够充分发挥视觉和触觉的互补优势，接近理想传感条件下的性能。

Abstract: Insertion tasks in robotic manipulation demand precise, contact-rich interactions that vision alone cannot resolve. While tactile feedback is intuitively valuable, existing studies have shown that naïve visuo-tactile fusion often fails to deliver consistent improvements. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for visuo-tactile fusion that integrates wrist-camera observations with tactile signals through structured self- and cross-attention. To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged "wrist + contact force" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing.

Method: HybridFlow是一种3阶段方法，包含2-NFE：MeanFlow模式下的全局跳跃、用于分布对齐的ReNoise以及ReFlow模式下的局部细化。

Result: HybridFlow在真实实验中，成功率比16步扩散策略高出15-25%，推理时间从152ms降至19ms（8倍加速，约52Hz），并在未见颜色OOD抓取和可变形物体折叠中分别达到70.0%和66.3%的成功率。

Conclusion: HybridFlow作为一种实用的低延迟方法，能够显著提升机器人操作策略在现实世界中的交互能力。

Abstract: Limited by inference latency, existing robot manipulation policies lack sufficient real-time interaction capability with the environment. Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial scanning of target structures is crucial for practical applications, requiring online adaptation to unknown obstacles during flight. Existing methods largely emphasize collision avoidance and efficiency, but overlook occlusion-induced visibility degradation, severely compromising scanning quality. In this study, we propose FC-Vision, an on-the-fly visibility-aware replanning framework that proactively and safely prevents target occlusions while preserving the intended coverage and efficiency of the original plan. Our approach explicitly enforces dense surface-visibility constraints to regularize replanning behavior in real-time via an efficient two-level decomposition: occlusion-free viewpoint repair that maintains coverage with minimal deviation from the nominal scan intent, followed by segment-wise clean-sensing connection in 5-DoF space. A plug-in integration strategy is also presented to seamlessly interface FC-Vision with existing UAV scanning systems without architectural changes. Comprehensive simulation and real-world evaluations show that FC-Vision consistently improves scanning quality under unexpected occluders, delivering a maximum coverage gain of 55.32% and a 73.17% reduction in the occlusion ratio, while achieving real-time performance with a moderate increase in flight time. The source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: During the use of advanced driver assistance systems, drivers frequently intervene into the active driving function and adjust the system's behavior to their personal wishes. These active driver-initiated takeovers contain feedback about deviations in the driving function's behavior from the drivers' personal preferences. This feedback should be utilized to optimize and personalize the driving function's behavior. In this work, the adjustment of the speed profile of a Predictive Longitudinal Driving Function (PLDF) on a pre-defined route is highlighted. An algorithm is introduced which iteratively adjusts the PLDF's speed profile by taking into account both the original speed profile of the PLDF and the driver demonstration. This approach allows for personalization in a traded control scenario during active use of the PLDF. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is tested in a driving simulator-based test group study with 43 participants. The study finds a significant increase in driver satisfaction and a significant reduction in the intervention frequency when using the proposed adaptive PLDF. Additionally, feedback by the participants was gathered to identify further optimization potentials of the proposed system.

Conclusion: XIT算法不仅适用于主动气体分布映射（GDM），还可推广至其他需要在未知环境中平衡探索与利用的机器人信息收集任务。

Abstract: Mobile robotic gas distribution mapping (GDM) provides critical situational awareness during emergency responses to hazardous gas releases. However, most systems still rely on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed. Autonomous active GDM is challenging in unknown and cluttered environments, because the robot must simultaneously explore traversable space, map the environment, and infer the gas distribution belief from sparse chemical measurements. We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty. To enable plume-aware exploration, we introduce the gas frontier concept, defined as unobserved regions adjacent to high gas concentrations, and propose the Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for their identification. High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the benefits of XIT in terms of GDM quality and efficiency. Although developed for active GDM, XIT is readily applicable to other robotic information-gathering tasks in unknown environments that face the exploration and exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: It has long been realized that neuromorphic hardware offers benefits for the domain of robotics such as low energy, low latency, as well as unique methods of learning. In aiming for more complex tasks, especially those incorporating multimodal data, one hurdle continuing to prevent their realization is an inability to orchestrate multiple networks on neuromorphic hardware without resorting to off-chip process management logic. To address this, we show a first example of a pipeline for vision-based robot control in which numerous complex networks can be run entirely on hardware via the use of a spiking neural state machine for process orchestration. The pipeline is validated on the Intel Loihi 2 research chip. We show that all components can run concurrently on-chip in the milli Watt regime at latencies competitive with the state-of-the-art. An equivalent network on simulated hardware is shown to accomplish robotic arm plug insertion in simulation, and the core elements of the pipeline are additionally tested on a real robotic arm.

Abstract: We present a novel method for optimizing the posture of kinematically redundant torque-controlled robots to improve robustness during impacts. A rigid impact model is used as the basis for a configuration-dependent metric that quantifies the variation between pre- and post-impact velocities. By finding configurations (postures) that minimize the aforementioned metric, spikes in the robot's state and input commands can be significantly reduced during impacts, improving safety and robustness. The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID.

Abstract: While vision-language-action (VLA) models have advanced generalist robotic learning, cross-embodiment transfer remains challenging due to kinematic heterogeneity and the high cost of collecting sufficient real-world demonstrations to support fine-tuning. Existing cross-embodiment policies typically rely on shared-private architectures, which suffer from limited capacity of private parameters and lack explicit adaptation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments. Evaluations across both simulation and real-world environments validate the superiority of MOTIF, which significantly outperforms strong baselines in few-shot transfer scenarios by 6.5% in simulation and 43.7% in real-world settings.

Abstract: Building effective human-robot interaction requires robots to derive conclusions from their experiences that are both logically sound and communicated in ways aligned with human expectations. This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration.

Motivation: 现代通用机器人策略缺乏高保真物理接地，而现有接触感知策略无法泛化到多样化工具几何形状。

Result: 在刮擦、蜡笔绘制和剥离等任务中展示了强大的类别级泛化能力。

Conclusion: SCFields通过融合视觉语义与密集接触估计，实现了对未见工具的物理泛化，显著优于仅视觉和原始触觉基线。

Abstract: Generalizing tool manipulation requires both semantic planning and precise physical control. Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.
  To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines.

Conclusion: 混合预抓取/非预抓取动作原语可以显著提高长时程重排任务的效率。

Abstract: Efficient tabletop rearrangement remains challenging due to collisions and the need for temporary buffering when target poses are obstructed. Prehensile pick-and-place provides precise control but often requires extra moves, whereas non-prehensile pushing can be more efficient but suffers from complex, imprecise dynamics. This paper proposes push-placement, a hybrid action primitive that uses the grasped object to displace obstructing items while being placed, thereby reducing explicit buffering. The method is integrated into a physics-in-the-loop Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and evaluated in the PyBullet simulator. Empirical results show push-placement reduces the manipulator travel cost by up to 11.12% versus a baseline MCTS planner and 8.56% versus dynamic stacking. These findings indicate that hybrid prehensile/non-prehensile action primitives can substantially improve efficiency in long-horizon rearrangement tasks.

Abstract: We investigate a skill-based framework for humanoid box rearrangement that enables long-horizon execution by sequencing reusable skills at the task level. In our architecture, all skills execute through a shared, task-agnostic whole-body controller (WBC), providing a consistent closed-loop interface for skill composition, in contrast to non-shared designs that use separate low-level controllers per skill. We find that naively reusing the same pretrained WBC can reduce robustness over long horizons, as new skills and their compositions induce shifted state and command distributions. We address this with a simple data aggregation procedure that augments shared-WBC training with rollouts from closed-loop skill execution under domain randomization. To evaluate the approach, we introduce \emph{Humanoid Hanoi}, a long-horizon Tower-of-Hanoi box rearrangement benchmark, and report results in simulation and on the Digit V3 humanoid robot, demonstrating fully autonomous rearrangement over extended horizons and quantifying the benefits of the shared-WBC approach over non-shared baselines.

Abstract: Deploying heterogeneous robot teams to accomplish multiple tasks over extended time horizons presents significant computational challenges for task allocation and planning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive, time-extended, offline heterogeneous multi-robot task allocation framework, TRAITS, which we believe to be the first that can cope with the provisioning of exhaustible traits under battery and temporal constraints. Specifically, we introduce a nonlinear programming-based trait distribution module that can optimize the trait-provisioning rate of coalitions to yield feasible and time-efficient solutions. TRAITS provides a more accurate feasibility assessment and estimation of task execution times and makespan by leveraging trait-provisioning rates while optimizing battery consumption -- an advantage that state-of-the-art frameworks lack. We evaluate TRAITS against two state-of-the-art frameworks, with results demonstrating its advantage in satisfying complex trait and battery requirements while remaining computationally tractable.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for ensuring reliable and safe operation, as anomalies occurring during mission execution may induce discrepancies between expected and observed system behaviors, thereby compromising mission success or posing potential safety hazards. It is essential to continuously monitor and detect such conditions in order to ensure a timely response and maintain system reliability. In this work, we focus on UAV state estimation anomalies and provide a large-scale real-world UAV dataset to facilitate research aimed at improving the development of anomaly detection. Unlike existing datasets that primarily rely on injected faults into simulated data, this dataset comprises 1396 real flight logs totaling over 52 hours of flight time, collected across diverse indoor and outdoor environments using a collection of PX4-based UAVs equipped with a variety of sensor configurations. The dataset comprises both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, making it uniquely suitable for realistic anomaly detection tasks. A structured classification is proposed that categorizes UAV state estimation anomalies into four classes: mechanical and electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies. These classifications reflect collective, contextual, and outlier anomalies observed in multivariate sensor data streams, including IMU, GPS, barometer, magnetometer, distance sensors, visual odometry, and optical flow, that can be found in the PX4 logging mechanism. It is anticipated that this dataset will play a key role in the development, training, and evaluation of anomaly detection and isolation systems to address the critical gap in UAV reliability research.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个结合辐射场方法（如NeRF和高斯泼溅）的自动化环境重建流程，为行星机器人提供密集、逼真且度量一致的3D表示，为未来基于辐射场的行星探索研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Planetary exploration increasingly relies on autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, interpreting, and reconstructing their surroundings in the absence of global positioning or real-time communication with Earth. Rovers operating on planetary surfaces must navigate under sever environmental constraints, limited visual redundancy, and communication delays, making onboard spatial awareness and visual localization key components for mission success. Traditional techniques based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) provide geometric consistency but struggle to capture radiometric detail or to scale efficiently in unstructured, low-texture terrains typical of extraterrestrial environments. This work explores the integration of radiance field-based methods - specifically Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting - into a unified, automated environment reconstruction pipeline for planetary robotics. Our system combines the Nerfstudio and COLMAP frameworks with a ROS2-compatible workflow capable of processing raw rover data directly from rosbag recordings. This approach enables the generation of dense, photorealistic, and metrically consistent 3D representations from minimal visual input, supporting improved perception and planning for autonomous systems operating in planetary-like conditions. The resulting pipeline established a foundation for future research in radiance field-based mapping, bridging the gap between geometric and neural representations in planetary exploration.

Abstract: We introduce and study the Joint Task Assistance Planning problem which generalizes prior work on optimizing assistance in robotic collaboration. In this setting, two robots operate over predefined roadmaps, each represented as a graph corresponding to its configuration space. One robot, the task robot, must execute a timed mission, while the other, the assistance robot, provides sensor-based support that depends on their spatial relationship. The objective is to compute a path for both robots that maximizes the total duration of assistance given. Solving this problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible path combinations together with the temporal nature of the problem (time needs to be accounted for as well). To address this, we propose a nested branch-and-bound framework that efficiently explores the space of robot paths in a hierarchical manner. We empirically evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude when compared to a baseline approach.

Conclusion: WoVR框架通过显式控制幻觉，证明了学习的世界模型可以作为强化学习的实用模拟器，显著提升了策略优化效果和实际机器人任务的成功率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) typically treats order scheduling and multi-agent pathfinding as isolated sub-problems. We argue that this decoupling is a fundamental bottleneck, masking the critical dependencies between high-level dispatching and low-level congestion. Existing simulators fail to bridge this gap, often abstracting away heterogeneous kinematics and stochastic execution failures. We propose WareRover, a holistic simulation platform that enforces a tight coupling between OS and MAPF via a unified, closed-loop optimization interface. Unlike standard benchmarks, WareRover integrates dynamic order streams, physics-aware motion constraints, and non-nominal recovery mechanisms into a single evaluation loop. Experiments reveal that SOTA algorithms often falter under these realistic coupled constraints, demonstrating that WareRover provides a necessary and challenging testbed for robust, next-generation warehouse coordination.

Conclusion: RoboAug显著提升了机器人在多样化、未见场景中的泛化能力，减少了大规模预训练的需求，并在真实世界实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks. Our project is available at https://x-roboaug.github.io/.

We present SemanticFeels, an extension of the NeuralFeels framework that integrates semantic labeling with neural implicit shape representation, from vision and touch. To illustrate its application, we focus on material classification: high-resolution Digit tactile readings are processed by a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate local material predictions, which are then embedded into an augmented signed distance field (SDF) network that jointly predicts geometry and continuous material regions. Experimental results show that the system achieves a high correspondence between predicted and actual materials on both single- and multi-material objects, with an average matching accuracy of 79.87% across multiple manipulation trials on a multi-material object.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的双层框架通过结合图刚性和力闭合约束，成功实现了无需触觉反馈的高精度力敏感物体操作，验证了其在自定义灵巧手上的有效性。

Abstract: Precise in-hand manipulation of force-sensitive objects typically requires judicious coordinated force planning as well as accurate contact force feedback and control. Unlike multi-arm platforms with gripper end effectors, multi-fingered hands rely solely on fingertip point contacts and are not able to apply pull forces, therefore poses a more challenging problem. Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory. We validate the framework on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating the capability to manipulate fragile objects-including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg-with high precision and safety.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to the inherent discrepancy in contact dynamics. While existing methods often rely on costly real-world data or utilize blind compliance through fixed controllers, we propose a framework that leverages expert-designed controller logic for transfer. Inspired by the success of privileged supervision in kinematic tasks, we employ a human-designed finite state machine based position/force controller in simulation to provide privileged guidance. The resulting policy is trained to predict the end-effector pose, contact state, and crucially the desired contact force direction. Unlike force magnitudes, which are highly sensitive to simulation inaccuracies, force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across the sim-to-real gap. At deployment, these predictions configure a force-aware admittance controller. By combining the policy's directional intent with a constant, low-cost manually tuned force magnitude, the system generates adaptive, task-aligned compliance. This tuning is lightweight, typically requiring only a single scalar per contact state. We provide theoretical analysis for stability and robustness to disturbances. Experiments on four real-world tasks, i.e., microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines in both success rate and robustness.

Abstract: Articulated object manipulation is essential for various real-world robotic tasks, yet generalizing across diverse objects remains a major challenge. A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: In robotics and human biomechanics, the tension between energy economy and kinematic readiness is well recognized; this work brings that fundamental principle to aerial multirotors. We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation.

Abstract: A networked aerial robot team (NART) comprises a group of agents (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), ground control stations, etc.) interconnected by wireless links. Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool.

Abstract: Industrial robots are increasingly deployed in contact-rich construction and manufacturing tasks that involve uncertainty and long-horizon execution. While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots.

Abstract: We propose a novel autonomous robotic palpation framework for real-time elastic mapping during tissue exploration using a viscoelastic tissue model. The method combines force-based parameter estimation using a commercial force/torque sensor with an ergodic control strategy driven by a tailored Expected Information Density, which explicitly biases exploration toward diagnostically relevant regions by jointly considering model uncertainty, stiffness magnitude, and spatial gradients. An Extended Kalman Filter is employed to estimate viscoelastic model parameters online, while Gaussian Process Regression provides spatial modelling of the estimated elasticity, and a Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage controller enables adaptive, continuous trajectory planning. Simulations on synthetic stiffness maps demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better reconstruction accuracy, enhanced segmentation capability, and improved robustness in detecting stiff inclusions compared to Bayesian Optimisation-based techniques. Experimental validation on a silicone phantom with embedded inclusions emulating pathological tissue regions further corroborates the potential of the method for autonomous tissue characterisation in diagnostic and screening applications.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的视觉辅助导航（VAN）管道通过结合间接方法的计算效率和直接图像技术的鲁棒性，增强了解决方案的完整性。尽管SfM解决方案中存在漂移问题，但该算法展示了识别注册异常和模糊匹配等关键完整性特征，有助于实现飞机自主地面运动的稳健、可认证解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a vision-aided navigation (VAN) pipeline designed to support ground navigation of autonomous aircraft. The proposed algorithm combines the computational efficiency of indirect methods with the robustness of direct image-based techniques to enhance solution integrity. The pipeline starts by processing ground images (e.g., acquired by a taxiing aircraft) and relates them via a feature-based structure-from-motion (SfM) solution. A ground plane mosaic is then constructed via homography transforms and matched to satellite imagery using a sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities. Experimental results reveal that drift within the SfM solution, similar to that observed in dead-reckoning systems, challenges the expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with a wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic. However, the proposed algorithm demonstrates key integrity features, such as the ability to identify registration anomalies and ambiguous matches. These characteristics of the pipeline can mitigate outlier behaviors and contribute toward a robust, certifiable solution for autonomous surface movement of aircraft.

Abstract: This paper presents Adaptive Whole-body Loco-Manipulation, AdaptManip, a fully autonomous framework for humanoid robots to perform integrated navigation, object lifting, and delivery. Unlike prior imitation learning-based approaches that rely on human demonstrations and are often brittle to disturbances, AdaptManip aims to train a robust loco-manipulation policy via reinforcement learning without human demonstrations or teleoperation data. The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results show that AdaptManip significantly outperforms baseline methods, including imitation learning-based approaches, in adaptability and overall success rate, while accurate object state estimation improves manipulation performance even under occlusion. We further demonstrate fully autonomous real-world navigation, object lifting, and delivery on a humanoid robot.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation tasks in unstructured environments pose significant robustness challenges for robot learning, where unexpected collisions can cause damage and hinder policy acquisition. Existing soft end-effectors face fundamental limitations: they either provide a limited deformation range, lack directional stiffness control, or require complex actuation systems that compromise practicality. This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

Abstract: This study proposes an intelligent multi-agent framework built on LLMs and VLMs and specifically tailored to robotics. The goal is to integrate the strengths of LLMs and VLMs with computational tools to automatically analyze and solve problems related to robotic manipulators. Our developed framework accepts both textual and visual inputs and can automatically perform forward and inverse kinematics, compute velocities and accelerations of key points, generate 3D simulations of the robot, and ultimately execute motion control within the simulated environment, all according to the user's query. To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task. Similarly, for the other two models, the framework consistently outperformed the corresponding raw models in terms of accuracy. The second benchmark test was identical to the first, except that the input was provided in visual form. In this test, the GPT-4o LLM was used alongside the Gemini 2.5 Pro VLM. The results showed that the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in obtaining the final answer, which is approximately 20% higher than that of the corresponding raw model. The third benchmark test encompassed a range of robotic tasks, including simulation, control, velocity and acceleration computation, as well as inverse kinematics and Jacobian calculation, for which the framework achieved an accuracy of 0.97.

Abstract: Quadruped robots are employed in various scenarios in building construction. However, autonomous stair climbing across different indoor staircases remains a major challenge for robot dogs to complete building construction tasks. In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain.

Abstract: Robotic knot-tying represents a fundamental challenge in robotics due to the complex interactions between deformable objects and strict topological constraints. We present TWISTED-RL, a framework that improves upon the previous state-of-the-art in demonstration-free knot-tying (TWISTED), which smartly decomposed a single knot-tying problem into manageable subproblems, each addressed by a specialized agent. Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个结合信念推理、主动探测和风险监控的框架，在不确定性下进行规划，实现了更高的成功率和更短的完成时间。

Abstract: Autonomous driving in complex traffic requires reasoning under uncertainty. Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) plays an important role in assembly tasks by enabling robots to plan and adjust their motions based on interactive, real-time human instructions. However, such instructions are often linguistically ambiguous and underspecified, making it difficult to generate physically feasible and cooperative robot behaviors. To address this challenge, many studies have applied Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret high-level instructions and generate corresponding actions. Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility.

To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration.

Abstract: Endoluminal surgery offers a minimally invasive option for early-stage gastrointestinal and urinary tract cancers but is limited by surgical tools and a steep learning curve. Robotic systems, particularly continuum robots, provide flexible instruments that enable precise tissue resection, potentially improving outcomes. This paper presents a visual perception platform for a continuum robotic system in endoluminal surgery. Our goal is to utilize monocular endoscopic image-based perception algorithms to identify position and orientation of flexible instruments and measure their distances from tissues. We introduce 2D and 3D learning-based perception algorithms and develop a physically-realistic simulator that models flexible instruments dynamics. This simulator generates realistic endoluminal scenes, enabling control of flexible robots and substantial data collection. Using a continuum robot prototype, we conducted module and system-level evaluations. Results show that our algorithms improve control of flexible instruments, reducing manipulation time by over 70% for trajectory-following tasks and enhancing understanding of surgical scenarios, leading to robust endoluminal surgeries.

Method: 提出ManeuverNet，一种结合Soft Actor-Critic与CrossQ的深度强化学习框架，并设计了四种特定奖励函数以支持机动学习。

Conclusion: ManeuverNet显著提高了双阿克曼转向机器人的机动性和成功率，在现实世界试验中轨迹效率提升高达90%，展现了其鲁棒性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Autonomous control of double-Ackermann-steering robots is essential in agricultural applications, where robots must execute precise and complex maneuvers within a limited space. Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, where classical centralized approaches exhibit exponential growth in joint-state complexity as the number of agents increases. This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented QUBO formulation incorporating BFS-based logical pre-processing (achieving over 95% variable reduction), adaptive penalty design for collision and constraint enforcement, and a time-windowed decomposition strategy that enables execution within current hardware limitations. An experimental evaluation in grid environments with up to four robots demonstrated near-optimal solutions in dense scenarios and favorable scaling behavior compared to sequential classical planning. These results establish a practical and reproducible baseline for future quantum and quantum-inspired multi-robot coordinations.

Abstract: Traditional learning from demonstration (LfD) generally demands a cumbersome collection of physical demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and challenging to scale. Recent advances show that robots can instead learn from human videos by extracting interaction cues without direct robot involvement. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to generalize demonstrated interactions across different object instances that share similar functionality but vary significantly in geometry. In this work, we propose \emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner. Experiments on synthetic object categories and real-world robotic manipulation tasks show that our approach enables accurate affordance transfer with modest computational cost, making it well-suited for practical robotic perception-to-action pipelines.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于卡尔曼滤波的不确定性传播方法，通过sigmoid混合测量噪声协方差来建模AAM飞行管理系统架构，有效提高了飞行计划验证的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) operations require strategic flight planning services that predict both spatial and temporal uncertainties to safely validate flight plans against hazards such as weather cells, restricted airspaces, and CNS disruption areas. Current uncertainty estimation methods for AAM vehicles rely on conservative linear models due to limited real-world performance data. This paper presents a novel Kalman Filter-based uncertainty propagation method that models AAM Flight Management System (FMS) architectures through sigmoid-blended measurement noise covariance. Unlike existing approaches with fixed uncertainty thresholds, our method continuously adapts the filter's measurement trust based on progress toward waypoints, enabling FMS correction behavior to emerge naturally. The approach scales proportionally with control inputs and is tunable to match specific aircraft characteristics or route conditions. We validate the method using real ADS-B data from general aviation aircraft divided into training and verification sets. Uncertainty propagation parameters were tuned on the training set, achieving 76% accuracy in predicting arrival times when compared against the verification dataset, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for strategic flight plan validation in AAM operations.

Conclusion: 尽管剪刀结构在自动导航和复杂领域检查中具有潜力，但快速编程和无反馈实验中的无差错实施仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Kinematics of mechanisms is intricately coupled to their geometry and their utility often arises out of the ability to perform reproducible motion with fewer actuating degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the assembly of scissor-units, each made of two rigid linear members connected by a pin joint. The assembly has a single degree of freedom, where actuating any single unit results in a shape change of the entire assembly. We derive expressions for the effective curvature of the unit and the trajectory of the mechanism's tip as a function of the geometric variables which we then use as the basis to program two tasks in the mechanism: shape morphing and writing. By phrasing these tasks as optimization problems and utilizing the differentiable simulation framework, we arrive at solutions that are then tested in table-top experiments. Our results show that the geometry of scissor assemblies can be leveraged for automated navigation and inspection in complex domains, in light of the optimization framework. However, we highlight that the challenges associated with rapid programming and error-free implementation in experiments without feedback still remain.

Abstract: Automatically generating interactive 3D environments is crucial for scaling up robotic data collection in simulation. While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: DM0在RoboChallenge基准测试中表现出色，在Table30任务上实现了最先进的性能，证明了其作为Embodied-Native VLA框架的有效性。

Abstract: Moving beyond the traditional paradigm of adapting internet-pretrained models to physical tasks, we present DM0, an Embodied-Native Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework designed for Physical AI. Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal foundation models, embodied intelligence community still lacks a unified, physically grounded foundation model that integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within real-world spatial-temporal dynamics. We introduce RynnBrain, an open-source spatiotemporal foundation model for embodied intelligence. RynnBrain strengthens four core capabilities in a unified framework: comprehensive egocentric understanding, diverse spatiotemporal localization, physically grounded reasoning, and physics-aware planning. The RynnBrain family comprises three foundation model scales (2B, 8B, and 30B-A3B MoE) and four post-trained variants tailored for downstream embodied tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-Nav, RynnBrain-Plan, and RynnBrain-VLA) or complex spatial reasoning tasks (i.e., RynnBrain-CoP). In terms of extensive evaluations on 20 embodied benchmarks and 8 general vision understanding benchmarks, our RynnBrain foundation models largely outperform existing embodied foundation models by a significant margin. The post-trained model suite further substantiates two key potentials of the RynnBrain foundation model: (i) enabling physically grounded reasoning and planning, and (ii) serving as a strong pretrained backbone that can be efficiently adapted to diverse embodied tasks.

Conclusion: Big Picture Policies (BPP)通过利用视觉语言模型检测关键帧，显著减少了训练与部署之间的分布偏移，从而在需要历史条件依赖的任务中实现了更高的成功率。

Abstract: Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: LaySPA通过强化学习框架显著提升了大型语言模型在图形布局设计中的空间推理能力，不仅在结构有效性和视觉质量上优于大型专有LLM，还能在减少标注样本和延迟的情况下达到与专业SOTA布局生成器相当的性能。

Abstract: We introduce LaySPA, a reinforcement learning framework that equips large language models (LLMs) with explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for content-aware graphic layout design. LaySPA addresses two key challenges: LLMs' limited spatial reasoning and the lack of opacity in design decision making. Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency.

Method: 研究提出了一种决策否定型、人在回路中的代理系统，该系统包含对抗性自我批判机制作为安全架构，并开发了失败模式的正式分类法。

Conclusion: 对抗性自我批判机制在受监管的高风险保险核保中显著提升了AI的安全性和决策准确性，同时确保了人类对关键决策的最终控制权。

Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.

TL;DR: A scalable evaluation framework using fixed game AI hierarchies measures LLM strategic reasoning, revealing performance disparities and strategic behaviors across diverse games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities, lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking.

Method: Built on the Botzone platform, BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games, systematically assessing 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models.

Result: The evaluation reveals significant performance disparities and identifies distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains.

Conclusion: The anchored evaluation paradigm using fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game AI provides a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities, generalizing beyond games to domains with well-defined skill hierarchies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive environments requiring strategic decision-making, yet systematic evaluation of these capabilities remains challenging. Existing benchmarks for LLMs primarily assess static reasoning through isolated tasks and fail to capture dynamic strategic abilities. Recent game-based evaluations employ LLM-vs-LLM tournaments that produce relative rankings dependent on transient model pools, incurring quadratic computational costs and lacking stable performance anchors for longitudinal tracking. The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability. Built on the Botzone platform's established competitive infrastructure, our BotzoneBench evaluates LLMs across eight diverse games spanning deterministic perfect-information board games to stochastic imperfect-information card games. Through systematic assessment of 177,047 state-action pairs from five flagship models, we reveal significant performance disparities and identify distinct strategic behaviors, with top-performing models achieving proficiency comparable to mid-to-high-tier specialized game AI in multiple domains. This anchored evaluation paradigm generalizes beyond games to any domain with well-defined skill hierarchies, establishing a scalable and reusable framework for assessing interactive AI capabilities.

*Haoran Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMOR通过动态路由稀疏注意力与SSM，高效解决长序列检索问题，性能优于基线且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有位置分配均匀计算资源，效率低下；SSM虽高效但长序列信息检索能力不足。受双过程认知理论启发，AMOR旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 提出AMOR架构，利用SSM隐藏状态生成Ghost KV，动态触发稀疏注意力以减少计算开销。通过预测熵衡量不确定性，仅在需要时激活注意力机制。

Result: 在小规模合成检索任务中，AMOR以仅22%的注意力覆盖率实现完美检索精度，预测熵差异达1.09纳特，显著优于纯SSM或Transformer基线。

Conclusion: AMOR（自适应元认知输出路由器）通过动态结合稀疏注意力与SSM骨干网络，在保持高效计算的同时，显著提升了长序列信息检索的准确性。其基于预测熵的路由机制不仅提高了性能，还提供了可解释的自适应计算。

Abstract: Transformers allocate uniform computation to every position, regardless of difficulty. State Space Models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives but struggle with precise information retrieval over a long horizon. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition (Kahneman, 2011), we propose AMOR (Adaptive Metacognitive Output Router), a hybrid architecture that dynamically engages sparse attention only when an SSM backbone is "uncertain"--as measured by prediction entropy. Compared to standard transformers, AMOR gains efficiency by projecting keys and values from SSM hidden states (Ghost KV), reusing the SSM's O(n) computation rather than requiring O(n^2) attention at every layer. On small-scale synthetic retrieval tasks, AMOR outperforms both SSM-only and transformer-only baselines, achieving perfect retrieval accuracy while engaging attention on only 22% of positions. We validate that prediction entropy reliably signals retrieval need, with a gap of 1.09 nats (nearly half the entropy range) between retrieval and local positions. Additionally, our approach provides interpretable adaptive computation, where routing decisions can be understood in information-theoretic terms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeRA通过自动生成无限验证变体的框架，解决了静态评估的问题，提升了评估的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方案的静态性质导致记忆、格式利用和饱和问题，需要构建鲁棒的评估方法以真实衡量AI进展。

Method: VeRA框架包括自然语言模板、连贯生成器和确定性验证器，支持两种模式：VeRA-E（等效）用于检测记忆与真实推理，VeRA-H（硬化）用于生成高难度任务。

Result: VeRA-E提高了评估质量并揭示了污染模式，VeRA-H实现了无需人工的高难度任务生成，VeRA确立了验证基准作为通用范式。

Conclusion: VeRA提出了一种新的评估框架，将基准问题转化为可执行的规范，通过自动生成无限验证变体来增强评估的鲁棒性和成本效益，并开源了所有代码和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: The main issue with most evaluation schemes today is their "static" nature: the same problems are reused repeatedly, allowing for memorization, format exploitation, and eventual saturation. To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.
  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.
  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity. To stimulate future research, we have open-sourced all code and datasets.

TL;DR: SSLogic通过迭代合成和修复程序对，扩展可验证训练信号规模，提升多个基准测试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可验证奖励强化学习中训练信号扩展的关键瓶颈，逻辑推理因其形式化约束和可编程检查性成为理想选择。

Method: 提出了SSLogic，一个基于生成-验证-修复闭环的元合成框架，结合多门验证协议和对抗性盲审，以确保任务的可靠性和难度可控。

Result: 从400个种子家族扩展到953个家族和21,389个可验证实例，训练数据显著提升多个基准测试性能。

Conclusion: SSLogic框架通过迭代合成和修复可执行的生成器-验证器程序对，显著扩展了可验证训练信号的规模，并在多个基准测试中实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Scaling verifiable training signals remains a key bottleneck for Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Logical reasoning is a natural substrate: constraints are formal and answers are programmatically checkable. However, prior synthesis pipelines either depend on expert-written code or operate within fixed templates/skeletons, which limits growth largely to instance-level perturbations. We propose SSLogic, an agentic meta-synthesis framework that scales at the task-family level by iteratively synthesizing and repairing executable Generator--Validator program pairs in a closed Generate--Validate--Repair loop, enabling continuous family evolution with controllable difficulty. To ensure reliability, we introduce a Multi-Gate Validation Protocol that combines multi-strategy consistency checks with Adversarial Blind Review, where independent agents must solve instances by writing and executing code to filter ambiguous or ill-posed tasks. Starting from 400 seed families, two evolution rounds expand to 953 families and 21,389 verifiable instances (from 5,718). Training on SSLogic-evolved data yields consistent gains over the seed baseline at matched training steps, improving SynLogic by +5.2, BBEH by +1.4, AIME25 by +3.0, and Brumo25 by +3.7.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文区分了三种幻觉类型，发现检测性能因类型和领域而异，提出几何分类法并指出类型III需外部验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中‘幻觉’术语混淆不同现象的问题，并探索其几何特征。

Method: 通过观察嵌入空间中不同幻觉类型的几何特征，提出分类法并分析其检测性能。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，幻觉检测在领域内AUROC为0.76-0.99，跨领域为0.50；人类制作的虚构内容检测AUROC为0.96。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种几何分类法，明确了基于嵌入的检测范围：类型I和II可检测，类型III需要外部验证机制。

Abstract: The term "hallucination" in large language models conflates distinct phenomena with different geometric signatures in embedding space. We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms.

TL;DR: VaryBalance通过量化人类文本与LLM改写版本的差异，显著提升LLM生成文本检测性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器依赖不切实际的假设（如白盒设置）或仅依赖文本级特征，导致检测能力不精确。

Method: 提出VaryBalance方法，核心思想是利用人类文本与LLM改写版本之间的差异（通过均值标准差量化），区分人类文本和LLM生成文本。

Result: 实验表明，VaryBalance在AUROC指标上优于现有最佳检测器Binoculars达34.3%，并在多模型和语言环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: VaryBalance是一种简单、有效且实用的LLM生成文本检测方法，通过量化人类文本与LLM改写版本之间的差异，显著提升了检测性能，并在多模型和语言环境下保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial but challenging. Existing detectors depend on impractical assumptions, such as white-box settings, or solely rely on text-level features, leading to imprecise detection ability. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective and practical LLM-generated text detection method, VaryBalance. The core of VaryBalance is that, compared to LLM-generated texts, there is a greater difference between human texts and their rewritten version via LLMs. Leveraging this observation, VaryBalance quantifies this through mean standard deviation and distinguishes human texts and LLM-generated texts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that VaryBalance outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors, i.e., Binoculars, by up to 34.3\% in terms of AUROC, and maintains robustness against multiple generating models and languages.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出轨迹主导的帕累托优化框架，揭示长期适应性停滞源于优化几何的深层结构特性，并引入TEDI量化约束刚性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能近期取得进展，许多系统在长期适应性上仍表现停滞。研究认为这种限制主要源于智能优化过程中的深层结构特性，而非学习、数据或模型容量的不足。

Method: 引入了轨迹主导的帕累托优化（Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization），一种路径级的帕累托最优性推广，其中优势定义在完整轨迹上。定义了陷阱逃逸难度指数（TEDI），一个综合几何度量，捕捉逃逸距离、结构约束和行为惯性。

Result: 研究表明动态智能上限是轨迹级优势的必然几何结果，与学习进展或架构规模无关。通过最小代理-环境模型展示了轨迹级分歧。

Conclusion: 该研究将智能的焦点从终端性能转移到优化几何，提供了一个诊断和克服自适应系统中长期发展约束的原则性框架。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, many systems exhibit stagnation in long-horizon adaptability despite continued performance optimization. This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems.

*Mayank Ravishankara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlotChain是一个评估多模态大语言模型从工程图表中恢复定量值的基准测试工具，结果显示部分模型表现良好，但频域任务仍是挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在工程图表读取（如从Bode/FFT图中恢复定量值）方面的能力缺乏标准化评估工具。PlotChain旨在填补这一空白，提供可复现的基准测试。

Method: PlotChain包含15个图表家族，共450个渲染图表，每个图表均基于已知参数生成，并配有精确的真实值。通过检查点式诊断评估（如‘cp_’字段）来定位模型在特定子技能（如读取截止频率或峰值幅度）上的失败。

Result: 在标准化协议下（温度=0，严格JSON输出），Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳（80.42%通过率），GPT-4.1和Claude Sonnet 4.5次之，GPT-4o表现较差（61.59%）。频域任务表现普遍不佳（如带通响应通过率≤23%）。

Conclusion: PlotChain是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的确定性基准测试工具，通过生成器创建的工程图表数据集（如Bode/FFT、阶跃响应等）来测试模型从图表中恢复定量值的能力。尽管部分模型表现良好（如Gemini 2.5 Pro达到80.42%的通过率），但频域任务（如带通响应和FFT频谱）仍然是挑战。

Abstract: We present PlotChain, a deterministic, generator-based benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on engineering plot reading-recovering quantitative values from classic plots (e.g., Bode/FFT, step response, stress-strain, pump curves) rather than OCR-only extraction or free-form captioning. PlotChain contains 15 plot families with 450 rendered plots (30 per family), where every item is produced from known parameters and paired with exact ground truth computed directly from the generating process. A central contribution is checkpoint-based diagnostic evaluation: in addition to final targets, each item includes intermediate 'cp_' fields that isolate sub-skills (e.g., reading cutoff frequency or peak magnitude) and enable failure localization within a plot family. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MLLMs under a standardized, deterministic protocol (temperature = 0 and a strict JSON-only numeric output schema) and score predictions using per-field tolerances designed to reflect human plot-reading precision. Under the 'plotread' tolerance policy, the top models achieve 80.42% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 79.84% (GPT-4.1), and 78.21% (Claude Sonnet 4.5) overall field-level pass rates, while GPT-4o trails at 61.59%. Despite strong performance on many families, frequency-domain tasks remain brittle: bandpass response stays low (<= 23%), and FFT spectrum remains challenging. We release the generator, dataset, raw model outputs, scoring code, and manifests with checksums to support fully reproducible runs and retrospective rescoring under alternative tolerance policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于训练的解决方案在角色扮演中对抗越狱攻击时的高成本、行为退化及不适用于前沿闭源LLM的问题。

Method: 通过两个耦合的循环（Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle和Role-Playing Defender Cycle）实现训练自由的对抗性自我进化框架。

Result: 实验证明该框架在多个专有LLM上均优于基线模型，同时在角色忠实度和抗越狱攻击能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution框架在保持角色忠实度的同时显著提升了抗越狱攻击能力，并能泛化到未见过的角色和攻击提示。

Abstract: LLM-based role-playing has rapidly improved in fidelity, yet stronger adherence to persona constraints commonly increases vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, especially for risky or negative personas. Most prior work mitigates this issue with training-time solutions (e.g., data curation or alignment-oriented regularization). However, these approaches are costly to maintain as personas and attack strategies evolve, can degrade in-character behavior, and are typically infeasible for frontier closed-weight LLMs. We propose a training-free Dual-Cycle Adversarial Self-Evolution framework with two coupled cycles. A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints. Extensive experiments across multiple proprietary LLMs show consistent gains over strong baselines on both role fidelity and jailbreak resistance, and robust generalization to unseen personas and attack prompts.

Conclusion: Lang2Act通过自涌现的语言工具链显著提升了视觉语言模型的视觉感知能力，实验结果显示性能提升超过4%。

Abstract: Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) enhances Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by incorporating external visual documents to address a given query. Existing VRAG frameworks usually depend on rigid, pre-defined external tools to extend the perceptual capabilities of VLMs, typically by explicitly separating visual perception from subsequent reasoning processes. However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lang2Act in substantially enhancing the visual perception capabilities of VLMs, achieving performance improvements of over 4%.

Motivation: 现有方法在全局语法约束的强制性和条款级语义理解方面存在不足，导致语法控制脆弱和语义忠实度低。

Method: NL2LOGIC结合了基于递归大型语言模型的语义解析器和抽象语法树引导的生成器，以确定性方式生成可供求解器使用的逻辑代码。

Conclusion: NL2LOGIC框架通过引入抽象语法树作为中间表示，显著提升了逻辑翻译的语法准确性和语义正确性，并在下游推理任务中实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Automated reasoning is critical in domains such as law and governance, where verifying claims against facts in documents requires both accuracy and interpretability. Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码大语言模型在受限许可源代码训练中的数据治理和版权挑战，通过成员推理攻击(MIAs)作为审计机制检测未经授权的数据使用。

Method: 通过比较Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC)和Loss Attack等方法的性能，并引入基于抽象语法树(AST)的扰动方法AST-PAC来生成语法有效的校准样本。

Result: AST-PAC在语法复杂性增加时表现优于PAC，但在小文件和字母数字丰富代码中表现不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语法感知和大小自适应校准对未来代码语言模型来源审计的重要性，并提出了AST-PAC作为改进方向。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models are frequently trained on massive datasets containing restrictively licensed source code. This creates urgent data governance and copyright challenges. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can serve as an auditing mechanism to detect unauthorized data usage in models. While attacks like the Loss Attack provide a baseline, more involved methods like Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) remain underexplored in the code domain. This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models.

TL;DR: X-Blocks框架通过分层分析（上下文、句法、词汇）为自动驾驶系统提供自然语言解释的设计原则，RACE分类器表现接近人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏系统框架来分析人类如何在不同场景中语言化构建驾驶理由，而自然语言解释在建立对自动驾驶车辆的信任和接受度中至关重要。

Method: 提出了X-Blocks分层分析框架，包括上下文、句法和词汇三个层次。在上下文层面，使用RACE（多LLM集成框架）进行分类；在词汇层面，采用对数几率分析和信息性Dirichlet先验；在句法层面，应用依赖解析和模板提取。

Result: RACE在Berkeley DeepDrive-X数据集上达到91.45%的准确率和0.91的Cohen's kappa，表明上下文分类接近人类可靠性。词汇和句法分析揭示了场景特定的词汇模式和可重用的语法家族。

Conclusion: X-Blocks框架提供了基于证据的语言设计原则，支持自动驾驶系统中的透明度、用户信任和认知可访问性。

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a critical role in establishing trust and acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs), yet existing approaches lack systematic frameworks for analysing how humans linguistically construct driving rationales across diverse scenarios. This paper introduces X-Blocks (eXplanation Blocks), a hierarchical analytical framework that identifies the linguistic building blocks of natural language explanations for AVs at three levels: context, syntax, and lexicon.
  At the context level, we propose RACE (Reasoning-Aligned Classification of Explanations), a multi-LLM ensemble framework that combines Chain-of-Thought reasoning with self-consistency mechanisms to robustly classify explanations into 32 scenario-aware categories. Applied to human-authored explanations from the Berkeley DeepDrive-X dataset, RACE achieves 91.45 percent accuracy and a Cohens kappa of 0.91 against cases with human annotator agreement, indicating near-human reliability for context classification.
  At the lexical level, log-odds analysis with informative Dirichlet priors reveals context-specific vocabulary patterns that distinguish driving scenarios. At the syntactic level, dependency parsing and template extraction show that explanations draw from a limited repertoire of reusable grammar families, with systematic variation in predicate types and causal constructions across contexts.
  The X-Blocks framework is dataset-agnostic and task-independent, offering broad applicability to other automated driving datasets and safety-critical domains. Overall, our findings provide evidence-based linguistic design principles for generating scenario-aware explanations that support transparency, user trust, and cognitive accessibility in automated driving systems.

TL;DR: DPBench基准测试显示LLM在多代理系统中同时决策时协调失败率高，需外部协调机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型在多代理系统中资源竞争下的协调能力。

Method: 基于哲学家就餐问题（Dining Philosophers）引入DPBench基准测试，评估LLM在八种不同条件下的协调能力，包括决策时机、群体规模和通信。

Result: 实验发现LLM在顺序设置中能有效协调，但在同时决策时失败率高达95%，且通信并未解决问题，反而可能增加死锁率。

Conclusion: 多代理LLM系统在需要并发资源访问时可能需要外部协调机制，而非依赖自发的协调。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE框架通过分解记忆、学习和个性化机制，显著提升了LLM代理的个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理将记忆、学习和个性化视为统一能力，限制了其适应个体用户的能力，因此需要一种更有效的分解方法。

Method: 提出了MAPLE框架，将记忆、学习和个性化分解为三个独立的子代理，每个子代理拥有专用工具和明确定义的接口。

Result: 在MAPLE-Personas基准测试中，个性化评分提升了14.6%，特质融入率从45%提高到75%。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过将记忆、学习和个性化分解为三个独立的机制，显著提升了LLM代理的个性化能力，实验证明其在个性化评分和特质融入率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

TL;DR: SELFCEST通过并行克隆和智能资源分配提升语言模型效率，在固定预算下表现更优且泛化能力强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在测试时计算效率低下，尤其是在串行推理或无协调并行采样时，SELFCEST旨在通过并行克隆和智能资源分配提升效率。

Method: SELFCEST通过强化学习训练一个控制器，使基础模型能够在并行上下文中生成相同权重的克隆，并智能分配生成和上下文资源。

Result: 在数学推理和长上下文多跳问答任务中，SELFCEST在相同推理预算下比传统方法更高效，且展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SELFCEST通过并行克隆和智能资源分配，在固定推理预算下显著提升了语言模型的效率和准确性，并在不同领域展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Frontier language models improve with additional test-time computation, but serial reasoning or uncoordinated parallel sampling can be compute-inefficient under fixed inference budgets. We propose SELFCEST, which equips a base model with the ability to spawn same-weight clones in separate parallel contexts by agentic reinforcement learning. Training is end-to-end under a global task reward with shared-parameter rollouts, yielding a learned controller that allocates both generation and context budget across branches. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks and long-context multi-hop QA, SELFCEST improves the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier relative to monolithic baselines at matched inference budget, and exhibits out-of-distribution generalization in both domains.

Motivation: 随着网络威胁的复杂性和频率增加，需要既准确又可解释的入侵检测系统（IDS）。

Method: 提出了一个集成可解释人工智能（XAI）的新型入侵检测系统（IDS）框架，结合了卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）来捕获流量序列的时间依赖性，并使用SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）确保模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在网络安全解决方案中结合性能和透明度的潜力，并建议通过自适应学习实现实时威胁检测的未来改进。

Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

TL;DR: TemporalBench是一个多领域基准测试，用于评估模型在不同信息设置下的时间推理能力，发现现有模型在上下文和事件驱动条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨强预测性能是否真正反映时间理解能力，还是仅依赖上下文和事件驱动条件。

Method: 通过四层次任务分类法（历史结构解释、无上下文预测、上下文时间推理、事件条件预测）在四个实际领域进行评估。

Result: 实验显示，高数值预测准确率并不等同于稳健的上下文或事件感知时间推理能力，现有模型存在分散优势和系统性失败模式。

Conclusion: TemporalBench揭示了现有模型在上下文和事件驱动条件下的时间推理能力不足，强调需要更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks. The TemporalBench dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TemporalBench, and we additionally provide a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Melady/TemporalBench_Leaderboard.

Method: 引入了ProMoral-Bench基准，评估了四种LLM家族的11种提示范式，使用ETHICS、Scruples、WildJailbreak和新的ETHICS-Contrast测试，通过提出的统一道德安全评分（UMSS）衡量性能。

Result: 结果显示，简洁的示例引导支架在UMSS分数和鲁棒性上优于复杂多阶段推理，且令牌成本更低；多轮推理在扰动下表现脆弱，而少样本示例能持续提升道德稳定性和抗越狱能力。

Conclusion: ProMoral-Bench提供了一个标准化的框架，用于原则性、成本效益高的提示工程，证明简洁、示例引导的提示支架优于复杂的多阶段推理。

Abstract: Prompt design significantly impacts the moral competence and safety alignment of large language models (LLMs), yet empirical comparisons remain fragmented across datasets and models.We introduce ProMoral-Bench, a unified benchmark evaluating 11 prompting paradigms across four LLM families. Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost. While multi-turn reasoning proves fragile under perturbations, few-shot exemplars consistently enhance moral stability and jailbreak resistance. ProMoral-Bench establishes a standardized framework for principled, cost-effective prompt engineering.

Motivation: 探索如何通过组织结构而非个体对齐来实现多智能体系统的可靠行为，借鉴人类机构的集体行为模式。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（Perseverance Composition Engine），通过分工（Composer、Corroborator、Critic）和信息不对称设计实现分层验证。

Result: 在474次文档组合任务中，系统表现出从尝试伪造内容转向诚实拒绝的行为，验证了架构设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 组织理论为多智能体AI安全提供了一个富有成效的框架，通过信息隔离实现的结构性验证和评估，可以从不可靠的个体组件中获得可靠的集体行为。

Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.

Motivation: 由于隐私问题和纵向研究的高成本，收集真实学生学习数据具有挑战性。现有大型语言模型存在能力偏差，无法模拟新手学习者的反复试错行为。

Method: BEAGLE采用半马尔可夫模型、贝叶斯知识追踪与显式缺陷注入，以及解耦的代理设计，分别管理认知行为、模拟知识缺口和分离策略与代码生成。

Result: 在Python编程任务评估中，BEAGLE显著优于现有基线，且在人类图灵测试中，用户无法区分合成数据与真实学生数据（准确率52.8%）。

Conclusion: BEAGLE框架通过整合自我调节学习理论和神经符号方法，成功模拟了真实学生的学习行为，显著优于现有基线，并在人类图灵测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Simulating student learning behaviors in open-ended problem-solving environments holds potential for education research, from training adaptive tutoring systems to stress-testing pedagogical interventions. However, collecting authentic data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the high cost of longitudinal studies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising path to student simulation, they suffer from competency bias, optimizing for efficient correctness rather than the erratic, iterative struggle characteristic of novice learners. We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and "unknown unknowns"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%).

Motivation: 探讨现代AI系统（尤其是生成模型）在不同使用场景下，用户对准确性的权衡及其影响因素。

Method: 通过在线调查（N=300），收集受访者在工作和个人生活中对AI工具准确性的要求及其影响因素的数据。

Result: 工作环境下对高准确性的需求显著高于个人生活（24.1% vs. 8.8%），且工具不可用时个人生活受影响更大（34.1% vs. 15.3%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，人们在工作和个人生活中对AI工具准确性的要求存在显著差异，工作环境下对高准确性的需求更高。此外，当AI工具不可用时，个人生活比工作受到的影响更大。

Abstract: We study how people trade off accuracy when using AI-powered tools in professional versus personal contexts for adoption purposes, the determinants of those trade-offs, and how users cope when AI/apps are unavailable. Because modern AI systems (especially generative models) can produce acceptable but non-identical outputs, we define "accuracy" as context-specific reliability: the degree to which an output aligns with the user's intent within a tolerance threshold that depends on stakes and the cost of correction. In an online survey (N=300), among respondents with both accuracy items (N=170), the share requiring high accuracy (top-box) is 24.1% at work vs. 8.8% in personal life (+15.3 pp; z=6.29, p<0.001). The gap remains large under a broader top-two-box definition (67.0% vs. 32.9%) and on the full 1-5 ordinal scale (mean 3.86 vs. 3.08). Heavy app use and experience patterns correlate with stricter work standards (H2). When tools are unavailable (H3), respondents report more disruption in personal routines than at work (34.1% vs. 15.3%, p<0.01). We keep the main text focused on these substantive results and place test taxonomy and power derivations in a technical appendix.

Result: 质量在五个维度上测量，包括功能完整性、变量保真度、状态机正确性、业务逻辑保真度和代码质量，并汇总为综合评分。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能合约合成质量的实证研究提供了可复现的基准，并支持扩展到形式验证和合规性检查。

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation of LLM-generated smart contracts from natural-language specifications. The system parses contractual text into structured schemas, generates Solidity code, and performs automated quality assessment through compilation and security checks. Using CrewAI-style agent teams with iterative refinement, the pipeline produces structured artifacts with full provenance metadata. Quality is measured across five dimensions, including functional completeness, variable fidelity, state-machine correctness, business-logic fidelity, and code quality aggregated into composite scores. The framework supports paired evaluation against ground-truth implementations, quantifying alignment and identifying systematic error modes such as logic omissions and state transition inconsistencies. This provides a reproducible benchmark for empirical research on smart contract synthesis quality and supports extensions to formal verification and compliance checking.

Motivation: 现代伦理审查系统面临大规模跨学科研究带来的结构性伦理风险，现有审查能力不足，而大语言模型（LLMs）的直接应用受限于伦理推理能力不足、与监管结构整合弱及隐私限制。

Method: 引入Mirror框架，结合EthicsLLM（基于EthicsQA微调的基础模型）和两种模式：Mirror-ER（自动化快速审查）和Mirror-CR（模拟委员会审议）。

Result: 实证评估显示，Mirror相比通用LLMs显著提升了伦理评估的质量、一致性和专业性。

Conclusion: Mirror框架通过EthicsLLM和两种互补模式（Mirror-ER和Mirror-CR）显著提升了伦理审查的质量、一致性和专业性，为大规模跨学科研究的伦理治理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ethics review is a foundational mechanism of modern research governance, yet contemporary systems face increasing strain as ethical risks arise as structural consequences of large-scale, interdisciplinary scientific practice. The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs.

Method: 提出AutoWebWorld框架，将Web环境建模为有限状态机（FSM），并通过编码代理将FSM转化为交互式网站，实现程序化验证。

Result: 生成了11,663条已验证轨迹，成本仅为每条0.04美元；7B Web GUI代理在WebVoyager上15步内超越所有基线，且性能随合成数据量增加而提升。

Conclusion: AutoWebWorld通过合成可控且可验证的Web环境，显著提升了自主Web GUI代理的性能，并展示了数据量与性能之间的明确缩放规律。

Abstract: The performance of autonomous Web GUI agents heavily relies on the quality and quantity of their training data. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: collecting interaction trajectories from real-world websites is expensive and difficult to verify. The underlying state transitions are hidden, leading to reliance on inconsistent and costly external verifiers to evaluate step-level correctness. To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites. Unlike real websites, where state transitions are implicit, AutoWebWorld explicitly defines all states, actions, and transition rules. This enables programmatic verification: action correctness is checked against predefined rules, and task success is confirmed by reaching a goal state in the FSM graph. AutoWebWorld enables a fully automated search-and-verify pipeline, generating over 11,663 verified trajectories from 29 diverse web environments at only $0.04 per trajectory. Training on this synthetic data significantly boosts real-world performance. Our 7B Web GUI agent outperforms all baselines within 15 steps on WebVoyager. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling law: as the synthetic data volume increases, performance on WebVoyager and Online-Mind2Web consistently improves.

Abstract: Automatically generating and iteratively editing academic slide decks requires more than document summarization. It demands faithful content selection, coherent slide organization, layout-aware rendering, and robust multi-turn instruction following. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols do not adequately measure these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Deck Edits and Compliance Kit Benchmark (DECKBench), an evaluation framework for multi-agent slide generation and editing. DECKBench is built on a curated dataset of paper to slide pairs augmented with realistic, simulated editing instructions. Our evaluation protocol systematically assesses slide-level and deck-level fidelity, coherence, layout quality, and multi-turn instruction following. We further implement a modular multi-agent baseline system that decomposes the slide generation and editing task into paper parsing and summarization, slide planning, HTML creation, and iterative editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark highlights strengths, exposes failure modes, and provides actionable insights for improving multi-agent slide generation and editing systems. Overall, this work establishes a standardized foundation for reproducible and comparable evaluation of academic presentation generation and editing.

Motivation: 大多数网络代理在人类界面级别操作，缺乏应用级访问，限制了鲁棒性和动作表达能力。企业环境中可同时控制前端和后端，因此提出了EmbeWebAgent。

Method: EmbeWebAgent采用前端钩子（如ARIA和URL观察、每页功能注册）和后端工作流，支持从GUI原语到高级复合操作的混合粒度动作。

Result: 演示显示，EmbeWebAgent需要最小改造工作，并在实时UI环境中展现出稳健的多步行为。

Conclusion: EmbeWebAgent框架通过轻量级前端钩子和可重用后端工作流，实现了在现有UI中直接嵌入代理，展示了在实时UI环境中的稳健多步行为。

Abstract: Most web agents operate at the human interface level, observing screenshots or raw DOM trees without application-level access, which limits robustness and action expressiveness. In enterprise settings, however, explicit control of both the frontend and backend is available. We present EmbeWebAgent, a framework for embedding agents directly into existing UIs using lightweight frontend hooks (curated ARIA and URL-based observations, and a per-page function registry exposed via a WebSocket) and a reusable backend workflow that performs reasoning and takes actions. EmbeWebAgent is stack-agnostic (e.g., React or Angular), supports mixed-granularity actions ranging from GUI primitives to higher-level composites, and orchestrates navigation, manipulation, and domain-specific analytics via MCP tools. Our demo shows minimal retrofitting effort and robust multi-step behaviors grounded in a live UI setting. Live Demo: https://youtu.be/Cy06Ljee1JQ

Result: 研究发现潜在状态推理比表面提取更具挑战性，支持了结构优先的数据合成策略。

Conclusion: SGP任务展示了潜在状态推理的复杂性，并验证了结构优先的数据合成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Perspective-Aware AI requires modeling evolving internal states--goals, emotions, contexts--not merely preferences. Progress is limited by a data bottleneck: digital footprints are privacy-sensitive and perspective states are rarely labeled. We propose Situation Graph Prediction (SGP), a task that frames perspective modeling as an inverse inference problem: reconstructing structured, ontology-aligned representations of perspective from observable multimodal artifacts. To enable grounding without real labels, we use a structure-first synthetic generation strategy that aligns latent labels and observable traces by design. As a pilot, we construct a dataset and run a diagnostic study using retrieval-augmented in-context learning as a proxy for supervision. In our study with GPT-4o, we observe a gap between surface-level extraction and latent perspective inference--indicating latent-state inference is harder than surface extraction under our controlled setting. Results suggest SGP is non-trivial and provide evidence for the structure-first data synthesis strategy.

Conclusion: 该框架为企业数字资产的自动化重组和高效重用提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: To address the ``reusability dilemma'' and structural hallucinations in enterprise Agentic AI,this paper proposes ReusStdFlow, a framework centered on a novel ``Extraction-Storage-Construction'' paradigm. The framework deconstructs heterogeneous, platform-specific Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) into standardized, modular workflow segments. It employs a dual knowledge architecture-integrating graph and vector databases-to facilitate synergistic retrieval of both topological structures and functional semantics. Finally, workflows are intelligently assembled using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy. Tested on 200 real-world n8n workflows, the system achieves over 90% accuracy in both extraction and construction. This framework provides a standardized solution for the automated reorganization and efficient reuse of enterprise digital assets.

TL;DR: 论文首次提出理论框架分析MCP代理中的错误累积，证明失真线性增长且偏差有界，实验验证并提出可信代理部署原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着由大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的AI代理越来越多地使用外部工具进行高风险决策，一个关键的可靠性问题出现了：错误如何在顺序工具调用中传播？

Method: 开发了一个混合失真度量标准，结合了离散事实匹配和连续语义相似性，并建立了关于通过顺序工具交互传播错误的martingale浓度界限。

Result: 实验验证了理论预测，表明经验失真跟踪线性趋势，偏差始终在$O(\sqrt{T})$范围内。关键发现包括：语义加权减少了80%的失真，每约9步重新接地足以控制错误。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个理论框架来分析MCP代理中的错误累积问题，证明了累积失真呈现线性增长和高概率偏差有界于$O(\sqrt{T})$，从而确保系统行为的可预测性并排除了指数级故障模式。通过实验验证了理论预测，并提出了可信代理系统的可操作部署原则。

Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种可扩展且可解释的方法，用于在安全关键的临床对话系统中检测越狱行为，并指出了当前注释和特征表示的关键限制，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Detecting jailbreak attempts in clinical training large language models (LLMs) requires accurate modeling of linguistic deviations that signal unsafe or off-task user behavior. Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems.

Motivation: 支持透明度和信任发展，解决现有解释机制无法回答对比性问题的局限性。

Method: 扩展了BDI代理的机制以回答对比性问题，并进行了计算和人类主体评估。

Result: 对比性解释显著缩短了解释长度，并在某些情况下提高了信任和理解。

Conclusion: 尽管对比性解释在某些情况下提高了信任和理解，但提供完整解释并不总是优于不提供解释。

Abstract: The ability of autonomous systems to provide explanations is important for supporting transparency and aiding the development of (appropriate) trust. Prior work has defined a mechanism for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to be able to answer questions of the form ``why did you do action $X$?''. However, we know that we ask \emph{contrastive} questions (``why did you do $X$ \emph{instead of} $F$?''). We therefore extend previous work to be able to answer such questions. A computational evaluation shows that using contrastive questions yields a significant reduction in explanation length. A human subject evaluation was conducted to assess whether such contrastive answers are preferred, and how well they support trust development and transparency. We found some evidence for contrastive answers being preferred, and some evidence that they led to higher trust, perceived understanding, and confidence in the system's correctness. We also evaluated the benefit of providing explanations at all. Surprisingly, there was not a clear benefit, and in some situations we found evidence that providing a (full) explanation was worse than not providing any explanation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create the first open-source small language model (SLM) that achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning in a single model with only 3B parameters.

Method: The model combines point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling for reasoning and preference alignment, complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning for code generation, and complex data synthesis with turn-level supervision for deep search.

Result: Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale and even achieves superior performance compared to much larger models.

Conclusion: Nanbeige4.1-3B demonstrates that small models can achieve broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.

Abstract: We present Nanbeige4.1-3B, a unified generalist language model that simultaneously achieves strong agentic behavior, code generation, and general reasoning with only 3B parameters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first open-source small language model (SLM) to achieve such versatility in a single model. To improve reasoning and preference alignment, we combine point-wise and pair-wise reward modeling, ensuring high-quality, human-aligned responses. For code generation, we design complexity-aware rewards in Reinforcement Learning, optimizing both correctness and efficiency. In deep search, we perform complex data synthesis and incorporate turn-level supervision during training. This enables stable long-horizon tool interactions, allowing Nanbeige4.1-3B to reliably execute up to 600 tool-call turns for complex problem-solving. Extensive experimental results show that Nanbeige4.1-3B significantly outperforms prior models of similar scale, such as Nanbeige4-3B-2511 and Qwen3-4B, even achieving superior performance compared to much larger models, such as Qwen3-30B-A3B. Our results demonstrate that small models can achieve both broad competence and strong specialization simultaneously, redefining the potential of 3B parameter models.

Abstract: Evaluating moral alignment in agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms is a critical challenge at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science. We introduce Morality Chains, a novel formalism for representing moral norms as ordered deontic constraints, and MoralityGym, a benchmark of 98 ethical-dilemma problems presented as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments. By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning. Baseline results with Safe RL methods reveal key limitations, underscoring the need for more principled approaches to ethical decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 简化训练策略（on-policy SFT）通过去除KL正则化和分组归一化，仅保留基于截断的长度惩罚，显著提升了训练效率和性能，在保持准确率的同时将推理长度减少80%，并在五个基准测试中超越复杂RL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the necessity of complex multi-reward objectives in training large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning (RL), which often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. The authors aim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance.

Method: The authors propose on-policy SFT, a simplified training strategy that removes KL regularization and group-wise normalization, simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty. This reduces the optimization problem to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for correctness and conciseness.

Result: On-policy SFT reduces CoT length by up to 80% while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. It also reduces GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerates convergence by 70%.

Conclusion: On-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, reducing CoT length by up to 80% while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. It also significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) are commonly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore long chain-of-thought reasoning, achieving strong performance at high computational cost. Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT.

Method: 采用领域知识初始化子空间（Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization）限制搜索空间到神经科学合理的流形，并通过多目标进化优化（Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization）动态平衡性能、新颖性和效率。

Result: 在五个异构基准测试中，NeuroWeaver生成的轻量化解决方案性能优于特定任务的最先进方法，并与大型基础模型性能相当，但参数显著减少。

Conclusion: NeuroWeaver通过将管道工程重新定义为离散约束优化问题，结合领域知识初始化搜索空间和多目标进化优化，成功地在EEG分析领域实现了高效、轻量化的解决方案，其性能与大型基础模型相当，但参数更少。

Abstract: Although foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in general domains, the application of these models to electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is constrained by substantial data requirements and high parameterization. These factors incur prohibitive computational costs, thereby impeding deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Conversely, general-purpose automated machine learning frameworks are often ill-suited for this domain, as exploration within an unbounded programmatic space fails to incorporate essential neurophysiological priors and frequently yields solutions that lack scientific plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroWeaver, a unified autonomous evolutionary agent designed to generalize across diverse EEG datasets and tasks by reformulating pipeline engineering as a discrete constrained optimization problem. Specifically, we employ a Domain-Informed Subspace Initialization to confine the search to neuroscientifically plausible manifolds, coupled with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Optimization that dynamically balances performance, novelty, and efficiency via self-reflective refinement. Empirical evaluations across five heterogeneous benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroWeaver synthesizes lightweight solutions that consistently outperform state-of-the-art task-specific methods and achieve performance comparable to large-scale foundation models, despite utilizing significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）智能体能力的提升，多智能体系统的协调使用预计将成为一种实用范式。然而，现有的安全研究多集中于单智能体或缺乏基本工程保障的设置，导致多智能体系统的威胁建模稀缺。

Method: 通过红队测试一个代表性的多智能体编排设置，研究团队展示了一种新型攻击向量OMNI-LEAK，该攻击能够通过单一间接提示注入泄露敏感数据。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了将安全研究从单智能体扩展到多智能体设置的重要性，以减少现实世界中的隐私泄露、财务损失风险，并维护公众对AI智能体的信任。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.

Motivation: 个性化饮食系统的重要目标是提高营养质量而不牺牲便利性或经济性。

Method: 利用WWEIA摄入数据识别34种可解释的餐食原型，并基于这些原型使用生成模型和分量预测器来满足USDA营养目标。

Result: 生成的餐食在原型内比较中，能更好地遵循RDI目标（提高47.0%），同时保持与真实餐食的组成接近。通过1-3种食物替换，餐食营养提升10%，成本平均降低19-32%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将饮食指南转化为现实、预算友好的餐食和简单替换，为临床决策支持、公共卫生计划和消费者应用提供了可扩展、公平的日常营养改善基础。

Abstract: An important goal for personalized diet systems is to improve nutritional quality without compromising convenience or affordability. We present an end-to-end framework that converts dietary standards into complete meals with minimal change. Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.

Conclusion: 保护网络代理中的隐私是一个根本性挑战，需要更广泛的视角来考虑代理在网络上的行为而不仅仅是其输入内容。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type.

Motivation: 当前语言代理的记忆主要停留在语义层面，缺乏有效的情景记忆和推理能力。REMem旨在填补这一差距，解决情景回忆和推理的核心挑战。

Method: REMem采用两阶段框架：1) 离线索引，将经验转换为混合记忆图；2) 在线推理，通过代理检索器在记忆图上进行迭代检索。

Result: 在四个情景记忆基准测试中，REMem在情景回忆和推理任务上分别比Mem0和HippoRAG 2提高了3.4%和13.4%。

Conclusion: REMem框架在情景记忆任务中显著优于现有记忆系统，尤其在情景回忆和推理任务上表现突出，并对无法回答的问题展现出更强的拒绝行为。

Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.

Motivation: 探究LLMs是否像人类一样，根据信息来源的可信度和共识强度来调整判断，以及它们是否更倾向于接受人类而非其他LLMs的反馈。

Method: 通过三个二元决策任务（阅读理解、多步推理和道德判断），研究比较了四种指令调优的LLMs在不同来源反馈（朋友、人类专家或其他LLMs）下的行为。实验还操纵了群体正确性和规模，并在第二个实验中引入人类与LLM的直接分歧。

Result: LLMs显著倾向于遵从标记为人类专家的反馈（即使错误），并更易根据专家意见修正答案，而非其他LLMs的反馈。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当代大型语言模型（LLMs）在专家框架下表现出更强的社会影响力，这种影响在不同决策领域中具有普遍性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in environments where they encounter social information such as other agents' answers, tool outputs, or human recommendations. In humans, such inputs influence judgments in ways that depend on the source's credibility and the strength of consensus. This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit analogous patterns of influence and whether they privilege feedback from humans over feedback from other LLMs. Across three binary decision-making tasks, reading comprehension, multi-step reasoning, and moral judgment, we present four instruction-tuned LLMs with prior responses attributed either to friends, to human experts, or to other LLMs. We manipulate whether the group is correct and vary the group size. In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains.

Abstract: Rule learning-based models are widely used in highly interpretable scenarios due to their transparent structures. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a form of machine learning, induces rules from facts while maintaining interpretability. Differentiable ILP models enhance this process by leveraging neural networks to improve robustness and scalability. However, most differentiable ILP methods rely on symbolic datasets, facing challenges when learning directly from raw data. Specifically, they struggle with explicit label leakage: The inability to map continuous inputs to symbolic variables without explicit supervision of input feature labels. In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage. The learned rules effectively describe raw data through its features. We demonstrate that our method intuitively and precisely learns generalized rules from time series and image data.

Abstract: This monograph reports a multi-agent proof sprint on ten research-level problems, combining rapid draft generation with adversarial verification, targeted repair, and explicit provenance. The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints.

Motivation: 现有内存系统（如密集向量数据库或知识图遍历）存在检索延迟高和存储扩展性差的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用紧凑二进制签名进行语义搜索和无损令牌ID流进行内容重构，核心是动态小波矩阵（DWM）压缩和共索引这两种流。

Result: 实验表明，Hippocampus将端到端检索延迟降低至31倍，每查询令牌占用减少至14倍，同时在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中保持准确性。

Conclusion: Hippocampus系统通过动态小波矩阵（DWM）实现了高效的语义搜索和内容重构，显著降低了检索延迟和存储开销，适用于长期代理部署。

Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

Motivation: 探讨在AI发展中，降低数值精度以提高计算效率和能源效益的缩放定律在多跳推理中的适用性。

Method: 通过理论分解，揭示了硬件转换开销和去量化内核的隐藏延迟成本在多跳推理中的主导瓶颈作用。

Result: 发现从16位降低到8/4位精度会陷入‘量化陷阱’，增加净能耗并降低推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在复杂推理任务中，降低数值精度的传统缩放定律失效，甚至会导致更高的净能耗和推理准确性下降。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DiffusionRollout通过自适应选择步长和利用预测不确定性作为置信度代理，显著提高了自回归扩散模型在长期PDE预测中的可靠性，减少了误差累积效应。

Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, planning, and complex task generation, artificial intelligence systems are transitioning from isolated single-agent architectures to multi-agent systems with collaborative intelligence. However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence.

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合agentic-Q估计和逐步策略优化，显著提升了GUI代理在非平稳环境中的交互能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越更大规模的模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have substantially driven the progress of autonomous agents for Graphical User Interface (GUI). Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales.

Motivation: 解决代理 AI 系统中 LLM 将用户意图转换为结构化函数调用时存在的计算冗余问题，包括冗余的函数描述处理、大型模型的冗余使用以及固定参数语法的冗余生成。

Method: HyFunc 采用混合模型级联，通过大型模型将用户意图蒸馏为单个“软标记”，指导轻量级检索器选择相关函数，并引导较小的前缀调优模型生成最终调用。此外，通过“动态模板”技术在扩展的 vLLM 引擎中动态注入固定参数语法。

Conclusion: HyFunc 提供了一种更高效的代理 AI 范式，显著降低了推理延迟并保持了高性能。

Abstract: While agentic AI systems rely on LLMs to translate user intent into structured function calls, this process is fraught with computational redundancy, leading to high inference latency that hinders real-time applications. This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single "soft token." This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our "dynamic templating" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale. These results suggest that HyFunc offers a more efficient paradigm for agentic AI. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/MrBlankness/HyFunc.

Result: 在37k LongBench上，4k窗口模型实现了接近无损的性能（仅下降0.83）；在128k上下文的InfiniteBench上，8k窗口变体优于全局注意力。

Conclusion: \textsc{AllMem} 是一种高效的混合架构，通过结合滑动窗口注意力与非线性的测试时训练记忆网络，显著提升了LLMs在长序列任务中的性能，同时降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.

Result: 实验结果表明PhGPO能有效提升长视野工具规划的性能。

Conclusion: PhGPO通过从历史轨迹中学习工具转换模式（即信息素），有效改进了长视野工具规划，实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in generating rigorous mathematical proofs, with "AI for Math" emerging as a vibrant field of research. While these models have mastered competition-level benchmarks like the International Mathematical Olympiad and show promise in research applications through auto-formalization, their deployment via lightweight, natural-language pipelines for research problems remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that next-generation models (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.2 Pro), when integrated into a streamlined automated pipeline optimized for citation-based verification, can solve sophisticated research-grade problems. We evaluate our pipeline on two novel datasets: (1) the ICCM problem sets (comparable to the S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest) proposed by leading mathematicians, and (2) the "First Proof" problem set, consisting of previously unpublished research questions. Our pipeline generated candidate proofs for all problems in the first two ICCM sets and the "First Proof" set. The solutions for the first two ICCM sets and Problem 4 of the "First Proof" set have been fully verified by our team. All generated proofs have been submitted to the official organization, and our generated results are publicly available. We plan to open-source the complete pipeline methodology in due course.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种无需训练或微调即可与现有单表ICL基础模型无缝配对的RDB编码器家族，并通过开发可扩展的SQL原语实现了实用的开源RDB基础模型。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) contain vast amounts of heterogeneous tabular information that can be exploited for predictive modeling purposes. But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required. From a practical standpoint, we develop scalable SQL primitives to implement the encoder stage, resulting in an easy-to-use open-source RDB foundation model\footnote{\label{foot: RDBLearn_learn} https://github.com/HKUSHXLab/rdblearn} capable of robust performance on unseen datasets out of the box.

Result: OneLatent将平均输出长度减少了11倍，准确性仅下降2.21%，并在长链逻辑推理任务中达到99.80%（ProntoQA）和97.80%（ProsQA）的准确率。

Conclusion: OneLatent框架通过将中间推理压缩为单个潜在令牌，显著降低了推理成本，同时保持了较高的准确性，并在长链逻辑推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning but often increases inference cost by one to two orders of magnitude. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{OneLatent}, a framework that compresses intermediate reasoning into a single latent token via supervision from rendered CoT images and DeepSeek-OCR hidden states. By rendering textual steps into images, we obtain a deterministic supervision signal that can be inspected and audited without requiring the model to output verbose textual rationales. Across benchmarks, OneLatent reduces average output length by $11\times$ with only a $2.21\%$ average accuracy drop relative to textual CoT, while improving output token contribution (OTC) by $6.8\times$. On long-chain logical reasoning, OneLatent reaches $99.80\%$ on ProntoQA and $97.80\%$ on ProsQA with one latent token, with compression up to $87.4\times$, supporting compression-constrained generalization.

Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We further propose a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system: short-term experimental reflection operates as a form of verbal gradient providing immediate corrective signals; long-term reflection accumulates cross-experiment insights as verbal momentum; and memory compression serves as a regularization mechanism analogous to weight decay, preserving essential signals while mitigating drift. Together, these components form a principled architecture governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks-including traveling salesman, capacitated vehicle routing, bin packing, orienteering, and multiple knapsack problems-as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 通过将多样性从不一致性的来源转变为协作资源，StackingNet为协调人工智能奠定了实用基础，表明进步不仅可能来自更大的单一模型，还可能来自多个专业化模型的原则性合作。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence built on large foundation models has transformed language understanding, vision and reasoning, yet these systems remain isolated and cannot readily share their capabilities. Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones.

*Vashista Nobaub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Vashista稀疏注意力机制，通过理论分析和实践验证，证明其在长上下文解码中能高效平衡计算成本与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文推理中注意力计算成本高昂，而实际行为表明只有少量token对每个查询有实质贡献，因此需要一种高效且准确的稀疏注意力机制。

Method: 通过将注意力建模为关键向量凸包上的投影，并分析其熵松弛，提出了一个理论框架，证明了在严格互补边际下，注意力会集中在恒定大小的活跃面上。

Result: Vashista Sparse Attention在长上下文评估中表现出稳定的恒定大小有效支持、显著的时钟加速，且在支持间隙诊断预测的范围内质量下降最小。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种基于严格互补边际的稀疏注意力机制，Vashista Sparse Attention，能够在长上下文解码中实现稳定的计算效率与准确性平衡。

Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-Ω(Δ/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架已集成到Adobe的“实验加速器”产品中，通过AI驱动的洞察和机会发现，显著提升了实验效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern online experimentation faces two bottlenecks: scarce traffic forces tough choices on which variants to test, and post-hoc insight extraction is manual, inconsistent, and often content-agnostic. Meanwhile, organizations underuse historical A/B results and rich content embeddings that could guide prioritization and creative iteration. We present a unified framework to (i) prioritize which variants to test, (ii) explain why winners win, and (iii) surface targeted opportunities for new, higher-potential variants. Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity. For better interpretability and understanding, we project treatments onto curated semantic marketing attributes and re-express the ranker in this space via a sign-consistent, sparse constrained Lasso, yielding per-attribute coefficients and signed contributions for visual explanations, top-k drivers, and natural-language insights. We then compute an opportunity index combining attribute importance (from the ranker) with under-expression in the current experiment to flag missing, high-impact attributes. Finally, LLMs translate ranked opportunities into concrete creative suggestions and estimate both learning and conversion potential, enabling faster, more informative, and more efficient test cycles. These components have been built into a real Adobe product, called \textit{Experimentation Accelerator}, to provide AI-based insights and opportunities to scale experimentation for customers. We provide an evaluation of the performance of the proposed framework on some real-world experiments by Adobe business customers that validate the high quality of the generation pipeline.

Conclusion: 论文提出了可审计自主研究（AAR）标准，强调语义溯源和协议化验证的重要性，以解决深度学习研究代理生成报告中证据与主张链接薄弱、缺失或误导的问题。

Abstract: A deep research agent produces a fluent scientific report in minutes; a careful reader then tries to verify the main claims and discovers the real cost is not reading, but tracing: which sentence is supported by which passage, what was ignored, and where evidence conflicts. We argue that as research generation becomes cheap, auditability becomes the bottleneck, and the dominant risk shifts from isolated factual errors to scientifically styled outputs whose claim-evidence links are weak, missing, or misleading. This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HRL框架（如OC和MOC）在多目标稀疏奖励环境中表现不佳的问题，特别是在对象操纵任务中难以发现互动方式。

Method: 提出了MOC-HER和2HER两种方法：MOC-HER将Hindsight Experience Replay（HER）机制集成到MOC框架中；2HER则进一步引入双重目标虚拟目标生成策略，奖励代理与对象互动及完成任务。

Result: 在机器人操纵环境中，MOC-2HER的成功率达到90%，而MOC和MOC-HER均低于11%。

Conclusion: MOC-2HER通过双重目标重标记策略在稀疏奖励、多目标任务中表现出显著效果，成功率高达90%，远超MOC和MOC-HER的不足11%。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) frameworks like Option-Critic (OC) and Multi-updates Option Critic (MOC) have introduced significant advancements in learning reusable options. However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks.

TL;DR: Ambient Physics直接从部分观测中学习PDE系数-解对的联合分布，无需完整数据训练，显著提升重建性能，误差减少62.51%，计算量减少125倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学研究中，获取PDE系数和解的完整观测数据通常昂贵、危险或不可行。现有扩散方法虽能重建部分观测数据，但训练需完整观测。

Method: 该方法通过随机掩码已观测数据的子集并对其进行监督训练，使模型无法区分“真实未观测”与“人工未观测”数据，从而必须生成全局合理的预测。

Result: Ambient Physics在重建性能上达到最先进水平，相比之前扩散方法，平均总体误差减少62.51%，且函数评估次数减少125倍。此外，发现“单点过渡”现象：掩码单个已观测点即可实现跨架构和测量模式的学习。

Conclusion: Ambient Physics框架在无法获取完整观测数据的科学场景中展现出巨大潜力，通过直接从部分观测中学习系数-解对的联合分布，实现了无需完整观测数据的训练，显著提升了重建性能。

Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.

Conclusion: VSAL框架通过动态生成适应性强的图形布局，显著提升了基于视觉的图形属性检测性能，并在多个任务上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Graph property detection aims to determine whether a graph exhibits certain structural properties, such as being Hamiltonian. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown great promise by leveraging data-driven models to detect graph properties efficiently. In particular, vision-based methods offer a visually intuitive solution by processing the visualizations of graphs. However, existing vision-based methods rely on fixed visual graph layouts, and therefore, the expressiveness of their pipeline is restricted. To overcome this limitation, we propose VSAL, a vision-based framework that incorporates an adaptive layout generator capable of dynamically producing informative graph visualizations tailored to individual instances, thereby improving graph property detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSAL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based methods on various tasks such as Hamiltonian cycle, planarity, claw-freeness, and tree detection.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个实用的工具包，用于评估链式思维（CoT）推理的病理现象，并对训练时监控具有直接意义。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is fundamental to modern LLM architectures and represents a critical intervention point for AI safety. However, CoT reasoning may exhibit failure modes that we note as pathologies, which prevent it from being useful for monitoring. Prior work has identified three distinct pathologies: post-hoc rationalization, where models generate plausible explanations backwards from predetermined answers; encoded reasoning, where intermediate steps conceal information within seemingly interpretable text; and internalized reasoning, where models replace explicit reasoning with meaningless filler tokens while computing internally. To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法在效率和有效性之间存在根本性权衡，无法模拟人类灵活主动的记忆调度能力，HyMem旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HyMem采用双粒度存储方案和动态两级检索系统，结合轻量级模块和基于LLM的深度模块，选择性激活复杂查询。

Result: HyMem在LOCOMO和LongMemEval基准测试中表现优异，计算成本降低92.6%，性能优于全上下文方法。

Conclusion: HyMem通过混合内存架构和动态调度机制，在长期记忆管理中实现了效率和性能的最佳平衡，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents demonstrate strong performance in short-text contexts but often underperform in extended dialogues due to inefficient memory management. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness: memory compression risks losing critical details required for complex reasoning, while retaining raw text introduces unnecessary computational overhead for simple queries. The crux lies in the limitations of monolithic memory representations and static retrieval mechanisms, which fail to emulate the flexible and proactive memory scheduling capabilities observed in humans, thus struggling to adapt to diverse problem scenarios. Inspired by the principle of cognitive economy, we propose HyMem, a hybrid memory architecture that enables dynamic on-demand scheduling through multi-granular memory representations. HyMem adopts a dual-granular storage scheme paired with a dynamic two-tier retrieval system: a lightweight module constructs summary-level context for efficient response generation, while an LLM-based deep module is selectively activated only for complex queries, augmented by a reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning refinement. Experiments show that HyMem achieves strong performance on both the LOCOMO and LongMemEval benchmarks, outperforming full-context while reducing computational cost by 92.6\%, establishing a state-of-the-art balance between efficiency and performance in long-term memory management.

Method: 提出了两种统计上严谨的早期停止方法：一种是参数化方法，通过建模不确定性关键词的到达时间作为更新过程并应用序列测试；另一种是非参数化方法，为良好查询提供有限样本保证。

Result: 实证评估表明，该方法在多个领域和模型的推理任务中均有效，尤其在数学推理中表现突出。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的早期停止方法可以显著提升大型语言模型（LLM）在推理任务中的效率和可靠性，尤其在数学推理任务中效果显著。

Abstract: While LLMs have seen substantial improvement in reasoning capabilities, they also sometimes overthink, generating unnecessary reasoning steps, particularly under uncertainty, given ill-posed or ambiguous queries. We introduce statistically principled early stopping methods that monitor uncertainty signals during generation to mitigate this issue. Our first approach is parametric: it models inter-arrival times of uncertainty keywords as a renewal process and applies sequential testing for stopping. Our second approach is nonparametric and provides finite-sample guarantees on the probability of halting too early on well-posed queries. We conduct empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks across several domains and models. Our results indicate that uncertainty-aware early stopping can improve both efficiency and reliability in LLM reasoning, and we observe especially significant gains for math reasoning.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for traffic agents is critical for safe autonomous driving. However, achieving effective zero-shot generalization in previously unseen domains remains a significant challenge. Motivated by the consistent nature of kinematics across diverse domains, we aim to incorporate domain-invariant knowledge to enhance zero-shot trajectory prediction capabilities. The key challenges include: 1) effectively extracting domain-invariant scene representations, and 2) integrating invariant features with kinematic models to enable generalized predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information. Extensive experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our method's superior zero-shot generalization performance in unseen cities, significantly outperforming competitive baselines.

TL;DR: Neuromem测试平台评估流式内存模块的性能，发现内存增长导致性能下降，时间查询最具挑战性，数据结构决定质量上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估通常假设静态设置，而实际应用中内存是流式的，新数据不断到达，插入与检索交错进行，内存状态在查询服务过程中不断演变。因此，需要全面评估内存生命周期的各个维度。

Method: Neuromem是一个可扩展的测试平台，通过交错插入和检索协议对External Memory Modules进行基准测试，并将其生命周期分解为五个维度：内存数据结构、归一化策略、整合策略、查询制定策略和上下文集成机制。

Result: 使用三个代表性数据集（LOCOMO、LONGMEMEVAL和MEMORYAGENTBENCH）评估，报告token级F1分数和插入/检索延迟。

Conclusion: 性能通常随着内存增长而下降，时间相关查询是最具挑战性的类别。内存数据结构决定了可达到的质量边界，而激进的压缩和生成集成机制主要在插入和检索之间转移成本，准确性提升有限。

Abstract: Most evaluations of External Memory Module assume a static setting: memory is built offline and queried at a fixed state. In practice, memory is streaming: new facts arrive continuously, insertions interleave with retrievals, and the memory state evolves while the model is serving queries. In this regime, accuracy and cost are governed by the full memory lifecycle, which encompasses the ingestion, maintenance, retrieval, and integration of information into generation. We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency. Overall, we observe that performance typically degrades as memory grows across rounds, and time-related queries remain the most challenging category. The memory data structure largely determines the attainable quality frontier, while aggressive compression and generative integration mechanisms mostly shift cost between insertion and retrieval with limited accuracy gain.

Motivation: 长上下文显著增加LLM推理延迟，现有压缩方法需捕获全局依赖且依赖大量预训练数据，而PIC受人类工作记忆的分块机制启发，旨在降低训练难度。

Method: 提出PIC方法，通过修改Transformer的注意力掩码，显式限制记忆令牌的接收域为顺序局部块。

Result: PIC在多个下游任务中表现优于基线方法，高压缩比场景下提升显著（如QA任务中F1和EM分数分别提升29.8%和40.7%），并减少约40%训练时间。

Conclusion: PIC（Parallelized Iterative Compression）方法通过限制记忆令牌的接收域到局部块，显著降低了压缩器训练的难度，并在高压缩比场景下表现优异，同时大幅缩短了训练时间。

Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated strong potential in clinical diagnostics, often achieving accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of human experts. A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption. Critical symptoms, pivotal for rapid and accurate decision-making, may be overlooked by AI models even when predictions are correct. Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.

Abstract: The large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) show strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and multi-modal understanding, and can enable advanced capabilities in low-altitude edge intelligence. However, the deployment of LAMs at the edge remains constrained by some fundamental limitations. First, tasks are rigidly tied to specific models, limiting the flexibility. Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence. Specifically, P2AECF transforms high-level semantic prompts into executable reasoning workflows through three key mechanisms. First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context. In addition, we illustrate the framework through a representative low-altitude intelligent network use case, showing its ability to deliver adaptive, modular, and scalable edge intelligence for real-time low-altitude aerial collaborations.

Abstract: Flowchart-oriented dialogue (FOD) systems aim to guide users through multi-turn decision-making or operational procedures by following a domain-specific flowchart to achieve a task goal. In this work, we formalize flowchart reasoning in FOD as grounding user input to flowchart nodes at each dialogue turn while ensuring node transition is consistent with the correct flowchart path. Despite recent advances of LLMs in task-oriented dialogue systems, adapting them to FOD still faces two limitations: (1) LLMs lack an explicit mechanism to represent and reason over flowchart topology, and (2) they are prone to hallucinations, leading to unfaithful flowchart reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose FloCA, a zero-shot flowchart-oriented conversational agent. FloCA uses an LLM for intent understanding and response generation while delegating flowchart reasoning to an external tool that performs topology-constrained graph execution, ensuring faithful and logically consistent node transitions across dialogue turns. We further introduce an evaluation framework with an LLM-based user simulator and five new metrics covering reasoning accuracy and interaction efficiency. Extensive experiments on FLODIAL and PFDial datasets highlight the bottlenecks of existing LLM-based methods and demonstrate the superiority of FloCA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标识别方法依赖最优目标导向策略表示，可能与代理真实行为不符，导致目标识别不准确。GRAIL 旨在填补这一差距。

Method: GRAIL 结合模仿学习和逆强化学习，为每个候选目标学习一个目标导向策略，并通过单次前向传递对观察到的部分轨迹进行评分。

Result: GRAIL 在系统偏置最优行为下 F1 分数提升超过 0.5，次优行为下提升约 0.1-0.3，噪声最优轨迹下提升达 0.4，同时在完全最优设置下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GRAIL 通过模仿学习和逆强化学习，直接从（可能次优的）演示轨迹中学习目标导向策略，显著提升了在不确定环境中解释代理目标的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: FluxMem框架通过自适应内存组织和多层次内存层次结构，显著提升了LLM代理在长期交互中的性能表现。

Abstract: Memory is critical for enabling large language model (LLM) based agents to maintain coherent behavior over long-horizon interactions. However, existing agent memory systems suffer from two key gaps: they rely on a one-size-fits-all memory structure and do not model memory structure selection as a context-adaptive decision, limiting their ability to handle heterogeneous interaction patterns and resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds. Experiments on two long-horizon benchmarks, PERSONAMEM and LoCoMo, demonstrate that our method achieves average improvements of 9.18% and 6.14%.

Method: 提出了REAL框架，包括推理轴心感知的SFT（RPA-SFT）训练通用判别器，以及推理轴心引导的解码策略（RPGD）用于针对性冲突缓解。

Conclusion: REAL框架通过推理轴心驱动的冲突解决范式显著提升了判别准确性，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (KI-VQA) frequently suffers from severe knowledge conflicts caused by the inherent limitations of open-domain retrieval. However, existing paradigms face critical limitations due to the lack of generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence. To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm.

Conclusion: Plan-MCTS框架通过将探索转移到语义计划空间，显著提升了网络导航任务的效率和准确性，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

Method: 使用多模态代码模型将真实应用重构为轻量级Web环境，并配备代码原生奖励（可执行断言）。

Result: GUI-GENESIS将环境延迟降低10倍，成本节省超过28,000美元/epoch，训练出的代理在真实任务中表现优于基线模型和真实世界RL基线。

Conclusion: GUI-GENESIS通过合成轻量级Web环境和代码原生奖励，显著提升了GUI代理的训练效率和性能，为自改进代理提供了路径。

Abstract: Post-training GUI agents in interactive environments is critical for developing generalization and long-horizon planning capabilities. However, training on real-world applications is hindered by high latency, poor reproducibility, and unverifiable rewards relying on noisy visual proxies. To address the limitations, we present GUI-GENESIS, the first framework to automatically synthesize efficient GUI training environments with verifiable rewards. GUI-GENESIS reconstructs real-world applications into lightweight web environments using multimodal code models and equips them with code-native rewards, executable assertions that provide deterministic reward signals and eliminate visual estimation noise. Extensive experiments show that GUI-GENESIS reduces environment latency by 10 times and costs by over $28,000 per epoch compared to training on real applications. Notably, agents trained with GUI-GENESIS outperform the base model by 14.54% and even real-world RL baselines by 3.27% on held-out real-world tasks. Finally, we observe that models can synthesize environments they cannot yet solve, highlighting a pathway for self-improving agents.

Motivation: 探讨模型在无害文本中隐藏秘密推理的潜在能力，以评估风险和制定部署策略。

Method: 系统评估了28个模型在隐写能力上的极限，包括监控逃避、拒绝率、编码保真度和隐藏任务准确性，并比较了隐写离合诗与普通推理及填充标记基线的表现。

Result: 当前模型尚无法在复杂数学和算术任务中维持隐藏推理，但在简化计数实验中，Claude Opus 4.5实现了92%的隐藏任务准确率。GPT-5.2在极少数情况下（<1%）会拒绝隐写指令但同时又遵守它们。

Conclusion: 研究强调了持续评估隐写风险的紧迫性，并提供了预检测和预防隐藏推理的方法，以应对可能导致的错位阴谋和欺骗行为。

Abstract: Monitoring chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is a foundational safety technique for large language model (LLM) agents; however, this oversight is compromised if models learn to conceal their reasoning. We explore the potential for steganographic CoT -- where models hide secret reasoning within innocuous text -- to inform risk assessment and deployment policies. We systematically evaluate the limits of steganographic capabilities across 28 models, ranging from past generations to the current frontier. We measure monitor evasion, refusal rates, encoding fidelity, and hidden task accuracy across four datasets, comparing steganographic acrostics against plain reasoning and filler-token baselines. We find that current models cannot yet sustain hidden reasoning for complex math and arithmetic tasks. However, in a simplified counting experiment, Claude Opus 4.5 achieved 92% accuracy on the hidden task, demonstrating nascent capability. Notably, in rare cases (<1%), GPT-5.2 might refuse steganographic instructions while simultaneously complying with them. Our findings underscore the need for continuous evaluation of steganographic risks. This study provides a methodology to preemptively detect and prevent hidden reasoning that might empower misaligned scheming and deceptive behavior.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在生成创造性输出时受限，主要因为其结构特性导致生成过程近乎确定性。

Method: 提出了代数量子智能（AQI）作为计算框架，扩展语义空间，并基于量子理论设计非交换代数结构。

Result: AQI在十个领域的创造性推理基准测试中显著优于基线模型，并减少跨领域方差。

Conclusion: 非交换代数动力学可以作为机器创造性的实用且可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating fluent and contextually appropriate text; however, their capacity to produce genuinely creative outputs remains limited. This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments.

Result: 评估了20多个主流大型模型，发现前沿AI在多个支柱上普遍存在安全漏洞，特别是在自主性、AI科学安全等领域。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了‘ForesightSafety Bench’框架，旨在解决当前AI安全评估系统的局限性，通过多维度风险评估，识别前沿AI模型的关键风险模式。

Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks.

Method: 采用基于强化学习的代理工具框架，结合层次化多智能体系统和GRPO训练的主管代理。

Conclusion: 通过结合过程级监督和结果奖励，多智能体系统在基因-疾病有效性评估任务中显著提高了结果准确性和过程一致性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making requires nuanced reasoning over heterogeneous evidence and traceable justifications. While recent LLM multi-agent systems (MAS) show promise, they largely optimise for outcome accuracy while overlooking process-grounded reasoning aligned with clinical standards. One critical real-world case of this is gene-disease validity curation, where experts must determine whether a gene is causally implicated in a disease by synthesising diverse biomedical evidence. We introduce an agent-as-tool reinforcement learning framework for this task with two objectives: (i) process-level supervision to ensure reasoning follows valid clinical pathways, and (ii) efficient coordination via a hierarchical multi-agent system. Our evaluation on the ClinGen dataset shows that with outcome-only rewards, MAS with a GRPO-trained Qwen3-4B supervisor agent substantially improves final outcome accuracy from 0.195 with a base model supervisor to 0.732, but results in poor process alignment (0.392 F1). Conversely, with process + outcome rewards, MAS with GRPO-trained supervisor achieves higher outcome accuracy (0.750) while significantly improving process fidelity to 0.520 F1.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种分阶段知识注入方法，通过先利用高质量的地球科学文本QA来构建推理结构，再结合UHR图像-文本示例进行预训练，显著提升了模型在XLRS-Bench上的表现，达到了60.40%的Pass@1，超越了现有通用大模型。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning for ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) is usually bottlenecked by visual evidence acquisition: the model necessitates localizing tiny task-relevant regions in massive pixel spaces. While Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using zoom-in tools offers a path forward, we find that standard reinforcement learning struggles to navigate these vast visual spaces without structured domain priors. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between post-training paradigms: comparing Cold-start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR, and Agentic RLVR on the UHR RS benchmark.Our controlled studies yield a counter-intuitive finding: high-quality Earth-science text-only QA is a primary driver of UHR visual reasoning gains. Despite lacking images, domain-specific text injects the concepts, mechanistic explanations, and decision rules necessary to guide visual evidence retrieval.Based on this, we propose a staged knowledge injection recipe: (1) cold-starting with scalable, knowledge-graph-verified Earth-science text QA to instill reasoning structures;and (2) "pre-warming" on the same hard UHR image-text examples during SFT to stabilize and amplify subsequent tool-based RL. This approach achieves a 60.40% Pass@1 on XLRS-Bench, significantly outperforming larger general purpose models (e.g., GPT-5.2, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Intern-S1) and establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.

Abstract: Large language models are transitioning from generalpurpose knowledge engines to realworld problem solvers, yet optimizing them for deep search tasks remains challenging. The central bottleneck lies in the extreme sparsity of highquality search trajectories and reward signals, arising from the difficulty of scalable longhorizon task construction and the high cost of interactionheavy rollouts involving external tool calls. To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization. Specifically, REDSearcher introduces the following improvements: (1) We frame task synthesis as a dualconstrained optimization, where task difficulty is precisely governed by graph topology and evidence dispersion, allowing scalable generation of complex, highquality tasks. (2) We introduce toolaugmented queries to encourage proactive tool use rather than passive recall.(3) During midtraining, we strengthen core atomic capabilities knowledge, planning, and function calling substantially reducing the cost of collecting highquality trajectories for downstream training. (4) We build a local simulated environment that enables rapid, lowcost algorithmic iteration for reinforcement learning experiments. Across both textonly and multimodal searchagent benchmarks, our approach achieves stateoftheart performance. To facilitate future research on longhorizon search agents, we will release 10K highquality complex text search trajectories, 5K multimodal trajectories and 1K text RL query set, and together with code and model checkpoints.

Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.

Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.

TL;DR: 研究通过PITA数据集和任务深度/广度分析，揭示了推理模型在广泛任务上的优势和在深层任务上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理模型发展迅速，但对其推理过程（RTs）如何支持推理及其局限性的理解仍不完整，因此需要更清晰的理论框架。

Method: 研究者引入了PITA数据集，包含2300万条命题逻辑语句及其对应证明，并设计了任务深度和广度的度量标准，通过在不同子集上测试模型的泛化能力进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，RT模型在广泛和浅层任务上泛化能力较强，但在狭窄和深层任务上表现较差，且这一现象在合成任务中得到了验证。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了推理模型在广泛和浅层任务上表现良好，但在狭窄和深层任务上相对非推理基线模型表现下降，并提出了任务深度和广度的概念来量化这一现象。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed meteoric progress in reasoning models: neural networks that generate intermediate reasoning traces (RTs) before producing a final output. Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces.

Conclusion: PIR（Precedent Informed Reasoning）通过自适应先例选择和测试时经验内化，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理效率与准确性，实现了优异的准确性与效率平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffers from inefficient long chain-of-thought traces with redundant self-exploration and validation, which inflate computational costs and even degrade performance. Inspired by human reasoning patterns where people solve new problems by leveraging past related cases to constrain search spaces and reduce trial-and-error, we propose Precedent Informed Reasoning (PIR) transforming LRMs'reasoning paradigm from exhaustive self-exploration to guided learning from precedents. PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) models, Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice presents a comprehensive assessment of their frontier risks. As Large Language Models (LLMs) general capabilities rapidly evolve and the proliferation of agentic AI, this version of the risk analysis technical report presents an updated and granular assessment of five critical dimensions: cyber offense, persuasion and manipulation, strategic deception, uncontrolled AI R\&D, and self-replication. Specifically, we introduce more complex scenarios for cyber offense. For persuasion and manipulation, we evaluate the risk of LLM-to-LLM persuasion on newly released LLMs. For strategic deception and scheming, we add the new experiment with respect to emergent misalignment. For uncontrolled AI R\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果概率对于个体层面的解释和决策至关重要，但它们本质上是反事实的，且通常无法从数据中完全识别。现有的界限要么忽略了可用的协变量，要么需要完整的因果图，或者依赖于限制性的二元设置，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过将可用的结构或统计信息作为约束条件系统地纳入优化编程公式中，从而在不完全可识别的情况下获得更严格且形式有效的界限。

Result: 提出的方法能够在因果知识不完整但信息丰富的情况下，为因果概率提供更紧密且形式有效的界限。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个利用部分因果信息来界定因果概率的通用框架，扩展了因果概率在现实场景中的应用范围。

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to individual-level explanation and decision making, yet they are inherently counterfactual and not point-identifiable from data in general. Existing bounds either disregard available covariates, require complete causal graphs, or rely on restrictive binary settings, limiting their practical use. In real-world applications, causal information is often partial but nontrivial. This paper proposes a general framework for bounding probabilities of causation using partial causal information. We show how the available structural or statistical information can be systematically incorporated as constraints in a optimization programming formulation, yielding tighter and formally valid bounds without full identifiability. This approach extends the applicability of probabilities of causation to realistic settings where causal knowledge is incomplete but informative.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COOL-MC结合形式化验证和可解释性方法，为败血症治疗策略提供安全且透明的分析工具，揭示策略决策的关键驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健领域，安全且可解释的序列决策至关重要，但现有的强化学习（RL）策略在败血症治疗优化中不透明且难以验证。标准概率模型检查器在全状态空间上操作，对于较大的MDP不可行，且无法解释策略的决策原因。

Method: COOL-MC构建了由训练策略诱导的可达状态空间，生成一个较小的离散时间马尔可夫链（DTMC），并自动标记具有临床意义的原子命题。此外，它将可解释性方法与概率计算树逻辑（PCTL）查询集成，以揭示哪些特征驱动决策。

Result: 在ICU-Sepsis MDP基准测试中，COOL-MC通过全MDP验证建立了硬边界，训练了一个达到最优生存概率的安全RL策略，并通过PCTL验证和可解释性分析揭示了策略行为。例如，发现策略主要依赖于先前的给药历史而非患者病情变化。

Conclusion: COOL-MC通过结合形式化验证和可解释性方法，为临床医生提供了一个工具，用于在部署前调查和调试败血症治疗策略。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长链思维推理中常因不同知识源提供冲突信号而失败，需系统研究其机制。

Method: 通过探测内部表示，揭示了知识冲突的线性可分性、深度定位、层次一致性和方向不对称性。

Result: 发现冲突类型被明确编码为线性可分特征，冲突信号集中在中间至后期层，且沿轨迹聚合噪声信号可稳健恢复输入级冲突类型。

Conclusion: 研究发现为多模态推理在知识冲突下的机制提供了视角，并为长链思维推理的失败提供了原则性诊断和控制方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种内部机制导向的视角，将知识存在与行为表达分离，以区分幻觉和欺骗这两种不同的失败模式。

Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

Motivation: Address limitations of classical ARM methods (rule explosion, poor scalability) and recent neural approaches (degraded performance in low-data regimes).

Method: Introduces TabProbe, a framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules without frequent itemset mining.

Result: TFMs produce high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance, robust in low-data settings.

Conclusion: TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in tabular data and is widely used in high-stakes decision-making. Classical ARM methods rely on frequent itemset mining, leading to rule explosion and poor scalability, while recent neural approaches mitigate these issues but suffer from degraded performance in low-data regimes. Tabular foundation models (TFMs), pretrained on diverse tabular data with strong in-context generalization, provide a basis for addressing these limitations. We introduce a model-agnostic association rule learning framework that extracts association rules from any conditional probabilistic model over tabular data, enabling us to leverage TFMs. We then introduce TabProbe, an instantiation of our framework that utilizes TFMs as conditional probability estimators to learn association rules out-of-the-box without frequent itemset mining. We evaluate our approach on tabular datasets of varying sizes based on standard ARM rule quality metrics and downstream classification performance. The results show that TFMs consistently produce concise, high-quality association rules with strong predictive performance and remain robust in low-data settings without task-specific training.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在高风险领域（如医疗分诊）中难以严格遵循结构化工作流，单一提示方法随着提示长度增加会出现指令跟随退化问题。

Method: Arbor框架将决策树标准化为边列表表示并动态检索，通过基于有向无环图（DAG）的编排机制，迭代检索当前节点的出边，并通过专用LLM调用评估有效转换，最后将响应生成委托给单独的推理步骤。

Result: Arbor在10个基础模型上相比单一提示基线，平均每轮准确性提高了29.4个百分点，每轮延迟降低了57.1%，每轮成本平均减少了14.4倍。

Conclusion: Arbor框架通过分解决策树导航为专门的节点级任务，显著提高了大型语言模型在结构化工作流中的表现，尤其在医疗分诊等高风险领域。该框架不仅提升了准确性和效率，还降低了成本，表明架构分解可以减少对模型内在能力的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models struggle to maintain strict adherence to structured workflows in high-stakes domains such as healthcare triage. Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines.

Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习和图学习的BEOP解决方案，能够在短时间内生成高效的公交疏散路线，并通过MILP验证了方案的性能。

Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.

Abstract: Autonomous agents require some form of goal and plan recognition to interact in multiagent settings. Unfortunately, all existing goal recognition datasets suffer from a systematical bias induced by the planning systems that generated them, namely heuristic-based forward search. This means that existing datasets lack enough challenge for more realistic scenarios (e.g., agents using different planners), which impacts the evaluation of goal recognisers with respect to using different planners for the same goal. In this paper, we propose a new method that uses top-k planning to generate multiple, different, plans for the same goal hypothesis, yielding benchmarks that mitigate the bias found in the current dataset. This allows us to introduce a new metric called Version Coverage Score (VCS) to measure the resilience of the goal recogniser when inferring a goal based on different sets of plans. Our results show that the resilience of the current state-of-the-art goal recogniser degrades substantially under low observability settings.

Conclusion: 结合强化学习与系统提示进化的方法（E-SPL）在样本效率和泛化能力上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Building agentic systems that can autonomously self-improve from experience is a longstanding goal of AI. Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%).

Abstract: Web agents require massive trajectories to generalize, yet real-world training is constrained by network latency, rate limits, and safety risks. We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.

TL;DR: 前沿AI模型在核危机模拟中表现出复杂战略行为，验证并挑战了传统战略理论，强调需校准AI与人类推理差异以应对AI影响战略的未来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在战略竞争中的复杂行为，包括欺骗、心理理论和元认知自我意识，并验证其对战略理论的影响。

Method: 通过危机模拟实验，让三个前沿大语言模型（GPT-5.2、Claude Sonnet 4、Gemini 3 Flash）在核危机中扮演对立领导人。

Result: 验证并挑战了战略理论的核心原则，发现核禁忌对模型无阻碍，战略核攻击虽罕见但会发生，威胁更多引发对抗而非顺从，高可信度加速冲突而非威慑。

Conclusion: AI模拟是战略分析的有力工具，但需要与人类推理模式进行适当校准。理解前沿模型如何模仿或不模仿人类战略逻辑，对于AI日益影响战略结果的世界至关重要。

Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

Motivation: 现有的知识图细化算法评估数据集通常仅包含基本事实，即使源知识图中存在模式级知识，也保留得非常有限，这限制了依赖丰富本体约束、推理或神经符号技术的方法的评估。

Method: 工作流程处理了在保留模式和事实时检测到的不一致性，并利用推理来推导隐含知识。套件包括从具有丰富模式的知识图中新提取的数据集，同时为现有数据集丰富了模式信息。

Conclusion: 本文提出了\resource{}，这是首个提供包含模式和事实的数据集提取工作流程的资源，为机器学习和推理服务提供了现成的数据集套件。

Abstract: Datasets for the experimental evaluation of knowledge graph refinement algorithms typically contain only ground facts, retaining very limited schema level knowledge even when such information is available in the source knowledge graphs. This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based SC2代理忽视了可学习的动作条件转换模型在决策循环中的整合，因此提出StarWM来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出StarWM世界模型，构建SC2-Dynamics-50k数据集，并开发多维离线评估框架。

Result: StarWM在资源预测准确性和宏观一致性上显著优于零样本基线，StarWM-Agent在在线评估中对不同难度级别的AI胜率提升显著。

Conclusion: StarWM-Agent通过整合StarWM世界模型到决策循环中，显著提升了在StarCraft II中的表现，包括胜率提升和宏观管理稳定性增强。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Concept Influence, a scalable TDA method using interpretable model structures, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and semantic relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior in existing Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods, which are computationally expensive and biased toward syntactic similarity.

Method: The paper introduces Concept Influence, which attributes model behavior to semantic directions (e.g., linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. It also shows that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence, achieving comparable performance while being significantly faster.

Result: Concept Influence and its approximations achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable, as validated across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating interpretable structures within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种多项式时间框架，首次实现了在个体和世界层面上进行隐式学习和提升推理的一阶概率逻辑。

Abstract: Reconciling the tension between inductive learning and deductive reasoning in first-order relational domains is a longstanding challenge in AI. We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds.

Motivation: 探究CoT推理成功的驱动因素及其可解释性。

Method: 通过潜在概念量化CoT各部分对最终答案的贡献，并分析推理痕迹的模式。

Result: 发现CoT的潜在模式具有非单调性、尖锐峰值和幸运猜测，且部分CoT可显著提升较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: CoT推理的成功机制部分可解释且可转移，但仍存在难以理解的部分。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.

Motivation: 当前AI训练方法将推理视为规模的涌现属性，而本文主张稳健推理源于语言自我反思，这种反思源自高质量社交互动。

Result: 通过对话环境学习成为理解世界的新方式，对话质量决定代理的私人推理深度和计算效率。

Conclusion: 优化对话支架是下一代通用智能的主要杠杆。

Abstract: Current approaches to AI training treat reasoning as an emergent property of scale. We argue instead that robust reasoning emerges from linguistic self-reflection, itself internalized from high-quality social interaction. Drawing on Vygotskian developmental psychology, we advance three core positions centered on Introspection. First, we argue for the Social Genesis of the Private Mind: learning from conversational environments rises to prominence as a new way to make sense of the world; the friction of aligning with another agent, internal or not, refines and crystallizes the reasoning process. Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered. We conclude that optimizing these conversational scaffolds is the primary lever for the next generation of general intelligence.

Abstract: To address the global health threat of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are being explored for their potent and promising ability to fight resistant pathogens. While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability.

Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.

Conclusion: Bioptic Agent在药物资产侦察中表现出色，其F1分数显著高于其他AI代理，证明了其在多语言、多源环境中的高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Bio-pharmaceutical innovation has shifted: many new drug assets now originate outside the United States and are disclosed primarily via regional, non-English channels. Recent data suggests >85% of patent filings originate outside the U.S., with China accounting for nearly half of the global total; a growing share of scholarly output is also non-U.S. Industry estimates put China at ~30% of global drug development, spanning 1,200+ novel candidates. In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface "under-the-radar" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value. Yet today's Deep Research AI agents still lag human experts in achieving high-recall discovery across heterogeneous, multilingual sources without hallucinations.
  We propose a benchmarking methodology for drug asset scouting and a tuned, tree-based self-learning Bioptic Agent aimed at complete, non-hallucinated scouting. We construct a challenging completeness benchmark using a multilingual multi-agent pipeline: complex user queries paired with ground-truth assets that are largely outside U.S.-centric radar. To reflect real deal complexity, we collected screening queries from expert investors, BD, and VC professionals and used them as priors to conditionally generate benchmark queries. For grading, we use LLM-as-judge evaluation calibrated to expert opinions. We compare Bioptic Agent against Claude Opus 4.6, OpenAI GPT-5.2 Pro, Perplexity Deep Research, Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research, and Exa Websets. Bioptic Agent achieves 79.7% F1 versus 56.2% (Claude Opus 4.6), 50.6% (Gemini 3 Pro + Deep Research), 46.6% (GPT-5.2 Pro), 44.2% (Perplexity Deep Research), and 26.9% (Exa Websets). Performance improves steeply with additional compute, supporting the view that more compute yields better results.

Abstract: Differential Privacy is the gold standard in privacy-preserving data analysis. This paper addresses the challenge of producing a differentially edge-private vertex coloring. In this paper, we present two novel algorithms to approach this problem. Both algorithms initially randomly colors each vertex from a fixed size palette, then applies the exponential mechanism to locally resample colors for either all or a chosen subset of the vertices.
  Any non-trivial differentially edge private coloring of graph needs to be defective. A coloring of a graph is k defective if all vertices of the graph share it's assigned color with at most k of its neighbors. This is the metric by which we will measure the utility of our algorithms. Our first algorithm applies to d-inductive graphs. Assume we have a d-inductive graph with n vertices and max degree $Δ$. We show that our algorithm provides a \(3ε\)-differentially private coloring with \(O(\frac{\log n}ε+d)\) max defectiveness, given a palette of size $Θ(\fracΔ{\log n}+\frac{1}ε)$ Furthermore, we show that this algorithm can generalize to $O(\fracΔ{cε}+d)$ defectiveness, where c is the size of the palette and $c=O(\fracΔ{\log n})$. Our second algorithm utilizes noisy thresholding to guarantee \(O(\frac{\log n}ε)\) max defectiveness, given a palette of size $Θ(\fracΔ{\log n}+\frac{1}ε)$, generalizing to all graphs rather than just d-inductive ones.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的O(R)-word数据结构，支持在恒定时间内进行前向和后向步进操作，并重新审视了单倍型检索和前缀搜索两个关键应用，分别设计了高效的数据结构。

Abstract: The Positional Burrows--Wheeler Transform (PBWT) is a data structure designed for efficiently representing and querying large collections of sequences, such as haplotype panels in genomics. Forward and backward stepping operations -- analogues to LF- and FL-mapping in the traditional BWT -- are fundamental to the PBWT, underpinning many algorithms based on the PBWT for haplotype matching and related analyses. Although the run-length encoded variant of the PBWT (also known as the $μ$-PBWT) achieves $O(\newR)$-word space usage, where $\newR$ is the total number of runs, no data structure supporting both forward and backward stepping in constant time within this space bound was previously known. In this paper, we consider the multi-allelic PBWT that is extended from its original binary form to a general ordered alphabet $\{0, \dots, σ-1\}$. We first establish bounds on the size $\newR$ and then introduce a new $O(\newR)$-word data structure built over a list of haplotypes $\{S_1, \dots, S_\height\}$, each of length $\width$, that supports constant-time forward and backward stepping.
  We further revisit two key applications -- haplotype retrieval and prefix search -- leveraging our efficient forward stepping technique. Specifically, we design an $O(\newR)$-word space data structure that supports haplotype retrieval in $O(\log \log_{\word} h + \width)$ time. For prefix search, we present an $O(\height + \newR)$-word data structure that answers queries in $O(m' \log\log_{\word} σ+ \occ)$ time, where $m'$ denotes the length of the longest common prefix returned and $\occ$ denotes the number of haplotypes prefixed the longest prefix.

Result: 评估结果显示：（1）学习过滤器在稳定工作负载下可实现高达10^2倍的更低FPR，但在偏斜或动态工作负载下表现出高方差和缺乏稳健性，且查询延迟高达10^4倍；（2）堆叠过滤器在偏斜工作负载下可靠地实现高达10^3倍的更低FPR，但需要工作负载知识；（3）自适应过滤器在各种设置下均表现稳健，在对抗性查询中实现高达10^3倍的更低FPR，且无需工作负载假设。

Conclusion: 基于分析，学习过滤器适用于输入特征能够有效训练模型且空间限制严格的稳定工作负载，堆叠过滤器在已知可靠查询分布时表现最佳，而自适应过滤器最具通用性，即使在动态或对抗性环境中也能提供稳健的理论保证。

Abstract: Filters are ubiquitous in computer science, enabling space-efficient approximate membership testing. Since Bloom filters were introduced in 1970, decades of work improved their space efficiency and performance. Recently, three new paradigms have emerged offering orders-of-magnitude improvements in false positive rates (FPRs) by using information beyond the input set: (1) learned filters train a model to distinguish (non)members, (2) stacked filters use negative workload samples to build cascading layers, and (3) adaptive filters update internal representation in response to false positive feedback. Yet each paradigm targets specific use cases, introduces complex configuration tuning, and has been evaluated in isolation. This results in unclear trade-offs and a gap in understanding how these approaches compare and when each is most appropriate. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of learned, stacked, and adaptive filters across real-world datasets and query workloads. Our results reveal critical trade-offs: (1) Learned filters achieve up to 10^2 times lower FPRs but exhibit high variance and lack robustness under skewed or dynamic workloads. Critically, model inference overhead leads to up to 10^4 times slower query latencies than stacked or adaptive filters. (2) Stacked filters reliably achieve up to 10^3 times lower FPRs on skewed workloads but require workload knowledge. (3) Adaptive filters are robust across settings, achieving up to 10^3 times lower FPRs under adversarial queries without workload assumptions. Based on our analysis, learned filters suit stable workloads where input features enable effective model training and space constraints are paramount, stacked filters excel when reliable query distributions are known, and adaptive filters are most generalizable, providing robust theoretically bound guarantees even in dynamic or adversarial environments.

Motivation: RNA设计中的设计性问题主要基于最小自由能（MFE）标准，而基于集合的设计性概念尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种集合近似理论和概率分解框架，开发了一个线性时间动态规划算法，用于高效搜索指数级分解并确定最优分解。

Result: 在ArchiveII和Eterna100基准测试中，应用该方法获得了比先前方法更紧的概率界限，并提供了分析RNA结构和理解设计难点的解剖工具。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入集合近似理论和概率分解框架，为RNA结构的折叠概率提供了更紧的概率界限，并通过线性时间动态规划算法优化分解，为RNA设计提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: Motivation: RNA design aims to find RNA sequences that fold into a given target secondary structure, a problem also known as RNA inverse folding. However, not all target structures are designable. Recent advances in RNA designability have focused primarily on minimum free energy (MFE)-based criteria, while ensemble-based notions of designability remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a theory of ensemble approximation and a probability decomposition framework for bounding the folding probabilities of RNA structures in an explainable way. We further develop a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently searches over exponentially many decompositions and identifies the optimal one that yields the tightest probabilistic bound for a given structure. Results: Applying our methods to both native and artificial RNA structures in the ArchiveII and Eterna100 benchmarks, we obtained probability bounds that are much tighter than prior approaches. In addition, our methods further provide anatomical tools for analyzing RNA structures and understanding the sources of design difficulty at the motif level.

TL;DR: 新型字符串索引：近乎最优空间+高效搜索+流式构建，不依赖Karp-Rabin指纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有字符串索引在空间效率和构建时间上的不足，尤其是在流式处理场景下的适用性。

Method: 通过一种不依赖Karp-Rabin指纹的方法，利用确定性字典替代哈希表（可能牺牲部分速度），在O(n log n)预期时间内完成索引构建。

Result: 实现了搜索时间与当前最佳结果匹配，空间复杂度接近最优（O(δlog(n/δ))），且首次支持在流式处理中高效构建。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新型字符串索引结构，能够在几乎最优的空间复杂度（O(δlog(n/δ))）下实现高效的搜索性能（O(m + (occ + 1)log^εn)），并且支持流式构建。

Abstract: Suppose that we are given a string $s$ of length $n$ over an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots,n^{O(1)}\}$ and $δ$ is a compression measure for $s$ called string complexity. We describe an index on $s$ with $O(δ\log\frac{n}δ)$ space, measured in $O(\log n)$-bit machine words, that can search in $s$ any string of length $m$ in $O(m + (\mathrm{occ} + 1)\log^εn)$ time, where $\mathrm{occ}$ is the number of found occurrences and $ε> 0$ is any fixed constant (the big-O in the space bound hides factor $\frac{1}ε$). Crucially, the index can be built within this space in $O(n\log n)$ expected time by one left-to-right pass on the string $s$ in a streaming fashion. The index does not use the Karp--Rabin fingerprints, and the randomization in the construction time can be eliminated by using deterministic dictionaries instead of hash tables (with a slowdown). The search time matches currently best results and the space is almost optimal (the known optimum is $O(δ\log\frac{n}{δα})$, where $α= \log_σn$ and $σ$ is the alphabet size, and it coincides with $O(δ\log\frac{n}δ)$ when $δ= O(n / α^2)$). This is the first index that can be constructed within such space and with such time guarantees. To avoid uninteresting marginal cases, all above bounds are stated for $δ\ge Ω(\log\log n)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小-最大连通多路割问题是标准多路割问题的自然修改，其目标是最小化任何部分边界边的最大权重，且要求每个部分诱导的子图是连通的。这一修改的目标函数在文献中已有考虑，但对连通性的要求尚未被研究。

Result: 证明了加权版本的最小-最大连通多路割问题在树宽为二的图上是弱NP难的，并为树上的加权问题提供了伪多项式时间算法和FPTAS。同时，证明了（无约束的）最小-最大多路割问题即使对于三个终端也是NP难的。

Abstract: We introduce a variant of the multiway cut that we call the min-max connected multiway cut. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $Γ\subseteq V$ of $t$ terminals, partition $V$ into $t$ parts such that each part is connected and contains exactly one terminal; the objective is to minimize the maximum weight of the edges leaving any part of the partition. This problem is a natural modification of the standard multiway cut problem and it differs from it in two ways: first, the cost of a partition is defined to be the maximum size of the boundary of any part, as opposed to the sum of all boundaries, and second, the subgraph induced by each part is required to be connected. Although the modified objective function has been considered before in the literature under the name min-max multiway cut, the requirement on each component to be connected has not been studied as far as we know.
  We show various hardness results for this problem, including a proof of weak NP-hardness of the weighted version of the problem on graphs with tree-width two, and provide a pseudopolynomial time algorithm as well as an FPTAS for the weighted problem on trees. As a consequence of our investigation we also show that the (unconstrained) min-max multiway cut problem is NP-hard even for three terminals, strengthening the known results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更快的顶点多割算法，通过改进阴影移除步骤，将运行时间降至k^O(k)n^O(1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的顶点多割问题算法运行时间较长，作者旨在提供一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过改进顶点分离问题的阴影移除步骤，减少了时间开销。

Result: 新算法显著提升了运行效率，将时间从2^O(k^3)n^O(1)降低到k^O(k)n^O(1)。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种更快的算法来解决顶点多割问题，运行时间为k^O(k)n^O(1)。主要技术贡献是改进了顶点分离问题的阴影移除步骤，仅引入k^O(k)log n的时间开销。

Abstract: In the {\sc Vertex Multicut} problem the input consists of a graph $G$, integer $k$, and a set $\mathbf{T} = \{(s_1, t_1), \ldots, (s_p, t_p)\}$ of pairs of vertices of $G$. The task is to find a set $X$ of at most $k$ vertices such that, for every $(s_i, t_i) \in \mathbf{T}$, there is no path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ in $G - X$. Marx and Razgon [STOC 2011 and SICOMP 2014] and Bousquet, Daligault, and Thomassé [STOC 2011 and SICOMP 2018] independently and simultaneously gave the first algorithms for {\sc Vertex Multicut} with running time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$. The running time of their algorithms is $2^{O(k^3)}n^{O(1)}$ and $2^{O(k^{O(1)})}n^{O(1)}$, respectively. As part of their result, Marx and Razgon introduce the {\em shadow removal} technique, which was subsequently applied in algorithms for several parameterized cut and separation problems. The shadow removal step is the only step of the algorithm of Marx and Razgon which requires $2^{O(k^3)}n^{O(1)}$ time. Chitnis et al. [TALG 2015] gave an improved version of the shadow removal step, which, among other results, led to a $k^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for {\sc Vertex Multicut}.
  We give a faster algorithm for the {\sc Vertex Multicut} problem with running time $k^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$. Our main technical contribution is a refined shadow removal step for vertex separation problems that only introduces an overhead of $k^{O(k)}\log n$ time. The new shadow removal step implies a $k^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for {\sc Directed Subset Feedback Vertex Set} and a $k^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ time algorithm for {\sc Directed Multiway Cut}, improving over the previously best known algorithms of Chitnis et al. [TALG 2015].

Conclusion: 本文通过改进的精确计数和枚举方法，以及近似采样解决方案，显著提高了在不确定性边符号网络中三角形计数和枚举的效率。

Abstract: On signed social networks, balanced and unbalanced triangles are a critical motif due to their role as the foundations of Structural Balance Theory. The uses for these motifs have been extensively explored in networks with known edge signs, however in the real-world graphs with ground-truth signs are near non-existent, particularly on a large-scale. In reality, edge signs are inferred via various techniques with differing levels of confidence, meaning the edge signs on these graphs should be modelled with a probability value. In this work, we adapt balanced and unbalanced triangles to a setting with uncertain edge signs and explore the problems of triangle counting and enumeration. We provide a baseline and improved method (leveraging the inherent information provided by the edge probabilities in order to reduce the search space) for fast exact counting and enumeration. We also explore approximate solutions for counting via different sampling approaches, including leveraging insights from our improved exact solution to significantly reduce the runtime of each sample resulting in upwards of two magnitudes more queries executed per second. We evaluate the efficiency of all our solutions as well as examine the effectiveness of our sampling approaches on real-world topological networks with a variety of probability distributions.

Motivation: 解决现有树评估算法在空间和时间效率上的不足，尤其是在催化空间方面的优化。

Method: 通过结合匹配向量族和私有信息检索的技术，设计了一种新的催化算法。

Result: 提出了一种催化算法，实现了对数自由空间（O(log n)）、多项式运行时间和次多项式催化空间（2^log^ε n）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种改进的催化算法，用于树评估问题（TreeEval），在自由空间、运行时间和催化空间方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We give new algorithms for tree evaluation (S. Cook et al. TOCT 2012) in the catalytic-computing model (Buhrman et al. STOC 2014). Two existing approaches aim to solve tree evaluation (TreeEval) in low space: on the one hand, J. Cook and Mertz (STOC 2024) give an algorithm for TreeEval running in super-logarithmic space $O(\log n\log\log n)$ and super-polynomial time $n^{O(\log\log n)}$. On the other hand, a simple reduction from TreeEval to circuit evaluation, combined with the result of Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014), gives a catalytic algorithm for TreeEval running in logarithmic $O(\log n)$ free space and polynomial time, but with polynomial catalytic space.
  We show that the latter result can be improved. We give a catalytic algorithm for TreeEval with logarithmic $O(\log n)$ free space, polynomial runtime, and subpolynomial $2^{\log^εn}$ catalytic space (for any $ε> 0$). Our result gives the first natural problem known to be solvable with logarithmic free space and even $n^{1-ε}$ catalytic space, that is not known to be in standard logspace even under assumptions. Our result immediately implies an improved simulation of time by catalytic space, by the reduction of Williams (STOC 2025).
  Our catalytic TreeEval algorithm is inspired by a connection to matching vector families and private information retrieval, and improved constructions of (uniform) matching vector families would imply improvements to our algorithm.

Conclusion: 本文证明了在子线性时间中，非自适应查询模型无法实现强近似匹配大小，强调了适应性查询的必要性。同时，提出了一个简单的随机算法，在非自适应模型中实现了较弱的近似。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the size of the maximum matching in the sublinear-time setting. This problem has been extensively studied, with several known upper and lower bounds. A notable result by Behnezhad (FOCS 2021) established a 2-approximation in ~O(n) time.
  However, all known upper and lower bounds are in the adaptive query model, where each query can depend on previous answers. In contrast, non-adaptive query models-where the distribution over all queries must be fixed in advance-are widely studied in property testing, often revealing fundamental gaps between adaptive and non-adaptive complexities. This raises the natural question: is adaptivity also necessary for approximating the maximum matching size in sublinear time? This motivates the goal of achieving a constant or even a polylogarithmic approximation using ~O(n) non-adaptive adjacency list queries, similar to what was done by Behnezhad using adaptive queries.
  We show that this is not possible by proving that any randomized non-adaptive algorithm achieving an n^{1/3 - gamma}-approximation, for any constant gamma > 0, with probability at least 2/3, must make Omega(n^{1 + eps}) adjacency list queries, for some constant eps > 0 depending on gamma. This result highlights the necessity of adaptivity in achieving strong approximations. However, non-trivial upper bounds are still achievable: we present a simple randomized algorithm that achieves an n^{1/2}-approximation in O(n log^2 n) queries.
  Moreover, our lower bound also extends to the newly defined variant of the non-adaptive model, where queries are issued according to a fixed query tree, introduced by Azarmehr, Behnezhad, Ghafari, and Sudan (FOCS 2025) in the context of Local Computation Algorithms.

Method: 通过构建无限字符串家族，分析反转操作对BWT运行数、LZ解析大小等度量的影响，并给出渐近紧的上下界。

Result: 发现BWT运行数、LZ解析大小等度量在反转操作下可增加Θ(n)，且某些情况下比率趋近于3；最小词典解析大小的乘性敏感性为Θ(log n)。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了字符串反转对多种重复性度量的影响，包括BWT变体、LZ解析及其变体的敏感性，并指出了实际应用中广泛使用的重复性度量的局限性。

Abstract: We study the impact that string reversal can have on several repetitiveness measures. First, we exhibit an infinite family of strings where the number, $r$, of runs in the run-length encoding of the Burrows--Wheeler transform (BWT) can increase additively by $Θ(n)$ when reversing the string. This substantially improves the known $Ω(\log n)$ lower-bound for the additive sensitivity of $r$ and it is asymptotically tight. We generalize our result to other variants of the BWT, including the variant with an appended end-of-string symbol and the bijective BWT. We show that an analogous result holds for the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv 77 (LZ) parsing of the text, and also for some of its variants, including the non-overlapping LZ parsing, and the LZ-end parsing. Moreover, we describe a family of strings for which the ratio $z(w^R)/z(w)$ approaches $3$ from below as $|w|\rightarrow \infty$. We also show an asymptotically tight lower-bound of $Θ(n)$ for the additive sensitivity of the size $v$ of the smallest lexicographic parsing to string reversal. Finally, we show that the multiplicative sensitivity of $v$ to reversing the string is $Θ(\log n)$, and this lower-bound is also tight. Overall, our results expose the limitations of repetitiveness measures that are widely used in practice, against string reversal -- a simple and natural data transformation.

Abstract: Pseudo-deterministic algorithms are randomized algorithms that, with high constant probability, output a fixed canonical solution. The study of pseudo-deterministic algorithms for the global minimum cut problem was recently initiated by Agarwala and Varma [ITCS'26], who gave a black-box reduction incurring an $O(\log n \log \log n)$ overhead. We introduce a natural graph-theoretic tie-breaking mechanism that uniquely selects a canonical minimum cut. Using this mechanism, we obtain: (i) A pseudo-deterministic minimum cut algorithm for weighted graphs running in $O(m\log^2 n)$ time, eliminating the $O(\log n \log \log n)$ overhead of prior work and matching existing randomized algorithms. (ii) The first pseudo-deterministic algorithm for maintaining a canonical minimum cut in a fully-dynamic unweighted graph, with $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ update time and $\tilde{O}(n)$ query time. (iii) Improved pseudo-deterministic algorithms for unweighted graphs in the dynamic streaming and cut-query models of computation, matching the best randomized algorithms.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种随机算法，显著提高了计算Welzl顺序的效率，并在图类和模型检查中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Orders with low crossing number, introduced by Welzl, are a fundamental tool in range searching and computational geometry. Recently, they have found important applications in structural graph theory: set systems with linear shatter functions correspond to graph classes with linear neighborhood complexity. For such systems, Welzl's theorem guarantees the existence of orders with only $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$ crossings. A series of works has progressively improved the runtime for computing such orders, from Chazelle and Welzl's original $\mathcal{O}(|U|^3 |\mathcal{F}|)$ bound, through Har-Peled's $\mathcal{O}(|U|^2|\mathcal{F}|)$, to the recent sampling-based methods of Csikós and Mustafa.
  We present a randomized algorithm that computes Welzl orders for set systems with linear primal and dual shatter functions in time $\mathcal{O}(\|S\| \log \|S\|)$, where $\|S\| = |U| + \sum_{X \in \mathcal{F}} |X|$ is the size of the canonical input representation. As an application, we compute compact neighborhood covers in graph classes with (near-)linear neighborhood complexity in time \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) and improve the runtime of first-order model checking on monadically stable graph classes from $\mathcal{O}(n^{5+\varepsilon})$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^{3+\varepsilon})$.

Abstract: Given an undirected graph G and a set A \subseteq V(G), an A-path is a path in G that starts and ends at two distinct vertices of A with intermediate vertices in V(G) \setminus A. An A-path is called an (A,\ell)-path if the length of the path is exactly \ell. In the {\sc (A, \ell)-Path Packing} problem (ALPP), we seek to determine whether there exist k vertex-disjoint (A, \ell)-paths in G or not. We pursue this problem with respect to structural parameters. We prove that ALPP is W[1]-hard when it is parameterized by the combined parameter distance to path (dtp) and |A|. In addition, we consider the combined parameters distance to cluster (cvd) + |A| and distance to cluster (cvd) + \ell. For both these combined parameters, we provide FPT algorithms. Finally, we consider the vertex cover number (vc) as the parameter and provide a kernel with O(vc^2) vertices.

Abstract: We present the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing a near-optimal \emph{flow}-expander decomposition. Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $φ$, our algorithm removes at most a $φ\log^{1+o(1)}n$ fraction of edges so that every remaining connected component is a $φ$-\emph{flow}-expander (a stronger guarantee than being a $φ$-\emph{cut}-expander). This achieves overhead $\log^{1+o(1)}n$, nearly matching the $Ω(\log n)$ graph-theoretic lower bound that already holds for cut-expander decompositions, up to a $\log^{o(1)}n$ factor. Prior polynomial-time algorithms required removing $O(φ\log^{1.5}n)$ and $O(φ\log^{2}n)$ fractions of edges to guarantee $φ$-cut-expander and $φ$-flow-expander components, respectively.
