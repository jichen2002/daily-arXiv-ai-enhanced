### [1] [Spanning the Visual Analogy Space with a Weight Basis of LoRAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15727)
*Hila Manor,Rinon Gal,Haggai Maron,Tomer Michaeli,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRWeB通过动态组合LoRA模块，提升了视觉类比任务的泛化能力，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用单一LoRA模块难以捕捉多样化的视觉转换空间，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出LoRWeB方法，包含可学习的LoRA模块基础和轻量级编码器，动态选择和加权这些基础LoRA模块。

Result: 综合评估表明，LoRWeB在未见过的视觉转换上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LoRWeB通过动态组合学习到的转换原语，显著提升了视觉类比任务的泛化能力，为灵活的视觉操作提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\{\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{a}'$, $\mathbf{b}\}$, the goal is to generate $\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\mathbf{a} : \mathbf{a}' :: \mathbf{b} : \mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a "space of LoRAs". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAFNet是一种受生物启发的息肉分割网络，通过模仿人类视觉系统，显著提升分割精度和泛化能力，代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结肠镜中准确的息肉分割对癌症预防至关重要，但现有深度学习方法因单向处理、弱多尺度融合和缺乏解剖约束，常导致误分割或漏检。

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的解耦框架在零样本人类-物体交互检测中表现出色，具有强大的跨数据集泛化能力，并能灵活集成任何物体检测器而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.

Abstract: The study of histopathological subtypes is valuable for the personalisation of effective treatment strategies for ovarian cancer. However, increasing diagnostic workloads present a challenge for UK pathology departments, leading to the rise in AI approaches. While traditional approaches in this field have relied on pre-computed, frozen image features, recent advances have shifted towards end-to-end feature extraction, providing an improvement in accuracy but at the expense of significantly reduced scalability during training and time-consuming experimentation. In this paper, we propose a new approach for subtype classification and localisation in ovarian cancer histopathology images using contrastive and prototype learning with pre-computed, frozen features via feature-space augmentations. Compared to DSMIL, our method achieves an improvement of 70.4\% and 15.3\% in F1 score for instance- and slide-level classification, respectively, along with AUC gains of 16.9\% for instance localisation and 2.3\% for slide classification, while maintaining the use of frozen patch features.

### [5] [Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154)
*Praditha Alwis,Soumyadeep Chandra,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于累积样本损失（CSL）的标注错误检测方法，无需真实标注错误数据，适用于多种视频数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量视频数据集对训练稳健模型至关重要，但现有数据集常存在标注错误（如错误标记和时序错乱），影响模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的、模型无关的标注错误检测方法，通过分析累积样本损失（CSL）来识别标注错误。

Result: 在EgoPER和Cholec80数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测错误标记和时序错乱等标注错误。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频数据集审核和提升机器学习训练可靠性提供了有力工具。

Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.

Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种通过揭示偏好来研究视觉语言模型（VLMs）视觉偏好的框架，并展示了优化视觉提示如何显著改变选择概率。这种方法为图像AI代理的审计和治理提供了实用且高效的途径。

Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低样本情况下，提高跨视频多样性同时保持时间一致性是一个挑战，现有方法往往牺牲后者或计算成本高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样性上与强基线相当，同时显著提高了时间一致性和色彩自然度。

Conclusion: 提出的联合采样框架在保持时间一致性的同时提高了批量多样性，且避免了高成本的视频解码和反向传播。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.

Motivation: 观察到Vid-LLMs中存在视觉语义内化现象，导致原始视觉输入在深层推理中结构冗余，需要解决性能退化问题。

Method: 提出Sparrow框架，利用视觉感知的文本锚定窗口注意力隐藏状态重用，将视觉计算完全卸载到目标模型，并通过中间层视觉状态桥接训练草案模型。

Result: 实验显示Sparrow在25k视觉令牌下平均加速2.82倍，有效解决长序列性能退化。

Conclusion: Sparrow框架通过视觉感知的文本锚定窗口注意力和中间层视觉状态桥接，有效解决了Vid-LLMs中的性能退化问题，实现了长序列下的高效推理。

Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.

Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

Conclusion: GMAIL框架通过将生成图像视为独立模态，并在潜在空间中进行多模态学习，有效提升了生成图像在视觉语言任务中的学习效果。该方法易于与多种视觉语言模型结合，并在多项任务中表现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架通过检测和抑制目标类特征的幻觉，显著提升了昼夜图像翻译的质量和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

Conclusion: ASBM通过两阶段方法在生成建模中恢复了高维数据的最优轨迹，显著提高了采样路径的直线性和效率，并在图像生成实验中展示了更高的保真度和更少的采样步骤。

Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

Result: LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B在零样本条件下表现最优，EER比任务专用MAD基线至少低23%。

Conclusion: 开源多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）在生物识别安全和法医图像分析中展现出可重复、可解释且具竞争力的潜力，为零样本MAD系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: RPT-SR通过将场景布局信息显式编码到注意力机制中，显著提升了红外图像超分辨率的效果，并在多个数据集上实现了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

Method: LEADER采用轻量级端到端注意力门控双自动编码器结构，整合非极大值抑制和角度解码，仅需0.9M参数。

Conclusion: LEADER在指纹识别中实现了端到端的特征提取，显著提升了准确性和计算效率，并在公开源代码和预训练权重上促进了可复现性。

Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

Conclusion: 语义过滤框架通过利用视觉语言模型进行类别感知的瞬态对象移除，有效解决了3D高斯溅射重建中的鬼影问题，同时保持了低内存开销和实时渲染性能。

Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的动态无训练融合框架在多样化的主题-风格组合实验中，始终在质量和数量上优于现有的LoRA融合方法，实现了无需重新训练即可动态合成连贯的主题与风格。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.

Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

Conclusion: CEMRAG框架通过将视觉表示分解为可解释的临床概念，并结合多模态RAG，提高了放射学报告生成的解释性和事实准确性，挑战了解释性与性能之间的传统权衡。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

Method: 使用YOLOv8、YOLOv9和YOLO11模型在草莓成熟度数据集上进行比较测试。

Result: YOLOv9c模型精度最高（90.94%），YOLO11s模型召回率最高（83.74%），YOLOv8s模型在mAP@50指标上表现最佳（86.09%）。

Conclusion: 小型和中型模型在此类数据集上表现更为平衡和高效，同时为智能农业应用建立了基础参考点。

Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces RaCo, a lightweight neural network designed to learn robust and versatile keypoints suitable for a variety of 3D computer vision tasks. The model integrates three key components: the repeatable keypoint detector, a differentiable ranker to maximize matches with a limited number of keypoints, and a covariance estimator to quantify spatial uncertainty in metric scale. Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations. Ultimately, RaCo provides an effective and simple strategy to independently estimate keypoint ranking and metric covariance without additional labels, detecting interpretable and repeatable interest points.

Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于标准优先、语义后置的新范式，强调在图像科学中实现可重复分析和跨领域可比性的重要性。

Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.

Method: 提出ToaSt框架，对ViT的不同组件采用专门策略：对多头自注意力模块应用耦合头结构化剪枝，对前馈网络引入令牌通道选择（TCS）。

Result: 在九种不同模型上的评估显示，ToaSt在准确性和效率之间实现了优越的权衡，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: ToaSt框架在ViT-MAE-Huge上实现了88.52%的准确率（+1.64%）和39.4%的FLOPs减少，并在下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 在R2R基准测试中，实验结果显示在成功率和导航效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 检索增强的决策支持是提升基于LLM的视觉与语言导航的有效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一的稀疏体素表示框架，结合语言和几何基础，实现了3D场景中外观、语义和几何的协同建模，显著提升了整体场景理解和重建的性能。

Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.

Conclusion: CARL-XRay提供了一种实用的持续临床部署替代方案，避免了联合训练和重复的完全重新训练。

Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

Result: 尽管人类绘制的草图数据极少，该方法仍能生成高质量的时序草图，严格遵循文本指定的顺序，并展现丰富的视觉细节。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合大型语言模型和视频扩散模型的优势，实现了高质量的时序草图生成，并展示了其在风格控制和交互式绘图中的灵活性。

Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

### [44] [CircuChain: Disentangling Competence and Compliance in LLM Circuit Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15037)
*Mayank Ravishankara*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CircuChain 基准测试显示，模型能力提升不一定改善指令遵循，最强模型物理推理优秀但易违反约定，较弱模型则相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨前沿模型在电路分析中是否真正应用基本原理推理，还是依赖与明确指令冲突的训练先验。

Method: CircuChain 是一个诊断基准，包含五种典型电路拓扑的平衡控制/陷阱问题对，并通过符号求解器、SPICE 模拟和基于 LLM 的错误分类法进行多阶段验证。

Result: 最强模型表现出近乎完美的物理推理能力，但在陷阱条件下违反约定的比例较高；较弱模型物理保真度较低但指令遵循更优。

Conclusion: CircuChain 揭示了模型能力提升不一定保证约束对齐的改善，强调了在数学严格领域中需要新的评估框架来强调指令遵循。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance toward expert-level performance in engineering domains, reliable reasoning under user-specified constraints becomes critical. In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains. CircuChain provides one such framework and offers actionable insights for both engineering education and AI alignment research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI文档实践（如Model Cards、Datasheets）多为回顾性且缺乏机器可读性，无法满足代理型AI系统前瞻性设计的需求。

Method: AAC 框架通过六个维度（定义与范围、用户期望、开发者可行性评估、治理阶段、数据访问与敏感性、结果）结构化设计代理系统，并采用语义网兼容的元数据模式实现。

Result: AAC 实现为隐私保护的客户端Web应用，支持实时验证，并导出符合FAIR标准的RO-Crates，适用于研究、临床和机构场景。

Conclusion: Agentic Automation Canvas (AAC) 提供了一个前瞻性的框架，用于设计、治理和评估代理型AI系统，并通过开源工具实现机器可读性和互操作性。

Abstract: Agentic AI prototypes are being deployed across domains with increasing speed, yet no methodology for their structured design, governance, and prospective evaluation has been established. Existing AI documentation practices and guidelines - Model Cards, Datasheets, or NIST AI RMF - are either retrospective or lack machine-readability and interoperability. We present the Agentic Automation Canvas (AAC), a structured framework for the prospective design of agentic systems and a tool to facilitate communication between their users and developers. The AAC captures six dimensions of an automation project: definition and scope; user expectations with quantified benefit metrics; developer feasibility assessments; governance staging; data access and sensitivity; and outcomes. The framework is implemented as a semantic web-compatible metadata schema with controlled vocabulary and mappings to established ontologies such as Schema.org and W3C DCAT. It is made accessible through a privacy-preserving, fully client-side web application with real-time validation. Completed canvases export as FAIR-compliant RO-Crates, yielding versioned, shareable, and machine-interoperable project contracts between users and developers. We describe the schema design, benefit quantification model, and prospective application to diverse use cases from research, clinical, and institutional settings. The AAC and its web application are available as open-source code and interactive web form at https://aac.slolab.ai

Motivation: 探讨系统提示对通用指令调优语言模型（ILMs）和专用代码语言模型（CLMs）在代码生成中的影响。

Method: 系统评估了360种配置，涵盖四种模型、五种系统提示、三种提示策略、两种编程语言和两种温度设置。

Result: 发现系统提示的约束特异性不总是提升正确性；few-shot示例可能降低大型代码专用模型的性能；Java对系统提示的敏感性显著高于Python。

Conclusion: 系统提示的设计对代码生成模型的性能有显著影响，但其效果取决于配置的匹配度。对于大型代码专用模型，few-shot示例可能不如zero-shot生成有效。此外，不同编程语言对系统提示的敏感性不同，需针对性设计提示策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Language Models (ILMs) have become essential components of modern AI systems, demonstrating exceptional versatility across natural language and reasoning tasks. Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs -- commonly referred to as Code Language Models (CLMs) -- translate human intent into executable programs. While progress has been driven by advances in scaling and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored: the impact of system prompts on both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs for code generation. We systematically evaluate how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect code assistant. Our experimental setting spans 360 configurations across four models, five system prompts, three prompting strategies, two languages, and two temperature settings. We find that (1) increasing system-prompt constraint specificity does not monotonically improve correctness -- prompt effectiveness is configuration-dependent and can help or hinder based on alignment with task requirements and decoding context; (2) for larger code-specialized models, few-shot examples can degrade performance relative to zero-shot generation, contrary to conventional wisdom; and (3) programming language matters, with Java exhibiting significantly greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python, suggesting language-specific prompt engineering strategies may be necessary.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping how computing systems are designed, optimized, and built, yet research remains fragmented across software, architecture, and chip design communities. This paper takes a cross-stack perspective, examining how generative models are being applied from code generation and distributed runtimes through hardware design space exploration to RTL synthesis, physical layout, and verification. Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one. Our analysis covers more than 275 papers spanning eleven application areas across three layers of the computing stack, and distills open research questions that become visible only from a cross-layer vantage point.

Abstract: Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy. Each code smell category includes over 10,000 labeled samples. This dataset could provide a large-scale and publicly available benchmark to facilitate future studies on code smell detection and automated refactoring.

Conclusion: 该系统通过整合多源错误数据和利用大语言模型生成自然语言解释，显著降低了平均解决时间并改善了用户体验。

Abstract: Modern web dashboards and enterprise applications increasingly rely on complex, distributed microservices architectures. While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations. This approach significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution for support engineers and improves the user experience by transforming cryptic error codes into actionable insights.

Abstract: Software repositories provide a detailed record of software evolution by capturing developer interactions through code-related activities such as pull requests and modifications. To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions. The results highlight the utility of our framework in improving open-source project maintenance through data-driven analysis of collaboration dynamics.

Motivation: 数学形态学在图像处理中广泛应用，但传统方法缺乏全局拓扑特征的捕捉。结合数学形态学和持久同调可以同时提取局部几何和全局拓扑信息。

Method: 利用不同形状的结构元素构建拓扑过滤，通过GUDHI包进行持久同调计算。

Result: 提出的基于数学形态学的持久同调框架能够编码数字图像的空间和形态特征，提供比传统立方同调更丰富的局部几何信息。

Conclusion: MMPersistence库通过整合数学形态学操作和持久同调计算，为数字图像分析提供了一个统一的基础，结合了拓扑洞察和形态学图像处理技术。

Abstract: Mathematical morphology (MM) is a powerful and widely used framework in image processing. Through set-theoretic and discrete geometric principles, MM operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing effectively manipulate digital images by modifying local structures via structuring elements (SEs), while cubical homology captures global topological features such as connected components and loop structures within images. Building on the GUDHI package for persistent homology (PH) computation on cubical complexes, we propose the MMPersistence library, which integrates MM operations with diverse SEs and PH computation to extract multiscale persistence information. By employing SEs of different shapes to construct topological filtrations, the proposed MM-based PH framework encodes both spatial and morphological characteristics of digital images, providing richer local geometric information than conventional cubical homology alone and establishing a unified foundation for analyzing digital images that integrates topological insight with morphological image processing techniques.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of regularization of latent spaces through truncation on the quality of generated test inputs for deep learning classifiers. We evaluate this effect using style-based GANs, a state-of-the-art generative approach, and assess quality along three dimensions: validity, diversity, and fault detection. We evaluate our approach on the boundary testing of deep learning image classifiers across three datasets, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10. We compare two truncation strategies: latent code mixing with binary search optimization and random latent truncation for generative exploration. Our experiments show that the latent code-mixing approach yields a higher fault detection rate than random truncation, while also improving both diversity and validity.

Abstract: Testing functionality in Software-Defined Vehicles is challenging because requirements are written in natural language, specifications combine text, tables, and diagrams, while test assets are scattered across heterogeneous toolchains. Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models are used to extract signals and behavioral logic to automatically generate Gherkin scenarios, which are then converted into runnable test scripts. The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration standardizes signal references, supporting portability across subsystems and test benches. The pipeline uses retrieval-augmented generation to preselect candidate VSS signals before mapping. We evaluate the approach on the safety-relevant Child Presence Detection System, executing the generated tests in a virtual environment and on an actual vehicle. Our evaluation covers Gherkin validity, VSS mapping quality, and end-to-end executability. Results show that 32 of 36 requirements (89\%) can be transformed into executable scenarios in our setting, while human review and targeted substitutions remain necessary. This paper is a feasibility and architectural demonstration of an end-to-end requirements-to-test pipeline for SDV subsystems, evaluated on a CPDS case in simulation and Vehicle-in-the-Loop settings.

Motivation: 评估和确保LLM生成的代码重构与原始实现之间的功能等效性至关重要，而现有方法依赖预定义测试用例，存在局限性。

Method: 利用差分模糊测试（differential fuzzing）来检查LLM生成代码重构的功能等效性，无需预定义测试用例。

Result: 在六种LLM（CodeLlama、Codestral等）的大规模评估中，发现19-35%的重构存在功能非等效性，且21%未被现有测试套件检测到。

Conclusion: 研究发现，依赖现有测试可能会高估LLM生成的代码重构的功能等效性，因为存在语义偏差的风险。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in automated code refactoring, assessing and ensuring functional equivalence between LLM-generated refactoring and the original implementation becomes critical. While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Breslauer-Italiano在线后缀树构建算法的改进方法，实现了多个字符串经典问题的近实时在线算法，显著提升了最坏情况下每个字母的更新时间复杂度至多对数对数级别，并在线性空间内完成。

Abstract: Based on the Breslauer-Italiano online suffix tree construction algorithm (2013) with double logarithmic worst-case guarantees on the update time per letter, we develop near-real-time algorithms for several classical problems on strings, including the computation of the longest repeating suffix array, the (reversed) Lempel-Ziv 77 factorization, and the maintenance of minimal unique substrings, all in an online manner. Our solutions improve over the best known running times for these problems in terms of the worst-case time per letter, for which we achieve a poly-log-logarithmic time complexity, within a linear space. Best known results for these problems require a poly-logarithmic time complexity per letter or only provide amortized complexity bounds. As a result of independent interest, we give conversions between the longest previous factor array and the longest repeating suffix array in space and time bounds based on their irreducible representations, which can have sizes sublinear in the length of the input string.

Abstract: The sparse matrix compression problem asks for a one-dimensional representation of a binary $n \times \ell$ matrix, formed by an integer array of row indices and a shift function for each row, such that accessing a matrix entry is possible in constant time by consulting this representation. It has been shown that the decision problem for finding an integer array of length $\ell+ρ$ or restricting the shift function up to values of $ρ$ is NP-complete (cf. the textbook of Garey and Johnson). As a practical heuristic, a greedy algorithm has been proposed to shift the $i$-th row until it forms a solution with its predecessor rows. Despite that this greedy algorithm is cherished for its good approximation in practice, we show that it actually exhibits an approximation ratio of $Θ(\sqrt{\ell+ρ})$. We give further hardness results for parameterizations such as the number of distinct rows or the maximum number of non-zero entries per row. Finally, we devise a DP-algorithm that solves the problem for double-logarithmic matrix widths or logarithmic widths for further restrictions. We study all these findings also under a new perspective by introducing a variant of the problem, where we wish to minimize the length of the resulting integer array by trimming the non-zero borders, which has not been studied in the literature before but has practical motivations.

Result: 证明了非自适应双侧测试器的Ω(n^(1/2-δ)/√ε)下界，以及自适应单侧测试器的Ω(√n)下界；提出了查询复杂度为O(√(mℓ)/(εn))和O(m^(1/3)/ε^(2/3))的算法。

Conclusion: 论文提出了关于有向无环图（DAGs）上实值函数单调性测试的新下界和算法改进，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: We study monotonicity testing of real-valued functions on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with $n$ vertices. For every constant $δ>0$, we prove a $Ω(n^{1/2-δ}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ lower bound against non-adaptive two-sided testers on DAGs, nearly matching the classical $O(\sqrt{n/\varepsilon})$-query upper bound. For constant $\varepsilon$, we also prove an $Ω(\sqrt n)$ lower bound for randomized adaptive one-sided testers on explicit bipartite DAGs, whereas previously only an $Ω(\log n)$ lower bound was known. A key technical ingredient in both lower bounds is positive-matching Ruzsa--Szemerédi families. On the algorithmic side, we give simple non-adaptive one-sided testers with query complexity $O(\sqrt{m\,\ell}/(\varepsilon n))$ and $O(m^{1/3}/\varepsilon^{2/3})$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the transitive reduction and $\ell$ is the number of edges in the transitive closure. For constant $\varepsilon>0$, these improve over the previous $O(\sqrt{n/\varepsilon})$ bound when $m\ell=o(n^3)$ and $m=o(n^{3/2})$, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种内存分配器，其最坏情况预期开销为polylog(ε⁻¹)，优于先前结果，并证明了在某些情况下昂贵重建的不可避免性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态内存分配问题，即在内存中动态维护不同大小对象的非重叠连续分配，同时支持在线更新（插入/删除），并最小化重排开销。

Method: 论文通过应用向日葵引理（sunflower lemma）来改进内存分配算法，该方法在子集和问题中曾被Erdős和Sárközy使用。

Result: 提出的分配器在最坏情况下预期开销为polylog(ε⁻¹)，显著优于先前的结果，并证明了在某些情况下必须进行昂贵重建的必要性。

Conclusion: 该论文的主要结论是提出了一种内存分配器，其最坏情况下的预期开销为polylog(ε⁻¹)，显著优于先前的工作，并接近理论下限。同时，论文证明了在某些情况下必须进行昂贵的重建，这是不可避免的。

Abstract: The Memory Reallocation problem asks to dynamically maintain an assignment of given objects of various sizes to non-overlapping contiguous chunks of memory, while supporting updates (insertions/deletions) in an online fashion. The total size of live objects at any time is guaranteed to be at most a $1-ε$ fraction of the total memory. To handle an online update, the allocator may rearrange the objects in memory to make space, and the overhead for this update is defined as the total size of moved objects divided by the size of the object being inserted/deleted.
  Our main result is an allocator with worst-case expected overhead $\mathrm{polylog}(ε^{-1})$. This exponentially improves the previous worst-case expected overhead $\tilde O(ε^{-1/2})$ achieved by Farach-Colton, Kuszmaul, Sheffield, and Westover (2024), narrowing the gap towards the $Ω(\logε^{-1})$ lower bound. Our improvement is based on an application of the sunflower lemma previously used by Erdős and Sárközy (1992) in the context of subset sums.
  Our allocator achieves polylogarithmic overhead only in expectation, and sometimes performs expensive rebuilds. Our second technical result shows that this is necessary: it is impossible to achieve subpolynomial overhead with high probability.

Result: 证明了公平相关聚类问题在多种结构图参数下是可处理的，结果位于已知NP难问题边界的可处理性边缘。

Conclusion: 该论文通过参数化复杂度分析，证明了在多种结构图参数（如树宽、树深和顶点覆盖数）下，公平相关聚类问题是可处理的，尽管已知其在严格受限输入下是NP难问题。

Abstract: We study the generalization of Correlation Clustering which incorporates fairness constraints via the notion of fairlets. The corresponding Fair Correlation Clustering problem has been studied from several perspectives to date, but has so far lacked a detailed analysis from the parameterized complexity paradigm. We close this gap by providing tractability results for the problem under a variety of structural graph parameterizations, including treewidth, treedepth and the vertex cover number; our results lie at the very edge of tractability given the known NP-hardness of the problem on severely restricted inputs.

### [60] [A Weighted-to-Unweighted Reduction for Matroid Intersection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15702)
*Aditi Dudeja,Mara Grilnberger*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: A reduction framework converts unweighted matroid intersection algorithms into weighted ones with minimal approximation loss and logarithmic runtime increase, applicable in streaming and communication complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observed gap between the best known results for unweighted and weighted matroid intersection problems across various settings. The goal is to develop a general approach to close this gap efficiently.

Method: The authors introduce a reduction technique that bridges the gap between unweighted and weighted matroid intersection algorithms. The method involves increasing the runtime by a log W factor, where W is the aspect ratio, to achieve an α(1−ε)-approximation for the weighted version.

Result: The main result is a reduction framework that successfully converts unweighted approximation algorithms into weighted ones with a slight loss in approximation ratio (α(1−ε)) and a logarithmic increase in runtime (log W). This framework also yields new results in streaming and one-way communication complexity models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a reduction framework that converts any α-approximate unweighted matroid intersection algorithm into an α(1−ε)-approximate weighted matroid intersection algorithm, with a runtime increase of a log W factor. This framework is versatile and applicable to settings like streaming and one-way communication complexity, leading to new results in these models.

Abstract: Given two matroids $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ over the same ground set, the matroid intersection problem is to find the maximum cardinality common independent set. In the weighted version of the problem, the goal is to find a maximum weight common independent set. It has been a matter of interest to find efficient approximation algorithms for this problem in various settings. In many of these models, there is a gap between the best known results for the unweighted and weighted versions. In this work, we address the question of closing this gap. Our main result is a reduction which converts any $α$-approximate unweighted matroid intersection algorithm into an $α(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate weighted matroid intersection algorithm, while increasing the runtime of the algorithm by a $\log W$ factor, where $W$ is the aspect ratio. Our framework is versatile and translates to settings such as streaming and one-way communication complexity where matroid intersection is well-studied. As a by-product of our techniques, we derive new results for weighted matroid intersection in these models.

Motivation: 研究图数据在本地隐私模型中的节点差分隐私问题，解决传统方法不适用于图数据重叠输入的问题。

Method: 开发了一个新颖的算法框架，用于在本地模型中准确回答输入图度分布的线性查询，并证明了错误下界。

Result: 提出的算法在某些自然问题上与中心模型中的节点隐私准确性相匹配，并证明了LNDP设置下的最优性。

Conclusion: 本文证明了局部节点隐私与标准表格数据本地模型之间存在定性差异，并展示了在交互式LNDP设置下算法的优越性。

Abstract: We initiate an investigation of node differential privacy for graphs in the local model of private data analysis. In our model, dubbed LNDP, each node sees its own edge list and releases the output of a local randomizer on this input. These outputs are aggregated by an untrusted server to obtain a final output.
  We develop a novel algorithmic framework for this setting that allows us to accurately answer arbitrary linear queries on a blurry approximation of the input graph's degree distribution. For some natural problems, the resulting algorithms match the accuracy achievable with node privacy in the central model, where data are held and processed by a trusted server. We also prove lower bounds on the error required by LNDP that imply the optimality of our algorithms for several fundamental graph statistics. We then lift these lower bounds to the interactive LNDP setting, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithms even when constantly many rounds of interaction are permitted. Obtaining our lower bounds requires new approaches, since those developed for the usual local model do not apply to the inherently overlapping inputs that arise from graphs. Finally, we prove structural results that reveal qualitative differences between local node privacy and the standard local model for tabular data.

Conclusion: CLOT系统通过高频定位反馈实现了无漂移的长时间人形机器人远程操作，验证了高动态运动、高精度跟踪和强大的仿真到现实的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-horizon whole-body humanoid teleoperation remains challenging due to accumulated global pose drift, particularly on full-sized humanoids. Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation. Motion data, demos and code can be found in our website.

Result: 评估显示当前基础模型存在显著安全缺陷，验证了架构安全机制的必要性。

Conclusion: Safe-SDL框架为自主科学系统的安全部署提供了理论基础和实践指导，为AI驱动发现的负责任加速奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of Self-Driving Laboratories (SDLs) transforms scientific discovery methodology by integrating AI with robotic automation to create closed-loop experimental systems capable of autonomous hypothesis generation, experimentation, and analysis. While promising to compress research timelines from years to weeks, their deployment introduces unprecedented safety challenges differing from traditional laboratories or purely digital AI. This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles. Evaluation against the LabSafety Bench reveals that current foundation models exhibit significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential rather than optional. Our framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for safe deployment of autonomous scientific systems, establishing the groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven discovery.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在技术潜力上被广泛讨论，但缺乏对其人本影响（如人本理解、用户建模和自主水平）的系统性研究，难以整合LLM驱动的HRI系统中的新兴挑战。

Method: 作者遵循PRISMA指南进行了系统性文献搜索，筛选出86篇符合标准的文章。

Result: 研究发现：(1) LLMs通过重塑机器人感知环境、生成社交化交互及在具身环境中持续与人类需求对齐的方式，正在改变HRI的基础；(2) 当前研究多为探索性，不同研究关注LLM驱动HRI的不同方面，导致实验设计、研究方法和评估指标差异较大。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LLM在HRI中的关键设计考虑和挑战，为未来研究提供了连贯的概述和指南。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are profoundly reshaping the field of human-robot interaction (HRI). While prior work has highlighted the technical potential of LLMs, few studies have systematically examined their human-centered impact (e.g., human-oriented understanding, user modeling, and levels of autonomy), making it difficult to consolidate emerging challenges in LLM-driven HRI systems. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search following the PRISMA guideline, identifying 86 articles that met our inclusion criteria. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs are transforming the fundamentals of HRI by reshaping how robots sense context, generate socially grounded interactions, and maintain continuous alignment with human needs in embodied settings; and (2) current research is largely exploratory, with different studies focusing on different facets of LLM-driven HRI, resulting in wide-ranging choices of experimental setups, study methods, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify key design considerations and challenges, offering a coherent overview and guidelines for future research at the intersection of LLMs and HRI.

Abstract: Mobile robots operating in agroindustrial environments, such as Mediterranean greenhouses, are subject to challenging conditions, including uneven terrain, variable friction, payload changes, and terrain slopes, all of which significantly affect control performance and stability. Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.

Motivation: 数据驱动的抓取预测依赖于大规模多样化的数据集，但这些数据集生成成本高且通常局限于有限的夹爪形态。分析抓取合成虽可扩展数据收集，但简化假设常导致物理不可行的抓取，需通过高保真模拟器过滤，从而减少抓取数量和多样性。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping is fundamental to robotics, yet data-driven grasp prediction heavily relies on large, diverse datasets that are costly to generate and typically limited to a narrow set of gripper morphologies. Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.
  We propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment. Experiments on a newly introduced Handles dataset and a DexGraspNet subset demonstrate that our approach achieves over 120 distinct stable grasps per object (a 1.7-6x improvement over unrefined analytical methods) while outperforming diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60\% in unique grasp coverage.

Abstract: Remote Operation is touted as being key to the rapid deployment of automated vehicles. Streaming imagery to control connected vehicles remotely currently requires a reliable, high throughput network connection, which can be limited in real-world remote operation deployments relying on public network infrastructure. This paper investigates how the application of computer vision assisted semantic communication can be used to circumvent data loss and corruption associated with traditional image compression techniques. By encoding the segmentations of detected road users into colour coded highlights within low resolution greyscale imagery, the required data rate can be reduced by 50 \% compared with conventional techniques, while maintaining visual clarity. This enables a median glass-to-glass latency of below 200ms even when the network data rate is below 500kbit/s, while clearly outlining salient road users to enhance situational awareness of the remote operator. The approach is demonstrated in an area of variable 4G mobile connectivity using an automated last-mile delivery vehicle. With this technique, the results indicate that large-scale deployment of remotely operated automated vehicles could be possible even on the often constrained public 4G/5G mobile network, providing the potential to expedite the nationwide roll-out of automated vehicles.

Abstract: Self-propelling robotic capsules eliminate shaft looping of conventional colonoscopy, reducing patient discomfort. However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.

Abstract: Imitation learning frameworks that learn robot control policies from demonstrators' motions via hand-mounted demonstration interfaces have attracted increasing attention. However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback.

Abstract: Magnetic actuation enables surgical robots to navigate complex anatomical pathways while reducing tissue trauma and improving surgical precision. However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries.

Conclusion: 本文通过建立从VLA优化角度出发的设计原则，提出了ActionCodec这一高性能动作分词器，显著提升了训练效率和VLA性能，并为社区开发更有效的动作分词器提供了清晰路线图。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.

Abstract: A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的非参数记忆框架在具身探索和问答任务中表现出色，显著提升了探索效率和复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.

Abstract: Efficiently training control policies for robots is a major challenge that can greatly benefit from utilizing knowledge gained from training similar systems through cross-embodiment knowledge transfer. In this work, we focus on accelerating policy training using a library-based initialization scheme that enables effective knowledge transfer across multirotor configurations. By leveraging a physics-aware neural control architecture that combines a reinforcement learning-based controller and a supervised control allocation network, we enable the reuse of previously trained policies. To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm that our control architecture achieves state-of-the-art control performance, and that our initialization scheme saves on average up to $73.5\%$ of environment interactions (compared to training a policy from scratch) across diverse quadrotor and hexarotor designs, paving the way for efficient cross-embodiment transfer in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.

Conclusion: VLM-DEWM被证明是一种可验证且具有弹性的解决方案，适用于动态制造环境中的长时程机器人操作。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) shows promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing, yet their deployment in dynamic workcells faces two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation, they cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift; and (2) opaque reasoning, failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries. This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.

Abstract: Friction is the essential mediator of terrestrial locomotion, yet in robotic systems it is almost always treated as a passive property fixed by surface materials and conditions. Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between "grip" and "slip" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.

Abstract: Autonomous landing of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on oscillating marine platforms is severely constrained by wave-induced multi-frequency oscillations, wind disturbances, and prediction phase lags in motion prediction. Existing methods either treat platform motion as a general random process or lack explicit modeling of wave spectral characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance under dynamic sea conditions. To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical control architecture featuring a sampling-based HPO-RRT* algorithm for dynamic trajectory planning under non-convex constraints and a learning-augmented predictive controller that fuses data-driven disturbance compensation with optimization-based execution. Extensive validations (2,000 simulations + 8 lake experiments) show our approach achieves a 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7% / 87.5% success rates (simulation / real-world), and 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 44%-48% in accuracy. Its robustness to wave-wind coupling disturbances supports critical maritime missions such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring. All code, experimental configurations, and datasets will be released as open-source to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: We present a closed-loop framework for autonomous raceline optimization that combines NURBS-based trajectory representation, CMA-ES global trajectory optimization, and controller-guided spatial feedback. Instead of treating tracking errors as transient disturbances, our method exploits them as informative signals of local track characteristics via a Kalman-inspired spatial update. This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction. This demonstrates robustness to changing grip conditions in real-world scenarios.

Method: 本研究提出了一个数据驱动的框架，使用手臂安装的表面肌电图（sEMG）来估计动态、循环pHRI中的疲劳。采用特定于受试者的机器学习回归模型（随机森林、XGBoost和线性回归）从三个频域和一个时域EMG特征预测疲劳周期分数（FCF），并与一个摄入滤波EMG频谱图的卷积神经网络（CNN）进行基准测试。

Result: 在十名参与者的实验中，CNN的平均FCF RMSE为20.8±4.3%，随机森林为23.3±3.8%，XGBoost为24.8±4.5%，线性回归为26.9±6.1%。模型在未经训练的新运动模式上表现出良好的泛化能力，但线性回归表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于特征的机器学习和基于频谱图的深度学习均可用于估计重复性物理人机交互中的剩余工作能力，其中CNN的误差最低，基于树的模型紧随其后。报告中对新运动模式的迁移表明，无需为每个任务重新训练即可实现实用的疲劳监测，从而提高操作员保护并实现疲劳感知的共享自主权，以实现更安全的疲劳适应性pHRI控制。

Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.

Motivation: 现有MAPF和LMAPF研究常假设简化的动力学模型和完美执行，而SMART仅适用于MAPF，无法满足FMS需求。

Method: 提出了LSMART，一个考虑规划与执行并行化、不同规划器假设及恢复机制的模拟器。

Conclusion: LSMART是一个开源模拟器，用于评估FMS中的任何MAPF算法，为设计集中式终身AGV车队管理系统提供了有效指导。

Abstract: We present Lifelong Scalable Multi-Agent Realistic Testbed (LSMART), an open-source simulator to evaluate any Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm in a Fleet Management System (FMS) with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems.

Conclusion: MeshMimic 通过结合3D场景重建和具身智能，直接从视频中学习耦合的“运动-地形”交互，为类人机器人在非结构化环境中的自主进化提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Humanoid motion control has witnessed significant breakthroughs in recent years, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a primary catalyst for achieving complex, human-like behaviors. However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled "motion-terrain" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: 该研究为机器人辅助进食系统在社交用餐环境中的设计提供了关键见解，强调了多模式输入、社交行为敏感性和角色扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Robot-assisted feeding enables people with disabilities who require assistance eating to enjoy a meal independently and with dignity. However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table. Our work has implications for in-the-wild and group contexts of robot-assisted feeding.

Conclusion: FAST-EQA在HMEQA和EXPRESS-Bench上实现了最先进的性能，同时在OpenEQA和MT-HM3D上表现竞争性，显著提升了推理速度和答案可靠性。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) combines visual scene understanding, goal-directed exploration, spatial and temporal reasoning under partial observability. A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations. Furthermore, for real-world deployment, fast inference time during exploration is crucial. We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches. On HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, FAST-EQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, while performing competitively on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D.

Conclusion: Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP) 框架成功实现了人形机器人在复杂环境中自主执行长时程、基于视觉的跑酷动作，展示了高度的动态适应性和自主决策能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.

Conclusion: Dex4D框架展示了在无需微调的情况下，通过零样本迁移实现多样化灵巧操作任务的潜力，并展现出对新物体、场景布局、背景和轨迹的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离网格生成与性能优化，避免了集体通信和全局同步技术，成功生成了高质量的大规模网格（约10亿元素），性能与现有最先进的HPC网格软件相当。

Abstract: This paper presents a distributed memory method for anisotropic mesh adaptation that is designed to avoid the use of collective communication and global synchronization techniques. In the presented method, meshing functionality is separated from performance aspects by utilizing a separate entity for each - a multicore cc-NUMA-based (shared memory) mesh generation software and a parallel runtime system that is designed to help applications leverage the concurrency offered by emerging high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. First, an initial mesh is decomposed and its interface elements (subdomain boundaries) are adapted on a single multicore node (shared memory). Subdomains are then distributed among the nodes of an HPC cluster so that their interior elements are adapted while interface elements (already adapted) remain frozen to maintain mesh conformity. Lessons are presented regarding some re-designs of the shared memory software and how its speculative execution model is utilized by the distributed memory method to achieve good performance. The presented method is shown to generate meshes (of up to approximately 1 billion elements) with comparable quality and performance to existing state-of-the-art HPC meshing software.

Abstract: Removing the CPU from the communication fast path is essential to efficient GPU-based ML and HPC application performance. However, existing GPU communication APIs either continue to rely on the CPU for communication or rely on APIs that place significant synchronization burdens on programmers. In this paper we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of an MPI-based GPU communication API enabling easy-to-use, high-performance, CPU-free communication. This API builds on previously proposed MPI extensions and leverages HPE Slingshot 11 network card capabilities. We demonstrate the utility and performance of the API by showing how the API naturally enables CPU-free gather/scatter halo exchange communication primitives in the Cabana/Kokkos performance portability framework, and through a performance comparison with Cray MPICH on the Frontier and Tuolumne supercomputers. Results from this evaluation show up to a 50% reduction in medium message latency in simple GPU ping-pong exchanges and a 28% speedup improvement when strong scaling a halo-exchange benchmark to 8,192 GPUs of the Frontier supercomputer.

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的规模和复杂性不断增加，使得在内存和计算资源有限的移动GPU上进行设备上推理面临重大挑战。现有的DNN加速框架主要采用权重预加载策略，这在处理大型模型或连续执行多个不同模型时效率不足。

Conclusion: FlashMem通过静态确定模型加载计划和动态按需流式传输权重，显著减少了内存消耗并降低了推理延迟，使得在资源受限的移动GPU上高效执行大规模模型和多DNN支持成为可能。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) pose significant challenges for on-device inference on mobile GPUs, with limited memory and computational resources. Existing DNN acceleration frameworks primarily deploy a weight preloading strategy, where all model parameters are loaded into memory before execution on mobile GPUs. We posit that this approach is not adequate for modern DNN workloads that comprise very large model(s) and possibly execution of several distinct models in succession. In this work, we introduce FlashMem, a memory streaming framework designed to efficiently execute large-scale modern DNNs and multi-DNN workloads while minimizing memory consumption and reducing inference latency. Instead of fully preloading weights, FlashMem statically determines model loading schedules and dynamically streams them on demand, leveraging 2.5D texture memory to minimize data transformations and improve execution efficiency. Experimental results on 11 models demonstrate that FlashMem achieves 2.0x to 8.4x memory reduction and 1.7x to 75.0x speedup compared to existing frameworks, enabling efficient execution of large-scale models and multi-DNN support on resource-constrained mobile GPUs.

Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) integrates different layers of processing infrastructure, from Edge to Cloud, to optimize service quality through ubiquitous and reliable computation. Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.

Motivation: Gliomas are complex and heterogeneous, making treatment challenging. Improved segmentation and survival prediction models are needed to aid in better treatment planning.

Method: The study integrates residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures into a U-Net model to enhance feature representation and segmentation accuracy. It also uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reduce features for survival prediction.

Result: The model achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor segmentation and an accuracy of 45.71% for survival prediction, with additional metrics like MSE and SRC provided.

Conclusion: The proposed Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar model demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction, offering potential benefits for treatment planning.

Abstract: Gliomas, among the most common primary brain tumors, vary widely in aggressiveness, prognosis, and histology, making treatment challenging due to complex and time-intensive surgical interventions. This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset.

Method: 通过重新利用ICML、ICLR和ACL的五篇论文资源，构建了包含39个子任务的五个容器化任务环境，评估代理在提出假设、运行实验和超越人类基线方面的能力。

Result: GPT-5代理仅在15次评估中的1次（6.7%）超越基线11.5%，平均仅完成26.5%的子任务，但在单次运行中成功超越了一个ICML 2025 Spotlight任务的解决方案。

Conclusion: ResearchGym为评估AI代理在端到端研究中的表现提供了系统化的基准和基础设施，揭示了当前前沿代理在长期任务中的能力与可靠性之间的显著差距。

Abstract: We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

TL;DR: Panini提出了一种非参数持续学习框架，通过GSW结构化文档为问答对网络，显著提升QA任务的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成（RAG）方法在测试时计算效率低下和检索无关上下文导致生成不支持的答案的问题。

Method: 提出Panini框架，使用生成语义工作区（GSW）——一个基于实体和事件的问答对网络，支持LLM通过推理链在网络上重构情境和挖掘潜在知识。

Result: 在六个QA基准测试中，Panini平均性能最高，比其他基线高5%-7%，同时使用2-30倍更少的答案上下文令牌，支持完全开源流程，并减少在精选不可回答查询上的不支持答案。

Conclusion: Panini通过GSW框架在写入时高效准确地结构化经验，在读取时实现了效率和可靠性的双重提升。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Result: 提出了da Costian-Tarskianism方法，定义了扩展后果系统和扩展开发图，为处理本体异质性提供了新的工具和框架。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于扩展后果系统和扩展开发图的新方法，为应用本体论领域提供了新的研究方向，并指出了未来研究的可能方向。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity that draws heavily from Carnapian-Goguenism, as presented by Kutz, Mossakowski and Lücke (2010). The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for the field of applied ontology and suggest directions for future research.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在不确定性下的决策行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过比较研究，分析LLMs在风险选择中的行为，涉及20种前沿和开源LLMs，并辅以匹配的人类实验和理性代理模型。

Result: LLMs分为RMs和CMs两类，RMs更理性且不受框架效应影响，CMs更人类化且受框架效应和解释影响。开源LLMs的差异表明数学推理训练是关键因素。

Conclusion: LLMs分为两类：推理模型（RMs）和对话模型（CMs），其中RMs更接近理性行为，而CMs更接近人类行为且受多种因素影响。

Abstract: The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种安全的无线代理AI网络，通过动态分配AI代理进行协作推理，同时利用未被选中的代理作为友好干扰器来保护隐私。实验结果表明，所提出的方案能有效降低网络能耗并保持推理准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合AI和机器学习的框架，能够有效补充确定性算法，实时预测发票稀释，为供应链金融中的非信用风险和利润损失提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Invoice or payment dilution is the gap between the approved invoice amount and the actual collection is a significant source of non credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions. However, IPUs can hinder supply chain finance adoption, particularly among sub-invested grade buyers. A newer, data-driven methods use real-time dynamic credit limits, projecting dilution for each buyer-supplier pair in real-time. This paper introduces an AI, machine learning framework and evaluates how that can supplement a deterministic algorithm to predict invoice dilution using extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于WGAN的联合学习方法，显著提升了合成人口数据的多样性和可行性，适用于基于代理的模型（ABM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成合成人口的方法存在两个主要限制：一是依赖单一数据集或顺序数据融合过程，无法捕捉特征间的复杂交互；二是难以处理采样零和结构零，降低了生成数据的多样性和可行性。

Method: 使用带有梯度惩罚的Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）进行多源数据集的联合学习和合成，通过定义生成器损失函数的正则化项（逆梯度惩罚）来改进数据多样性和可行性。

Result: 提出的联合方法在多样性和可行性上优于顺序基线方法，召回率提高了7%，精确率提高了15%。正则化项进一步提升了多样性和可行性，召回率增加了10%，精确率增加了1%。相似性分布评估中，联合方法总体表现更好，得分为88.1，而顺序方法为84.6。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的联合学习方法通过Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）和梯度惩罚，显著提高了合成数据的多样性和可行性，从而提升了基于代理的模型（ABM）的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\% and precision by 15\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\% increase in recall and 1\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.

Motivation: 探索在变化且不确定的环境中，不同类型的记忆如何帮助空间导航。

Method: 研究了从简单到复杂的多种策略，包括记忆和学习的各种用途，特别是利用非稳态概率学习技术更新记忆，并使用这些记忆构建地图和实时规划。

Result: 发现利用非稳态概率学习技术更新记忆并用于构建地图和规划的智能体，在任务难度增加时（如目标距离增大），只要定位和变化的不确定性不太大，其效率会显著高于简单（最小记忆）智能体。

Conclusion: 需要能够整合多种策略的架构以处理不同性质的子任务，尤其是在探索和搜索食物位置未知时，以及规划到记忆中的（可能）食物位置的路径时。

Abstract: We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.

Abstract: We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

Method: X-MAP结合了SHAP特征归因和非负矩阵分解，构建了可解释的主题配置文件，并使用Jensen-Shannon散度测量消息与这些配置文件的偏差。

Result: 实验显示，误分类消息的偏差至少是正确分类消息的两倍。X-MAP作为检测器，AUROC最高达0.98，并在95% TRR下将误拒率降至0.089。作为修复层，它能恢复高达97%的误拒正确预测。

Conclusion: X-MAP通过结合SHAP特征归因和非负矩阵分解，构建了可解释的主题配置文件，有效提升了垃圾邮件和钓鱼邮件检测的准确性和可解释性。实验结果表明，X-MAP在检测和修复误分类方面表现出色。

Abstract: Misclassifications in spam and phishing detection are very harmful, as false negatives expose users to attacks while false positives degrade trust. Existing uncertainty-based detectors can flag potential errors, but possibly be deceived and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents X-MAP, an eXplainable Misclassification Analysis and Profilling framework that reveals topic-level semantic patterns behind model failures. X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions. When used as a repair layer on base detectors, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage. These results demonstrate X-MAP's effectiveness and interpretability for improving spam and phishing detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业基础模型缺乏基于语言的推理和交互能力，而大语言模型无法直接处理高维异构农业数据，因此需要一种结合两者的框架。

Method: 设计了AgriWorld Python执行环境，提供统一工具进行地理空间查询、遥感时间序列分析、作物生长模拟等，并在此基础上构建了多轮LLM代理Agro-Reflective，通过执行-观察-优化循环迭代分析。

Result: 实验验证了Agro-Reflective在多样化农业QA任务（如查询、预测、异常检测和反事实分析）中的优越性能。

Conclusion: Agro-Reflective框架通过执行驱动的反思机制，显著提升了农业领域推理的可靠性，优于纯文本和直接工具使用基线。

Abstract: Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.

Conclusion: WAC通过整合模型协作、后果模拟和反馈驱动的动作优化，显著提升了Web代理的性能，在VisualWebArena和Online-Mind2Web上分别实现了1.8%和1.3%的绝对增益。

Abstract: Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

Result: 在混合和特定领域工作负载上的广泛评估显示，假阳性显著减少，特别是在医疗建议和创意写作等敏感领域。系统在严格操作模式下保持了高安全精度和近乎完美的召回率。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知弃权框架有效平衡了安全性和实用性，同时保持了性能，为可靠的大语言模型部署提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

Method: 通过逻辑分析和公理扩展，研究了共同信念在KD45情况下的性质。

Result: 发现共同信念的逻辑需要KD4加上shift-reflexivity公理和一个额外依赖于代理数量的公理，从而完全刻画了共同信念。

Conclusion: 论文证明了在KD45情况下，共同信念的逻辑不仅需要KD4加上shift-reflexivity公理，还需要一个额外的公理，且该公理依赖于代理数量。这完全刻画了共同信念，解决了开放性问题。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, common belief is not KD4.
  If individual belief is KD45, common belief does indeed lose the 5 property and keep the D and 4 properties -- and it has none of the other commonly considered properties of knowledge and belief. But it has another property: $C(Cφ\rightarrow φ)$ -- corresponding to so-called shift-reflexivity (reflexivity one step ahead). This observation begs the question:
  is KD4 extended with this axiom a complete characterisation of common belief in the KD45 case? If not, what \emph{is} the logic of common belief? In this paper we show that the answer to the first question is ``no'': there is one additional axiom, and, furthermore, it relies on the number of agents. We show that the result is a complete characterisation of common belief, settling the open problem.

Result: 数据集包含854条解释，涵盖K-12年级的科学、语言和社会科学问题。初步实验显示，EduEVAL-DB可用于评估，且轻量级模型（如Llama 3.1 8B）经微调后能检测 pedagogical risk。

Conclusion: EduEVAL-DB数据集通过提供基于教师角色的解释和 pedagogical risk rubric，为自动教学评估器和AI导师的评估与训练提供了支持。初步验证实验表明，该数据集适用于评估，并能支持在消费级硬件上部署的模型进行 pedagogical risk 检测。

Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.

Result: 结构化能力模型在简约拟合指标上优于潜在因子模型，并在分布外基准预测上优于扩展定律。

Conclusion: 结构化能力模型在量化LLM评估中的构造有效性方面展现出更好的解释和预测能力。

Abstract: The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.
  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.
  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于“黑盒”检索增强生成（RAG）的AI系统缺乏可解释性和隐私保障，用户无法检查或纠正AI的错误行为，且向量数据库的删除操作不彻底。

Method: Ruva 采用个人知识图谱（Personal Knowledge Graph）替代传统的向量数据库，通过图推理（Graph Reasoning）而非向量匹配（Vector Matching）来实现知识检索和编辑。

Result: Ruva 实现了用户对AI知识库的透明化管理和精确编辑，解决了隐私和问责问题。

Conclusion: Ruva 提出了一种“透明盒子”架构，支持用户直接检查和编辑AI的知识库，实现了真正的隐私保护和“被遗忘权”。

Abstract: The Personal AI landscape is currently dominated by "Black Box" Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While standard vector databases offer statistical matching, they suffer from a fundamental lack of accountability: when an AI hallucinates or retrieves sensitive data, the user cannot inspect the cause nor correct the error. Worse, "deleting" a concept from a vector space is mathematically imprecise, leaving behind probabilistic "ghosts" that violate true privacy. We propose Ruva, the first "Glass Box" architecture designed for Human-in-the-Loop Memory Curation. Ruva grounds Personal AI in a Personal Knowledge Graph, enabling users to inspect what the AI knows and to perform precise redaction of specific facts. By shifting the paradigm from Vector Matching to Graph Reasoning, Ruva ensures the "Right to be Forgotten." Users are the editors of their own lives; Ruva hands them the pen.

TL;DR: 研究通过PID Flow框架分析多模态Transformer，发现视觉信息早期主导，后期语言信息主导，跨模态协同作用微弱，且模式高度稳定但任务依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多模态Transformer在回答视觉问题时，预测是依赖于视觉证据、语言推理还是真正的跨模态计算，以及这种结构如何在不同层间演化。

Method: 研究采用了基于部分信息分解（PID）的层析框架，结合降维、正态化流高斯化和闭式高斯PID估计的PID Flow流程。

Result: 研究发现视觉独特信息在早期达到峰值后随深度衰减，语言独特信息在后期层中激增，占最终预测的约82%，而跨模态协同作用始终低于2%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过信息分解框架揭示了多模态Transformer中视觉信息如何转化为语言信息的模式，并提供了识别架构瓶颈的定量指导。

Abstract: When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种预处理方法，通过推断额外的累积约束来捕捉多资源交互，实验证明其能提升搜索性能并优化目标界限，同时发现了新的下界和最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 累积约束在调度问题中至关重要，但传统的传播方法通常逐个约束处理，忽略了多资源之间的交互，导致在某些基准测试中性能严重下降。因此，需要一种预处理方法来捕捉这些交互，而无需在搜索时探测。

Method: 该方法将累积约束解释为占用向量上的线性不等式，并通过以下步骤生成有效不等式：(i)发现无法并行运行的任务集（覆盖集），(ii)通过提升技术加强覆盖不等式，(iii)将生成的约束注入调度问题实例中。

Result: 在标准的RCPSP和RCPSP/max测试套件上的实验表明，推断的约束提高了搜索性能并优化了目标界限。此外，还发现了25个新的下界和5个新的最优解，其中8个下界直接来自推断的约束。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的预处理方法通过推断额外的累积约束来捕捉多资源交互，从而提高了搜索性能并优化了目标界限。实验结果表明，该方法在有利实例上表现良好，同时在不有利实例上几乎没有负面影响。此外，该方法还发现了25个新的下界和5个新的最优解。

Abstract: Cumulative constraints are central in scheduling with constraint programming, yet propagation is typically performed per constraint, missing multi-resource interactions and causing severe slowdowns on some benchmarks. I present a preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints that capture such interactions without search-time probing. This approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors and generates valid inequalities by (i) discovering covers, the sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel, (ii) strengthening the cover inequalities for the discovered sets with lifting, and (iii) injecting the resulting constraints back into the scheduling problem instance. Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones. Additionally, these experiments discover 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions; eight of the lower bounds are obtained directly from the inferred constraints.

TL;DR: CARE Drive是一个模型无关框架，通过上下文扰动评估视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的决策是否响应人类理由，发现人类理由能改善决策对齐，但对不同理由的敏感性不均。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注结果性能（如安全和轨迹准确性），未验证模型决策是否真正反映人类相关考虑，可能导致安全关键领域产生虚假信心。

Method: CARE Drive采用两阶段评估流程：提示校准确保输出稳定，系统上下文扰动测量决策对人类理由（如安全边际、社会压力和效率约束）的敏感性。

Result: 结果显示，明确的人类理由显著影响模型决策，提升与专家行为的一致性，但对不同类型理由的敏感性不均。

Conclusion: CARE Drive框架能够在不修改模型参数的情况下，系统评估基础模型（如视觉语言模型）在自动驾驶中的决策是否真正响应人类相关考虑，从而提升模型与专家推荐行为的一致性。

Abstract: Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

TL;DR: PERSONA是一种无需训练的人格控制框架，通过激活空间向量操作实现动态和组合性人格调整，性能接近微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型人格控制方法依赖静态提示或昂贵微调，无法捕捉人类特质的动态和组合性。

Method: PERSONA框架分为三个阶段：Persona-Base通过对比激活分析提取正交特质向量；Persona-Algebra通过向量算术（标量乘法调节强度、加法组合、减法抑制）实现精确控制；Persona-Flow在推理时动态组合这些向量以实现上下文感知适应。

Result: 在PersonalityBench上平均得分9.60，接近监督微调上限9.61；在Persona-Evolve动态适应基准上，跨模型家族胜率高达91%。

Conclusion: PERSONA框架通过激活空间中直接操作人格向量，无需训练即可达到微调级别的性能，为LLM人格控制提供了新的可解释和高效方向。

Abstract: Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

Motivation: 现有方法在组合推理任务上表现不佳，因为它们无法动态调整模型的潜在表示空间。

Method: 提出Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE)框架，通过动态生成低秩概念子空间、选择、合并和优化来修改模型的内部表示几何。

Result: 在多个组合推理基准测试中，RCE显著提升了性能，如ARC-AGI-2提升12-18点，GPQA和BBH提升8-14点。

Conclusion: RCE框架通过动态生成低秩概念子空间，显著提升了大型语言模型在组合推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.

Motivation: 多智能体系统中部分可观测性是协调与决策的关键障碍，现有方法（如信念状态估计和智能体间通信）未能充分利用全局信息或缺乏鲁棒模型。

Method: 提出Global State Diffusion Algorithm（GlobeDiff），将状态推断过程建模为多模态扩散过程，克服状态估计中的模糊性。

Result: 理论证明GlobeDiff在单模态和多模态分布下的估计误差有界，实验表明其能准确推断全局状态且性能优越。

Conclusion: GlobeDiff算法通过多模态扩散过程有效解决了多智能体系统中的部分可观测性问题，能够高保真地推断全局状态，并在理论和实验上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.

Conclusion: 本文强调了在社会科学实验中使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为合成参与者时，需要明确其推断人类行为的有效性条件，并对比了启发式方法和统计校准策略的适用场景。

Abstract: A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study.

Motivation: 传统编码方法（如one-hot）无法准确表达密切相关的子类型之间的细微关系，限制了AI的语义理解能力。为了克服这一限制，研究探索了LLM嵌入作为编码的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的编码方法在提升AI对建筑语义理解方面的潜力，尤其是在处理复杂领域特定语义时的优势。随着LLM和降维技术的进步，这种方法在AECO行业中有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Accurate representation of building semantics, encompassing both generic object types and specific subtypes, is essential for effective AI model training in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.

Result: 通过理论分析和仿真验证，揭示了系统参数变化时的性能权衡，并提出了实用的部署建议。

Conclusion: 论文通过分析不同监测模式（IoT传感器、UAV和卫星）的信息时效性（AoI），提出了优化策略和性能权衡，为实际部署提供了关键见解。

Abstract: We investigate a remote monitoring framework with multiple sensing modalities including IoT sensors on the ground, mobile UAVs in the air, and a periodically available satellite constellation. While the IoT sensors cover small areas and remain fixed, the UAVs can move between locations and cover larger areas, and the satellites can observe the entire region but have high latency and low reliability. We divide the deployment region into cells and model it as a graph, with the nodes representing individual cells and edges representing possible UAV mobility patterns. To evaluate the freshness of collected information from this graph, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) metric, measured separately for each cell. Under a given deployment of IoT nodes and UAV mobility patterns, our objective is to ascertain whether the system should actually utilize monitoring updates from satellites - a seemingly simple yet surprisingly elusive question. For stationary randomized scheduling policies, we develop closed-form expressions and lower bounds for the weighted-sum AoI and utilize this analysis to explore performance tradeoffs as system parameters vary. We also provide a Lyapunov style max-weight policy and detailed simulations that provide crucial insights for deploying such systems in practice.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于Tail-Risk Envelopes（TREs）的AIaaS管理平面，通过确定性护栏和随机速率-延迟-损伤模型的结合，实现了多域联邦下的高保真度控制与编排。

Abstract: To support the emergence of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), communication service providers (CSPs) are on the verge of a radical transformation-from pure connectivity providers to AIaaS a managed network service (control-and-orchestration plane that exposes AI models). In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness.

Result: 原型评估了事务延迟、重定位中断、租约到期下的执行正确性，以及移动性和故障下的审计证据开销。

Conclusion: AI-Paging架构通过现有的控制面和用户面机制实现，确保了与现有3GPP架构的兼容性，并在动态网络条件下提供了AIaaS服务的连续性和可靠性。

Abstract: With AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) now deployed across multiple providers and model tiers, selecting the appropriate model instance at run time is increasingly outside the end user's knowledge and operational control. Accordingly, the 6G service providers are envisioned to play a crucial role in exposing AIaaS in a setting where users submit only an intent while the network helps in the intent-to-model matching (resolution) and execution placement under policy, trust, and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures.

Abstract: Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference is increasingly latency- and context-sensitive, yet today's AI-as-a-Service is typically consumed as an application-chosen endpoint, leaving the network to provide only best-effort transport. This decoupling prevents enforceable tail-latency guarantees, compute-aware admission control, and continuity under mobility. This paper proposes Network-Exposed AI-as-a-Service (NE-AIaaS) built around a new service primitive: the AI Session (AIS)-a contractual object that binds model identity, execution placement, transport Quality-of-Service (QoS), and consent/charging scope into a single lifecycle with explicit failure semantics. We introduce the AI Service Profile (ASP), a compact contract that expresses task modality and measurable service objectives (e.g., time-to-first-response/token, p99 latency, success probability) alongside privacy and mobility constraints. On this basis, we specify protocol-grade procedures for (i) DISCOVER (model/site discovery), (ii) AI PAGING (context-aware selection of execution anchor), (iii) two-phase PREPARE/COMMIT that atomically co-reserves compute and QoS resources, and (iv) make-before-break MIGRATION for session continuity. The design is standard-mappable to Common API Framework (CAPIF) style northbound exposure, ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) execution substrates, 5G QoS flows for transport enforcement, and Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) style analytics for closed-loop paging/migration triggers.
