In the presented method, meshing functionality is separated from performance aspects by utilizing a separate entity for each - a multicore cc-NUMA-based (shared memory) mesh generation software and a parallel runtime system that is designed to help applications leverage the concurrency offered by emerging high-performance computing (HPC) architectures. First, an initial mesh is decomposed and its interface elements (subdomain boundaries) are adapted on a single multicore node (shared memory). Subdomains are then distributed among the nodes of an HPC cluster so that their interior elements are adapted while interface elements (already adapted) remain frozen to maintain mesh conformity. Lessons are presented regarding some re-designs of the shared memory software and how its speculative execution model is utilized by the distributed memory method to achieve good performance. The presented method is shown to generate meshes (of up to approximately 1 billion elements) with comparable quality and performance to existing state-of-the-art HPC meshing software.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u5c40\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7f51\u683c\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6838cc-NUMA\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\uff09\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u521d\u59cb\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u89e3\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u591a\u6838\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u9002\u914d\u63a5\u53e3\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5206\u53d1\u5b50\u57df\u81f3HPC\u96c6\u7fa4\u8282\u70b9\u9002\u914d\u5185\u90e8\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u53e3\u5143\u7d20\u51bb\u7ed3\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7ea610\u4ebf\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684HPC\u7f51\u683c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u540c\u6b65\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u7ea610\u4ebf\u5143\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684HPC\u7f51\u683c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

Existing DNN acceleration frameworks primarily deploy a weight preloading strategy, where all model parameters are loaded into memory before execution on mobile GPUs. We posit that this approach is not adequate for modern DNN workloads that comprise very large model(s) and possibly execution of several distinct models in succession. In this work, we introduce FlashMem, a memory streaming framework designed to efficiently execute large-scale modern DNNs and multi-DNN workloads while minimizing memory consumption and reducing inference latency. Instead of fully preloading weights, FlashMem statically determines model loading schedules and dynamically streams them on demand, leveraging 2.5D texture memory to minimize data transformations and improve execution efficiency. Experimental results on 11 models demonstrate that FlashMem achieves 2.0x to 8.4x memory reduction and 1.7x to 75.0x speedup compared to existing frameworks, enabling efficient execution of large-scale models and multi-DNN support on resource-constrained mobile GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashMem\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u5b58\u6d41\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u5229\u75282.5D\u7eb9\u7406\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DNN\u548c\u591aDNN\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5728\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNNs\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684DNN\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u6267\u884c\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "FlashMem\u91c7\u75282.5D\u7eb9\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashMem\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.0\u500d\u52308.4\u500d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u548c1.7\u500d\u523075.0\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591aDNN\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashMem\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u8f7d\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6309\u9700\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591aDNN\u652f\u6301\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation.

Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\uff08CC\uff09\u6574\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u5230\u4e91\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7f16\u6392\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u670d\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u672a\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\uff08CC\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4ece\u8fb9\u7f18\u5230\u4e91\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5c42\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e2d\u592e\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86CC\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u60f3\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8CC\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u670d\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u89e3\u91ca\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u670d\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u65e0\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7f16\u6392\u673a\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5171\u540c\u52fe\u52d2\u51faCC\u4e2d\u5f39\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7f16\u6392\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}

While promising to compress research timelines from years to weeks, their deployment introduces unprecedented safety challenges differing from traditional laboratories or purely digital AI. This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles. Evaluation against the LabSafety Bench reveals that current foundation models exhibit significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential rather than optional. Our framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for safe deployment of autonomous scientific systems, establishing the groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Safe-SDL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7ODDs\u3001CBFs\u548cCRUTD\u534f\u8bae\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u52a0\u901f\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDLs\uff09\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u2018\u8bed\u6cd5\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u2018\u8bed\u6cd5\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u9e3f\u6c9f\u2019\uff1a(1) \u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57df\uff08ODDs\uff09\uff0c(2) \u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\uff0c(3) \u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\uff08CRUTD\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Safe-SDL\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u79d1\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u52a0\u901f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our solutions improve over the best known running times for these problems in terms of the worst-case time per letter, for which we achieve a poly-log-logarithmic time complexity, within a linear space.

Brinton"], "title": "Exploring Performance Tradeoffs in Age-Aware Remote Monitoring with Satellites", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate a remote monitoring framework with multiple sensing modalities including IoT sensors on the ground, mobile UAVs in the air, and a periodically available satellite constellation. While the IoT sensors cover small areas and remain fixed, the UAVs can move between locations and cover larger areas, and the satellites can observe the entire region but have high latency and low reliability. We divide the deployment region into cells and model it as a graph, with the nodes representing individual cells and edges representing possible UAV mobility patterns. To evaluate the freshness of collected information from this graph, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) metric, measured separately for each cell. Under a given deployment of IoT nodes and UAV mobility patterns, our objective is to ascertain whether the system should actually utilize monitoring updates from satellites - a seemingly simple yet surprisingly elusive question.

In circuit analysis, for example, a numerically correct solution is insufficient if it violates established methodological conventions such as mesh directionality or polarity assignments, errors that can propagate in safety-critical systems. Yet it remains unclear whether frontier models truly apply first-principles reasoning or rely on entrenched training priors that conflict with explicit instructions. We introduce CircuChain, a diagnostic benchmark designed to disentangle instruction compliance from physical reasoning competence in electrical circuit analysis. CircuChain consists of counterbalanced Control/Trap problem pairs across five canonical circuit topologies, augmented with systematic variations in sign conventions, current orientations, and polarity definitions. A multi-stage verification pipeline, combining symbolic solvers, SPICE simulation, and an LLM-based error taxonomy, enables fine-grained attribution of failures to convention errors, physics errors, arithmetic mistakes, or hallucinations. Across 100 tasks per model, we observe a consistent Compliance-Competence Divergence. The strongest model evaluated exhibits near-perfect physical reasoning but a high rate of convention violations when Trap conditions deliberately invert natural sign patterns. Conversely, weaker models display lower physical fidelity yet superior adherence to explicit instructions. These results suggest that increased model capability does not guarantee improved constraint alignment and highlight the need for new evaluation frameworks that stress instruction-following under mathematically rigid domains.

Given a triplet $\\{\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{a}'$, $\\mathbf{b}\\}$, the goal is to generate $\\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\\mathbf{a} : \\mathbf{a}' :: \\mathbf{b} : \\mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a \"space of LoRAs\". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations.

Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways.

Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs are transforming the fundamentals of HRI by reshaping how robots sense context, generate socially grounded interactions, and maintain continuous alignment with human needs in embodied settings; and (2) current research is largely exploratory, with different studies focusing on different facets of LLM-driven HRI, resulting in wide-ranging choices of experimental setups, study methods, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we identify key design considerations and challenges, offering a coherent overview and guidelines for future research at the intersection of LLMs and HRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851HRI\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8HRI\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7279\u70b9\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6280\u672f\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4eba\u672c\u5f71\u54cd\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7528\u6237\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684HRI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9075\u5faaPRISMA\u6307\u5357\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa86\u7bc7\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u3001\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9700\u6c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8HRI\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff1b(2) \u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8LLM\u9a71\u52a8HRI\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86LLM\u5728HRI\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6982\u8ff0\u548c\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

It has been shown that the decision problem for finding an integer array of length $\\ell+\u03c1$ or restricting the shift function up to values of $\u03c1$ is NP-complete (cf. the textbook of Garey and Johnson). As a practical heuristic, a greedy algorithm has been proposed to shift the $i$-th row until it forms a solution with its predecessor rows. Despite that this greedy algorithm is cherished for its good approximation in practice, we show that it actually exhibits an approximation ratio of $\u0398(\\sqrt{\\ell+\u03c1})$. We give further hardness results for parameterizations such as the number of distinct rows or the maximum number of non-zero entries per row. Finally, we devise a DP-algorithm that solves the problem for double-logarithmic matrix widths or logarithmic widths for further restrictions. We study all these findings also under a new perspective by introducing a variant of the problem, where we wish to minimize the length of the resulting integer array by trimming the non-zero borders, which has not been studied in the literature before but has practical motivations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e3a\u0398(\u221a(\u2113+\u03c1))\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u8bc1\u660e\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684NP-\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4e3a\u0398(\u221a(\u2113+\u03c1))\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u5bf9\u6570\u6216\u5bf9\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u975e\u96f6\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6574\u6570\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTREs\u7684AIaaS\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u6f14\u7b97\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u57df\u8054\u90a6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u652f\u6301AI-as-a-Service\uff08AIaaS\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff08CSPs\uff09\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7eaf\u8fde\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3aAIaaS\u7ba1\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u57df\u8054\u90a6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7f16\u6392\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u6f14\u7b97\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8de8\u4e32\u8054\u57df\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdd\u53cd\u6982\u7387\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u7ea7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8fc7\u8f7d\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u79df\u6237\u9694\u79bb\u6539\u5584\u4e86p99.9\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTail-Risk Envelopes\uff08TREs\uff09\u7684AIaaS\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u62a4\u680f\u548c\u968f\u673a\u901f\u7387-\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u635f\u4f24\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u57df\u8054\u90a6\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7f16\u6392\u3002"}}

While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining.

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap.

For constant $\\varepsilon$, we also prove an $\u03a9(\\sqrt n)$ lower bound for randomized adaptive one-sided testers on explicit bipartite DAGs, whereas previously only an $\u03a9(\\log n)$ lower bound was known.

Accordingly, the 6G service providers are envisioned to play a crucial role in exposing AIaaS in a setting where users submit only an intent while the network helps in the intent-to-model matching (resolution) and execution placement under policy, trust, and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI-Paging\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u4ea4\u6613\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u4e3aAI\u670d\u52a1\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bAIaaS\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AIaaS\u5728\u591a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c6G\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u9700\u8981\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6267\u884c\u653e\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI-Paging\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u63a7\u5236\u3001QoS\u6d41\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e8b\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u79df\u7ea6\u5230\u671f\u4e0b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u4e0b\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc1\u636e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "AI-Paging\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9762\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9762\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u67093GPP\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86AIaaS\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence.

Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e29\u5ba4\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u7ef4\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u586b\u8865\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d2\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6e29\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u519c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

This paper takes a cross-stack perspective, examining how generative models are being applied from code generation and distributed runtimes through hardware design space exploration to RTL synthesis, physical layout, and verification. Rather than reviewing each layer in isolation, we analyze how the same structural difficulties and effective responses recur across the stack. Our central finding is one of convergence. Despite the diversity of domains and tools, the field keeps encountering five recurring challenges (the feedback loop crisis, the tacit knowledge problem, trust and validation, co-design across boundaries, and the shift from determinism to dynamism) and keeps arriving at five design principles that independently emerge as effective responses (embracing hybrid approaches, designing for continuous feedback, separating concerns by role, matching methods to problem structure, and building on decades of systems knowledge). We organize these into a challenge--principle map that serves as a diagnostic and design aid, showing which principles have proven effective for which challenges across layers. Through concrete cross-stack examples, we show how systems navigate this map as they mature, and argue that the field needs shared engineering methodology, including common vocabularies, cross-layer benchmarks, and systematic design practices, so that progress compounds across communities rather than being rediscovered in each one. Our analysis covers more than 275 papers spanning eleven application areas across three layers of the computing stack, and distills open research questions that become visible only from a cross-layer vantage point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8de8\u5806\u6808\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u5927\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4e94\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5efa\u7acb\u5171\u4eab\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u793e\u533a\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u82af\u7247\u8bbe\u8ba1\u793e\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ecd\u7136\u5206\u6563\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8de8\u5806\u6808\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5171\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u96be\u9898\u548c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u8fc7275\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5806\u6808\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u6311\u6218-\u539f\u5219\u6620\u5c04\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u4e94\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff08\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u5371\u673a\u3001\u9690\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u8de8\u8fb9\u754c\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff09\u548c\u4e94\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6301\u7eed\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u6309\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u79bb\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3001\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u5728\u5806\u6808\u5404\u5c42\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u5806\u6808\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e94\u5927\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4e94\u5927\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5efa\u7acb\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u793e\u533a\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7d2f\u79ef\u6837\u672c\u635f\u5931\uff08CSL\uff09\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5065\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u9519\u4e71\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7d2f\u79ef\u6837\u672c\u635f\u5931\uff08CSL\uff09\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u5728EgoPER\u548cCholec80\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u9519\u4e71\u7b49\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5ba1\u6838\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.\n  We propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment.

Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy. Each code smell category includes over 10,000 labeled samples.

Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts.

The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting.

Streaming imagery to control connected vehicles remotely currently requires a reliable, high throughput network connection, which can be limited in real-world remote operation deployments relying on public network infrastructure. This paper investigates how the application of computer vision assisted semantic communication can be used to circumvent data loss and corruption associated with traditional image compression techniques. By encoding the segmentations of detected road users into colour coded highlights within low resolution greyscale imagery, the required data rate can be reduced by 50 \\% compared with conventional techniques, while maintaining visual clarity. This enables a median glass-to-glass latency of below 200ms even when the network data rate is below 500kbit/s, while clearly outlining salient road users to enhance situational awareness of the remote operator. The approach is demonstrated in an area of variable 4G mobile connectivity using an automated last-mile delivery vehicle.

While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations.

Outcome of a master and bachelor student project completed in Visual and Spatial AI Lab at TAMU", "summary": "Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u673a\u865a\u62df\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u975e\u521a\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5feb\u901f\u975e\u521a\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u795e\u7ecf\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u540c\u6b65\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u56de\u6eaf\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u673a\u865a\u62df\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u80b2\u76f4\u64ad\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap.

However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "OSCAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4ea7\u5375\u5668\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ed3\u80a0\u7684\u6ed1\u817b\u3001\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u5bc4\u751f\u8702\u7684\u4ea7\u5375\u5668\u8fd0\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8212\u9002\u7684\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "method": "OSCAR\u91c7\u7528\u5f39\u7c27\u52a0\u8f7d\u7684\u51f8\u8f6e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a71\u52a8\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5468\u5411\u6ed1\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542bKelvin-Voigt\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6ed1\u5757\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7c98\u5f39\u6027\u7c98\u6ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "OSCAR\u5728\u79bb\u4f53\u732a\u7ed3\u80a0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7a33\u6001\u7275\u5f15\u529b\u4e3a0.85 N\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a3.08 mm/s\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u4f20\u7edf\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u76f2\u80a0\u63d2\u7ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "OSCAR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u6cd5\u5411\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u529b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80f6\u56ca\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u68c0\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

In our model, dubbed LNDP, each node sees its own edge list and releases the output of a local randomizer on this input. These outputs are aggregated by an untrusted server to obtain a final output.\n  We develop a novel algorithmic framework for this setting that allows us to accurately answer arbitrary linear queries on a blurry approximation of the input graph's degree distribution. For some natural problems, the resulting algorithms match the accuracy achievable with node privacy in the central model, where data are held and processed by a trusted server. We also prove lower bounds on the error required by LNDP that imply the optimality of our algorithms for several fundamental graph statistics.

To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions.

Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes.

These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "FABCO\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u6f14\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "FABCO\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8865\u5145\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f14\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cFABCO\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc73.2\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "FABCO\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u65e0\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.2\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002"}}

Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7814\u7a76VLMs\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06VLMs\u7f6e\u4e8e\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6270\u52a8\u5176\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u7528\u3002\u4ece\u5e38\u89c1\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5982\u4ea7\u54c1\u7167\u7247\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5934\u5bf9\u5934\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cfAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWGAN\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u53e3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08ABM\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u987a\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u96f6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u96f6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684Wasserstein\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08WGAN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u5668\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff08\u9006\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8615%\u3002\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4e8610%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u4e861%\u3002\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a88.1\uff0c\u800c\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a84.6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7Wasserstein\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08WGAN\uff09\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08ABM\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408NMPC\u3001Zernike\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u810a\u67f1\u836f\u7269\u9012\u9001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8367\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMPC\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eZernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u5fae\u5206\u78c1\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ebf\u5708\u7535\u6d41\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u57283 Hz\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u548c2 mm\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u810a\u67f1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u836f\u7269\u9012\u9001\u7684RMS\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.18 mm\uff0c\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u907f\u5f00\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u810a\u67f1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\u9012\u9001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models are used to extract signals and behavioral logic to automatically generate Gherkin scenarios, which are then converted into runnable test scripts. The Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration standardizes signal references, supporting portability across subsystems and test benches. The pipeline uses retrieval-augmented generation to preselect candidate VSS signals before mapping. We evaluate the approach on the safety-relevant Child Presence Detection System, executing the generated tests in a virtual environment and on an actual vehicle. Our evaluation covers Gherkin validity, VSS mapping quality, and end-to-end executability. Results show that 32 of 36 requirements (89\\%) can be transformed into executable scenarios in our setting, while human review and targeted substitutions remain necessary.

In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness.

In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5230\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5229\u7528\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u5927\uff09\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u592a\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u7387\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u98df\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c4\u5212\u5230\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\uff09\u98df\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u65f6\u3002"}}

Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \\textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \\textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks.

While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u786e\u4fddLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08differential fuzzing\uff09\u6765\u68c0\u67e5LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u79cdLLM\uff08CodeLlama\u3001Codestral\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b019-35%\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u975e\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e1421%\u672a\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision.

The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift.

X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions.

Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis.

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop.

However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors.

However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain.

Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench.

Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems.

In this work, we focus on accelerating policy training using a library-based initialization scheme that enables effective knowledge transfer across multirotor configurations. By leveraging a physics-aware neural control architecture that combines a reinforcement learning-based controller and a supervised control allocation network, we enable the reuse of previously trained policies. To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm that our control architecture achieves state-of-the-art control performance, and that our initialization scheme saves on average up to $73.5\\%$ of environment interactions (compared to training a policy from scratch) across diverse quadrotor and hexarotor designs, paving the way for efficient cross-embodiment transfer in reinforcement learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4f53\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u5927\u91cf\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4f53\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u914d\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4ece\u5e93\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u7701\u4e8673.5%\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e93\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u65cb\u7ffc\u914d\u7f6e\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u624b\u8155\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u8870\u51cf\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u6548\u7528\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ec5\u5411\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "GMAIL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46 indiscriminate \u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd discriminative \u5730\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGMAIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "GMAIL\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6b63\u7f29\u653e\u8d8b\u52bf\u53ca\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982LLaVA\uff09\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GMAIL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u4e8e\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation.

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory.

Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u663c\u591c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u663c\u591c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5927\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u5934\u9274\u522b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u539f\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Schrodinger Bridge\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728BDD100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663c\u591c\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2dmAP\u63d0\u5347\u4e8615.5%\uff0c\u5bf9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u706f\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe31.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u663c\u591c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6784\u9020\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u662f\u8861\u91cfLLM\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6784\u9020\u6709\u6548\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u5927\u91cfLLM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u7ea6\u62df\u5408\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cf\u5316LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u9020\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies.

We propose Adjoint Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths.

Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between \"grip\" and \"slip\" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks.

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability.

We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%.

Existing methods either treat platform motion as a general random process or lack explicit modeling of wave spectral characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance under dynamic sea conditions. To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical control architecture featuring a sampling-based HPO-RRT* algorithm for dynamic trajectory planning under non-convex constraints and a learning-augmented predictive controller that fuses data-driven disturbance compensation with optimization-based execution. Extensive validations (2,000 simulations + 8 lake experiments) show our approach achieves a 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7% / 87.5% success rates (simulation / real-world), and 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 44%-48% in accuracy.

These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach.

Instead of treating tracking errors as transient disturbances, our method exploits them as informative signals of local track characteristics via a Kalman-inspired spatial update. This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction.

This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel \"Castle-Moat-Rampart\" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons.

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations.

This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8esEMG\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001pHRI\u4e2d\u7684\u808c\u8089\u75b2\u52b3\uff0cCNN\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u808c\u8089\u75b2\u52b3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08pHRI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u81c2\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u56fe\uff08sEMG\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5faa\u73afpHRI\u4e2d\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u9891\u57df\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u57dfEMG\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u75b2\u52b3\u5468\u671f\u5206\u6570\uff08FCF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6444\u5165\u6ee4\u6ce2EMG\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCNN\u7684\u5e73\u5747FCF RMSE\u4e3a20.8\u00b14.3%\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u4e3a23.3\u00b13.8%\uff0cXGBoost\u4e3a24.8\u00b14.5%\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e3a26.9\u00b16.1%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u7ecf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5747\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u5de5\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCNN\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6700\u4f4e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7d27\u968f\u5176\u540e\u3002\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u65b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4fdd\u62a4\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u75b2\u52b3\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u9002\u5e94\u6027pHRI\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates.

MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems.

However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures.

Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks.

However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled \"motion-terrain\" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains.

However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e3b\u9898-\u98ce\u683c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408LoRA\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u4e86LoRA\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u521d\u8877\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u9898-\u98ce\u683c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684LoRA\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u9898-\u98ce\u683c\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684LoRA\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u5408\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u3002"}}

Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "PADE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LVLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0b\u6c89\u73b0\u8c61\u8106\u5f31\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800cLVLMs\u5185\u90e8\u7684PAD\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPADE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efaPAD\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u6bcf\u5934\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u7edd\u5bf9\u504f\u5dee\u7f29\u653e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee4\u724c\u8865\u507f\u7ef4\u6301\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLVLMs\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPADE\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "PADE\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LVLMs\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations.

A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations. Furthermore, for real-world deployment, fast inference time during exploration is crucial. We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding.

In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "PHP \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u8dd1\u9177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u654f\u6377\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8dd1\u9177\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4f4e\u5c42\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\u7ec4\u5408\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u751f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Unitree G1 \u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe 1.25 \u7c73\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u6500\u722c\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u591a\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7a7f\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP) \u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u6267\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8dd1\u9177\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos.

However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEMRAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u5f71\u50cf\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u7b26\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConcept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-CXR\u548cIU X-Ray\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCEMRAG\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6807\u51c6NLP\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u548c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CEMRAG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001RAG\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product.

However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%.

Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations.

Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function.

Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale.

Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency.

As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework.

To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \\pm 1.5$ ($\\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \\pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \\pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \\times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs.

We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\\% vs.\\ 62.5\\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARL-XRay\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6216\u964d\u4f4e\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08CARL-XRay\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56fa\u5b9a\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u589e\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u53ca\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u3002", "result": "CARL-XRay\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6444\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0875.0% vs. 62.5%\uff09\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUROC 0.74-0.75\uff09\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "CARL-XRay\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\u7b14\u753b\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8349\u56fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u521b\u610f\u7ed8\u56fe\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b14\u753b\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u8349\u56fe\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u7b14\u753b\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u624b\u5de5\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6781\u5c11\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7ed8\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}
