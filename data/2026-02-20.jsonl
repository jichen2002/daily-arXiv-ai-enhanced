On large highway and bridge projects, this delay limits early intervention and increases the risk of rework, schedule impacts, and fragmented documentation. This study presents a construction-phase digital twin framework designed to support element-level QA and readiness-based decision making during active construction. The framework links inspection records, material production and placement data, early-age sensing, and predictive strength models to individual construction elements. By integrating these data streams, the system represents the evolving quality state of each element and supports structured release or hold decisions before standard-age test results are available. The approach does not replace established inspection and testing procedures. Instead, it supplements existing workflows by improving traceability and enabling earlier, data-informed quality assessments. Practical considerations related to data integration, contractual constraints, and implementation challenges are also discussed. The proposed framework provides a structured pathway for transitioning construction QA from delayed, document-driven review toward proactive, element-level decision support during construction."}

In contrast, in real use, these agents solve more various and complex tasks that involve other skills such as exploring codebases, testing software, and designing architecture. In this paper, we first characterize some transferable skills that are shared across diverse tasks by decomposing trajectories into fine-grained components, and derive a set of principles for designing auxiliary training tasks to teach language models these skills. Guided by these principles, we propose a training environment, Hybrid-Gym, consisting of a set of scalable synthetic tasks, such as function localization and dependency search. Experiments show that agents trained on our synthetic tasks effectively generalize to diverse real-world tasks that are not present in training, improving a base model by 25.4% absolute gain on SWE-Bench Verified, 7.9% on SWT-Bench Verified, and 5.1% on Commit-0 Lite. Hybrid-Gym also complements datasets built for the downstream tasks (e.g., improving SWE-Play by 4.9% on SWT-Bench Verified). Code available at: https://github.com/yiqingxyq/Hybrid-Gym."}

We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained. Using repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling on a representative sample of 396 plugins, we identify six topics related to knowledge management and tooling, which is (i) dynamic editing and organization, (ii) interface and layouts, (iii) creative writing and productivity, (iv) knowledge sync solutions, (v) linking and script tools, and (vi) workflow enhancements tools. Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem. These findings suggest that even in mixed communities, plugin ecosystems can develop recognizable engineering structures, motivating future work that highlight three different research directions with six research questions related to the health and sustainability of these non-developer ecosystems."}

Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution."}

However, existing 3D generation methods are limited to handling a single control objective and lack the ability to utilize multiple images to independently control different regions of a 3D asset, which hinders their flexibility in applications. We propose Fuse3D, a novel method that enables generating 3D assets under the control of multiple images, allowing for the seamless fusion of multi-level regional controls from global views to intricate local details. First, we introduce a Multi-Condition Fusion Module to integrate the visual features from multiple image regions. Then, we propose a method to automatically align user-selected 2D image regions with their associated 3D regions based on semantic cues. Finally, to resolve control conflicts and enhance local control features from multi-condition images, we introduce a Local Attention Enhancement Strategy that flexibly balances region-specific feature fusion. Overall, we introduce the first method capable of controllable 3D asset generation from multiple condition images. The experimental results indicate that Fuse3D can flexibly fuse multiple 2D image regions into coherent 3D structures, resulting in high-quality 3D assets.

Existing RAN slicing frameworks predominantly rely on per-slice resource reservation, which ensures performance isolation but leads to inefficient utilization, particularly under bursty traffic. We introduce HyRA, a hybrid resource allocation framework for RAN slicing that combines dedicated per-slice allocations with shared resource pooling across slices. HyRA preserves performance isolation while improving resource efficiency by leveraging multiplexing gains in bursty traffic conditions. We formulate this design as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, where the outer loop determines the dedicated and shared resource budgets and the inner loop performs per-UE scheduling under a novel water-filling approach. By using the sample-average approximation, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the inner loop, and Big-M encoding, we transform the problem into a tractable mixed-integer program that standard optimization solvers can solve. Extensive simulations under diverse demand patterns, SLA configurations, and traffic burstiness show that HyRA achieves up to 50-75% spectrum savings compared to dedicated-only and shared-only baselines. These results highlight HyRA as a viable approach for resource-efficient, SLA-compliant RAN slicing in future mobile networks."}

Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time.

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\n  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that Fed-PLoRA consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

The r-index and its derivatives combine the run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) with suffix array sampling to achieve space proportional to the number of equal-symbol runs in the BWT. While effective for near-identical strings, their size grows quickly as variation increases, since the number of BWT runs is sensitive to edits. Existing approaches typically trade space for query speed, or vice versa, limiting their practicality at large scale.\n  We introduce variable-length blocking (VLB), an encoding technique for BWT-based CSAs that adapts the amount of indexing information to local compressibility. The BWT is recursively divided into blocks of at most w runs (a parameter) and organized into a tree. Compressible regions appear near the root and store little auxiliary data, while incompressible regions lie deeper and retain additional information to speed up access. Queries traverse a short root-to-leaf path followed by a small run scan. This strategy balances space and query speed by transferring bits saved in compressible areas to accelerate access in incompressible ones.\n  Backward search relies on rank and successor queries over the BWT. We introduce a sampling technique that guarantees correctness only along valid backward-search states, reducing space without affecting query performance.\n  We extend VLB to encode the subsampled r-index (sr-index). Experiments show that VLB-based techniques outperform the r-index and sr-index in query time, while retaining space close to that of the sr-index. Compared to the move data structure, VLB offers a more favorable space-time tradeoff."}

While such data can be obtained through Internet Service Provider (ISP) web interfaces, these workloads impose three fundamental system requirements: robustness to frequent interface evolution, extensibility across hundreds of providers, and low technical overhead for non-expert users. Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements.\n  We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications. BQT+ models querying intent as an interaction state space, formalized as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and selects execution paths at runtime to accommodate alternative interaction flows and localized interface changes.

By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation.

Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion.

We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages.\n  Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines."}

Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation."}

This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters.

In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity.

Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.\n  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible.

Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms).

To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics. We quantify semantic fairness using a Coverage Disparity Index (CDI), which measures the alignment between coverage and error. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SemCovNet enhances model reliability and substantially reduces CDI, achieving fairer and more equitable performance. This work establishes SCI as a measurable and correctable bias, providing a foundation for advancing semantic fairness and interpretable vision learning."}

In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations."}

Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks. Finally, we show that SimToolReal generalizes across a diverse set of everyday tools, achieving strong zero-shot performance over 120 real-world rollouts spanning 24 tasks, 12 object instances, and 6 tool categories."}

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work."}

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development."}

Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios."}

Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\n  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future."}

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows."}

Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases. Also, we demonstrate the potential of disjunction composition by applying the composition in an industrial case study."}

New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.\n  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired.

Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning.

We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality.

DRP, a contention-based data dissemination protocol, was developed for these applications. Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance.\n  To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays. ML-BSS algorithm predicts future link quality conditions and optimally adjusts the block size for rateless coding, reducing overhead and enhancing goodput.

We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features.

In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."}

Data transmission, latency, energy consumption, and dependence on large data centres create bottlenecks that scale poorly across heterogeneous, mobile, and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce Node Learning, a decen- tralised learning paradigm in which intelligence resides at individual edge nodes and expands through selective peer interaction. Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity. This concept paper develops the conceptual foundations of this paradigm, contrasts it with existing decentralised approaches, and examines implications for communi- cation, hardware, trust, and governance. Node Learning does not discard existing paradigms, but places them within a broader decentralised perspective"}

This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness."}

Its completion time is determined by the number of communication steps, which dominates latency-sensitive workloads, and the communication distance affecting both latency- and bandwidth-bound regimes. Direct-connect topologies, such as torus networks used in Google's TPUv4, are particularly prone to large communication distances due to limited bisection bandwidth. Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion. In contrast, recent approaches such as Swing reduce communication distance and congestion, but are inherently required to perform $\\log_2 n$ steps to complete AllReduce, sacrificing latency-optimality.\n  In this paper, we present Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that completes within $\\log_3 n$ steps, while reducing congestion compared to Bruck's algorithm by a factor of three and preserving bandwidth-optimality. Trivance exploits both transmission ports of a bidirectional ring within each step to triple the communication distance along both directions simultaneously. Furthermore, by performing joint reductions, Trivance improves both the number of steps and network congestion. We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages.\n  Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB. Throughout the evaluation, Trivance remains the best-performing latency-optimal algorithm."}

Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots."}

We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting."}

This paper proposes a unified framework, where each score is explicitly defined with respect to a given order. This order-oriented perspective enables more flexible and coherent scoring mechanisms. We examine several classical orders on hesitant fuzzy elements, that is, nonempty subsets in [0,1], and show that, contrary to prior claims, they do not induce lattice structures. In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the Gärdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds. Two concrete examples of dominance functions for finite sets are provided: the discrete dominance function and the relative dominance function. We show that these can be employed to construct fuzzy preference relations on typical hesitant fuzzy sets and support group decision-making."}

Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems."}

Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems."}

To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising.

Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant.

Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation."}

The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach.

Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP.

We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance.

In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation.

Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet.

We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings."}

This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."}

We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67).

A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm.

Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity.

These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy.

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance."}

Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger."}

We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control."}

While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input. VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens. This approach improves visual grounding and mitigates language bias, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced supervision by focusing exclusively on visually informative samples and tokens."}

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems."}

Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations."}

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance.

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."}

In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data."}

This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."}

We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error.

We present \\textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\\% in FDE, 12\\% in ADE, and a 4\\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet.

We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns.

A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics.

Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds."}

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets."}

The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort.

Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures. Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity."}

Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%).

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery."}

However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods.

This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets."}

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency.

To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."}

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines."}

Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average."}

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment.

These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\n  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents.

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry.

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters."}

While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions."}

Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination."}

We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations.

To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing."}

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence."}

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice.

Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices."}

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."}

Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page."}

Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model.

Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots."}

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."}

Combining multiple task vectors, however, can lead to cross-task interference, causing representation drift and degraded performance. Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning."}

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."}

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task."}

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements."}

Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios."}

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma."}

Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning.

The system was mathematically specified prior to implementation and realized as a CPU-resident graph engine operating under bounded local state evolution.\n  Contemporary inference-driven AI architectures reconstruct semantic state through probabilistic recomposition, producing compute cost that scales with token volume and context horizon. In contrast, the substrate described here represents semantic continuity as a persistent, addressable memory graph evolved under a time-modulated local operator g(t). Work is bounded by local semantic change Delta s, independent of total memory cardinality M.\n  Empirical measurements on Apple M2-class silicon demonstrate invariant traversal latency (approximately 0.25 to 0.32 ms), stable CPU utilization (approximately 17.2 percent baseline with Delta CPU approximately 0 to 0.2 percent), and no scale-correlated thermal signature across 1M to 25M node regimes under sustained operation. Measured per-node density ranges from approximately 1.3 KB (Float64 baseline) to approximately 687 bytes (compressed Float32 accounting). Under binary memory accounting, this yields a 1.6 billion node capacity projection within a 1 TiB envelope.\n  These results indicate an empirically invariant thermodynamic regime in which scaling is governed by memory capacity rather than inference-bound recomposition. The Compute ICE-AGE is defined as the Invariant Compute Envelope under Addressable Graph Evolution, and the empirical evidence presented demonstrates this regime up to 25M nodes."}

Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks.

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI."}

This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\\times$ and $3.2\\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence."}

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\n  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."}

In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations."}

Code available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD", "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD."}

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets."}
