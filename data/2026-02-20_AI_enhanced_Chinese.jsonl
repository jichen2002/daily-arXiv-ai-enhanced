On large highway and bridge projects, this delay limits early intervention and increases the risk of rework, schedule impacts, and fragmented documentation. This study presents a construction-phase digital twin framework designed to support element-level QA and readiness-based decision making during active construction. The framework links inspection records, material production and placement data, early-age sensing, and predictive strength models to individual construction elements. By integrating these data streams, the system represents the evolving quality state of each element and supports structured release or hold decisions before standard-age test results are available. The approach does not replace established inspection and testing procedures. Instead, it supplements existing workflows by improving traceability and enabling earlier, data-informed quality assessments. Practical considerations related to data integration, contractual constraints, and implementation challenges are also discussed. The proposed framework provides a structured pathway for transitioning construction QA from delayed, document-driven review toward proactive, element-level decision support during construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65bd\u5de5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u800c\u975e\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u516c\u8def\u548c\u6865\u6881\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u51e0\u5929\u6216\u51e0\u5468\u624d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd4\u5de5\u3001\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u6587\u6863\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u6750\u6599\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u653e\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2a\u65bd\u5de5\u5143\u7d20\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e74\u9f84\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e4b\u524d\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53d6\u4ee3\u65e2\u5b9a\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65bd\u5de5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e3b\u52a8\u65bd\u5de5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u5907\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u3001\u6587\u6863\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u3001\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Guided by these principles, we propose a training environment, Hybrid-Gym, consisting of a set of scalable synthetic tasks, such as function localization and dependency search. Experiments show that agents trained on our synthetic tasks effectively generalize to diverse real-world tasks that are not present in training, improving a base model by 25.4% absolute gain on SWE-Bench Verified, 7.9% on SWT-Bench Verified, and 5.1% on Commit-0 Lite.

We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained. Using repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling on a representative sample of 396 plugins, we identify six topics related to knowledge management and tooling, which is (i) dynamic editing and organization, (ii) interface and layouts, (iii) creative writing and productivity, (iv) knowledge sync solutions, (v) linking and script tools, and (vi) workflow enhancements tools. Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem.

Recently, Read-Modify-Writable (RMWable) snapshot was proposed, a variant of snapshot that allows processes to perform operations more complex than just read and write, specifically, each entry MEM[k] is an arbitrary readable object. The known RMWable snapshot algorithms heavily rely on powerful low-level operations such as compare&swap or load-link/store-conditional to correctly produce snapshots of MEM. Following the large body of research devoted to understand the limits of what can be solved using the simple read/write low-level operations, which are known to be strictly weaker than compare&swap and load-link/store-conditional, we explore if RMWable snapshots are possible using only read/write operations. We present two read/write RMWable snapshot algorithms, the first one in the standard concurrent shared-memory model where the number of processes n is finite and known in advance, and the second one in a variant of the standard model with unbounded concurrency, where there are infinitely many processes, but at any moment only finitely many processes participate in an execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0RMWable\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u6bd4compare&swap\u7b49\u5f31\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdb\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\u65e0\u9650\u4f46\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bfb/\u5199\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e76\u53d1\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u5e76\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RMWable\u5feb\u7167\u5728\u5f31\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing 3D generation methods are limited to handling a single control objective and lack the ability to utilize multiple images to independently control different regions of a 3D asset, which hinders their flexibility in applications. We propose Fuse3D, a novel method that enables generating 3D assets under the control of multiple images, allowing for the seamless fusion of multi-level regional controls from global views to intricate local details. First, we introduce a Multi-Condition Fusion Module to integrate the visual features from multiple image regions. Then, we propose a method to automatically align user-selected 2D image regions with their associated 3D regions based on semantic cues. Finally, to resolve control conflicts and enhance local control features from multi-condition images, we introduce a Local Attention Enhancement Strategy that flexibly balances region-specific feature fusion. Overall, we introduce the first method capable of controllable 3D asset generation from multiple condition images. The experimental results indicate that Fuse3D can flexibly fuse multiple 2D image regions into coherent 3D structures, resulting in high-quality 3D assets.

Existing RAN slicing frameworks predominantly rely on per-slice resource reservation, which ensures performance isolation but leads to inefficient utilization, particularly under bursty traffic. We introduce HyRA, a hybrid resource allocation framework for RAN slicing that combines dedicated per-slice allocations with shared resource pooling across slices. HyRA preserves performance isolation while improving resource efficiency by leveraging multiplexing gains in bursty traffic conditions. We formulate this design as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, where the outer loop determines the dedicated and shared resource budgets and the inner loop performs per-UE scheduling under a novel water-filling approach. By using the sample-average approximation, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the inner loop, and Big-M encoding, we transform the problem into a tractable mixed-integer program that standard optimization solvers can solve. Extensive simulations under diverse demand patterns, SLA configurations, and traffic burstiness show that HyRA achieves up to 50-75% spectrum savings compared to dedicated-only and shared-only baselines.

Compared to conventional photogrammetric 3D reconstruction techniques, modern approaches such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) excel in scene representation, rendering quality, and handling featureless regions. Among them, GS stands out for its efficiency, leveraging discrete anisotropic 3D Gaussians to represent radiance fields, unlike NeRF's continuous implicit model. This study introduces a GS-enabled digital twin method tailored for effective 3D damage visualization. The method's key contributions include: 1) utilizing GS-based 3D reconstruction to visualize 2D damage segmentation results while reducing segmentation errors; 2) developing a multi-scale reconstruction strategy to balance efficiency and damage detail; 3) enabling digital twin updates as damage evolves over time.

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\n  To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session.

To address these challenges, we propose Fed-PLoRA, a novel lightweight heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (FFT) framework. Fed-PLoRA introduces Parallel One-Rank Adaptation (PLoRA), a new LoRA variant that replaces the classic multi-rank LoRA module with multiple parallel one-rank modules, and a novel Select-N-Fold strategy that folds untrained PLoRA modules into the pre-trained weights before local training, thereby accommodating heterogeneous client resources. We provide a unified analysis of initialization and aggregation noise of Fed-PLoRA and demonstrate how it addresses the limitations of state-of-the-art methods.

The r-index and its derivatives combine the run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) with suffix array sampling to achieve space proportional to the number of equal-symbol runs in the BWT. While effective for near-identical strings, their size grows quickly as variation increases, since the number of BWT runs is sensitive to edits. Existing approaches typically trade space for query speed, or vice versa, limiting their practicality at large scale.\n  We introduce variable-length blocking (VLB), an encoding technique for BWT-based CSAs that adapts the amount of indexing information to local compressibility. The BWT is recursively divided into blocks of at most w runs (a parameter) and organized into a tree. Compressible regions appear near the root and store little auxiliary data, while incompressible regions lie deeper and retain additional information to speed up access. Queries traverse a short root-to-leaf path followed by a small run scan. This strategy balances space and query speed by transferring bits saved in compressible areas to accelerate access in incompressible ones.\n  Backward search relies on rank and successor queries over the BWT. We introduce a sampling technique that guarantees correctness only along valid backward-search states, reducing space without affecting query performance.\n  We extend VLB to encode the subsampled r-index (sr-index).

Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements.\n  We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications.

The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller.

Its completion time is determined by the number of communication steps, which dominates latency-sensitive workloads, and the communication distance affecting both latency- and bandwidth-bound regimes. Direct-connect topologies, such as torus networks used in Google's TPUv4, are particularly prone to large communication distances due to limited bisection bandwidth. Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion. In contrast, recent approaches such as Swing reduce communication distance and congestion, but are inherently required to perform $\\log_2 n$ steps to complete AllReduce, sacrificing latency-optimality.\n  In this paper, we present Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that completes within $\\log_3 n$ steps, while reducing congestion compared to Bruck's algorithm by a factor of three and preserving bandwidth-optimality. Trivance exploits both transmission ports of a bidirectional ring within each step to triple the communication distance along both directions simultaneously. Furthermore, by performing joint reductions, Trivance improves both the number of steps and network congestion. We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages.\n  Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB.

This work addresses uplink delay minimization in multi-RIS scenarios with heterogeneous per-user latency and reliability demands. We propose Delay-Aware RIS Orchestrator (DARIO), an O-RAN-compliant framework that dynamically assigns RIS devices to users within short time windows, adapting to traffic fluctuations to meet per-user delay and reliability targets. DARIO relies on a novel Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) model to analytically estimate the delay bound for each possible user-RIS assignment under specific traffic and service dynamics. These estimations are used by DARIO to formulate a Nonlinear Integer Program (NIP), for which an online heuristic provides near-optimal performance with low computational overhead.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion. Empirically, our method achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy while enabling up to 3x faster inference compared to autoregressive baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DODO\u5229\u7528\u5757\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u548c3\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3OCR\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5339\u914d\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "DODO\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "DODO\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb3\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DODO\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5757\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c3\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure.

But foundations differ in their policies, funding models, and support strategies. Moreover, since projects joining these foundations are diverse, coming at different lifecycle stages and having different needs, it can be challenging to decide on the appropriate project-foundation match and on the project-specific plan for sustainability.\n  Here, we present an empirical study and quantitative analysis of the sustainability of incubator projects in the Apache, Eclipse, and OSGeo foundations, and, additionally, of OSS projects from GitHub outside of foundations. We develop foundation-specific sustainability models and a project triage, based on projects' sociotechnical trace profiles, and demonstrate their effectiveness across the foundations. Our results show that our models with triage can effectively forecast sustainability outcomes not only within but across foundations.

This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge.

Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $\u03a9(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \\& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $\u03a9(\\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs.\n  In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = \u0398(\\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u6027\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u533f\u540d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4ec5\u9700$O(\\log \\log n)$\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8f6e\u6570\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u56fe\u4e0b\u9700\u8981$\u03a9(\\log n)$\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u6216\u4ec5\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff08\u5982\u73af\u3001\u6811\u6216\u6709\u754c\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u72b6\u6001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u533f\u540d\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570$N = \u0398(\\log n)$\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u540e\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9759\u9ed8\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u7ec8\u6b62\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528$O(\\log \\log n)$\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728$O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$\u8f6e\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7a33\u5b9a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u533f\u540d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u4ec5\u9700\u4f7f\u7528$O(\\log \\log n)$\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u5df2\u77e5\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570$N = \u0398(\\log n)$\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u5728$O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$\u8f6e\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage monocular foundation models with GRU-based iterative refinement for underwater adaptation; however, the sequential gating and local convolutional kernels in GRUs necessitate multiple iterations for long-range disparity propagation, limiting performance in large-disparity and textureless underwater regions. In this paper, we propose StereoAdapter-2, which replaces the conventional ConvGRU updater with a novel ConvSS2D operator based on selective state space models. The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

Accepted at MSR 2026", "summary": "Throughout the history of software, evolution has occurred in cycles of rise and fall driven by competition, and open-source software (OSS) is no exception. This cycle is accelerating, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as web development and deep learning. However, the impact of competitive relationships among OSS projects on their survival remains unclear, and there are risks of losing a competitive edge to rivals. To address this, this study proposes a new automated method called ``Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)'' to quantify these competitive relationships. The proposed method employs a structural vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions, normally used in macroeconomic analysis, to analyze the interactions among OSS projects. In an empirical analysis involving mining and analyzing 187 OSS project groups, MIAO identified projects that were forced to cease development owing to competitive influences with up to 81\\% accuracy, and the resulting features supported predictive experiments that anticipate cessation one year ahead with up to 77\\% accuracy. This suggests that MIAO could be a valuable tool for OSS project maintainers to understand the dynamics of OSS ecosystems and predict the rise and fall of OSS projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMIAO\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u7ec8\u6b62\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe81%\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u5176\u751f\u5b58\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u8d85\u8d8a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5206\u6790\uff09\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "MIAO\u5728\u5206\u6790187\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u7ec4\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u7ade\u4e89\u5f71\u54cd\u88ab\u8feb\u7ec8\u6b62\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe81%\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u524d\u4e00\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe77%\u3002", "conclusion": "MIAO\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe81%\uff0c\u4e3a\u9879\u76ee\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u9879\u76ee\u5174\u8870\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, traditional rigid job scheduling often results in underutilized resources and increased job waiting times.\n  This work evaluates the benefits of resource elasticity, where the job scheduler dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of malleable jobs at runtime. Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software.\n  We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs.\n  This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies.

Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms). The M2M latency contributes up to 60% of this value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u91cfCAVs\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2dM2M\u3001G2G\u548cE2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0M2M\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5360E2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u768460%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8G2G\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86M2M\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53E2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u3001\u5149\u7535\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u548c\u4e24\u4e2aGPS\u540c\u6b65\u7684Raspberry Pi 5\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7aef\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u7aef\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5546\u75284G\u548c5G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\uff0cE2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e73\u5747\u7ea6\u4e3a500\u6beb\u79d2\uff08\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6+/-4\u6beb\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dM2M\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5360\u6bd4\u9ad8\u8fbe60%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316M2M\u3001G2G\u548cE2E\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5cCAVs\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing datasets exhibit Semantic Coverage Imbalance (SCI), a previously overlooked bias arising from the long-tailed semantic representations. Unlike class imbalance, SCI occurs at the semantic level, affecting how models learn and reason about rare yet meaningful semantics. To mitigate SCI, we propose Semantic Coverage-Aware Network (SemCovNet), a novel model that explicitly learns to correct semantic coverage disparities. SemCovNet integrates a Semantic Descriptor Map (SDM) for learning semantic representations, a Descriptor Attention Modulation (DAM) module that dynamically weights visual and concept features, and a Descriptor-Visual Alignment (DVA) loss that aligns visual features with descriptor semantics.

To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age.

The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors.

Karen Liu"], "title": "SimToolReal: An Object-Centric Policy for Zero-Shot Dexterous Tool Manipulation", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability to manipulate tools significantly expands the set of tasks a robot can perform. Yet, tool manipulation represents a challenging class of dexterity, requiring grasping thin objects, in-hand object rotations, and forceful interactions. Since collecting teleoperation data for these behaviors is challenging, sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising alternative. However, prior approaches typically require substantial engineering effort to model objects and tune reward functions for each task. In this work, we propose SimToolReal, taking a step towards generalizing sim-to-real RL policies for tool manipulation. Instead of focusing on a single object and task, we procedurally generate a large variety of tool-like object primitives in simulation and train a single RL policy with the universal goal of manipulating each object to random goal poses. This approach enables SimToolReal to perform general dexterous tool manipulation at test-time without any object or task-specific training. We demonstrate that SimToolReal outperforms prior retargeting and fixed-grasp methods by 37% while matching the performance of specialist RL policies trained on specific target objects and tasks.

Many proposed code evolution pipelines show impressive performance but are often not compared to simpler baselines. We test how well two simple baselines do over three domains: finding better mathematical bounds, designing agentic scaffolds, and machine learning competitions. We find that simple baselines match or exceed much more sophisticated methods in all three. By analyzing these results we find various shortcomings in how code evolution is both developed and used. For the mathematical bounds, a problem's search space and domain knowledge in the prompt are chiefly what dictate a search's performance ceiling and efficiency, with the code evolution pipeline being secondary. Thus, the primary challenge in finding improved bounds is designing good search spaces, which is done by domain experts, and not the search itself. When designing agentic scaffolds we find that high variance in the scaffolds coupled with small datasets leads to suboptimal scaffolds being selected, resulting in hand-designed majority vote scaffolds performing best. We propose better evaluation methods that reduce evaluation stochasticity while keeping the code evolution economically feasible. We finish with a discussion of avenues and best practices to enable more rigorous code evolution in future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0e\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u754c\u9650\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7406\u652f\u67b6\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ade\u8d5b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTML First\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u8c03HTML\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u4ee3\u7801\u7cbe\u7b80\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u76ca\u5904\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u4e0eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u4ecd\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8HTML\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f51\u9875\u6846\u67b6\u76db\u884c\u540e\uff0cHTML First\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5e26\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7htmx\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u548cYle\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HTML First\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "HTML First\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u56e0\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5316\u800c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0a\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "HTML First \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7cbe\u7b80\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u76ca\u5904\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u8d8b\u52bf\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ and ZFP provide strong numerical error guarantees, they often fail to preserve topological structures (example, minima, maxima, and saddle points) that are critical for scientific analysis. Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoSZp \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21 HPC \u6a21\u62df\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u7684\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08\u5982 SZ \u548c ZFP\uff09\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6570\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u548c\u978d\u70b9\uff09\u3002", "method": "TopoSZp \u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684 SZp \u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u987a\u5e8f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u978d\u70b9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u5747\u5728\u5bbd\u677e\u4f46\u4e25\u683c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTopoSZp \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5c11 3 \u5230 100 \u500d\u7684\u975e\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u5047\u9633\u6027\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u89e3\u538b\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u5feb 100 \u5230 10000 \u500d\u548c 10 \u5230 500 \u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoSZp \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u89e3\u538b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.\n  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACOS\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u57fa\u6570OCS\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684ML\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5305\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570OCS\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u6162\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u57fa\u6570OCS\u6784\u5efaACOS\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6545\u969c\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "ACOS\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u914d\u7f6e\u5305\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "ACOS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u57fa\u6570OCS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5757\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4e13\u7528ML\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u914d\u7f6e\u5305\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

HSI captures detailed biochemical features of produce, while 3D geometric data substantially improves morphological analysis. However, integrating these two modalities at scale remains challenging, as conventional approaches involve complex hardware setups incompatible with automated phenotyping systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRF) offer computationally efficient 3D reconstruction but typically require moving-camera setups, limiting throughput and reproducibility in standard indoor agricultural environments. To address these challenges, we introduce HSI-SC-NeRF, a stationary-camera multi-channel NeRF framework for high-throughput hyperspectral 3D reconstruction targeting postharvest inspection of agricultural produce. Multi-view hyperspectral data is captured using a stationary camera while the object rotates within a custom-built Teflon imaging chamber providing diffuse, uniform illumination. Object poses are estimated via ArUco calibration markers and transformed to the camera frame of reference through simulated pose transformations, enabling standard NeRF training on stationary-camera data. A multi-channel NeRF formulation optimizes reconstruction across all hyperspectral bands jointly using a composite spectral loss, supported by a two-stage training protocol that decouples geometric initialization from radiometric refinement. Experiments on three agricultural produce samples demonstrate high spatial reconstruction accuracy and strong spectral fidelity across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, confirming the suitability of HSI-SC-NeRF for integration into automated agricultural workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "HSI-SC-NeRF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9759\u6b62\u76f8\u673a\u591a\u901a\u9053NeRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u519c\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u9ad8\u5149\u8c313D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6b62\u76f8\u673a\u548c\u591a\u901a\u9053NeRF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ArUco\u6821\u51c6\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u519c\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u5149\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HSI-SC-NeRF \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u9ad8\u5149\u8c313D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u5149\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Let $S(n)$ be the minimum number of hyperplanes needed to slice $Q_n$. We prove that $S(n) \\leq \\lceil \\frac{4n}{5} \\rceil$, except when $n$ is an odd multiple of $5$, in which case $S(n) \\leq \\frac{4n}{5} +1$.

Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved.

Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads.\n  This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community.\n  DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86DAOS\u548cCeph\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728NWP\u548cHPC/AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DAOS\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eCeph\u548cLustre\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u672a\u6765HPC\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8HPC\u548cAI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982NWP\uff09\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfPOSIX\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21I/O\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u5b58\u50a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u4f7fECMWF\u7684NWP\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528DAOS\u548cCeph\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684I/O\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f8\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684Lustre\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "DAOS\u548cCeph\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46DAOS\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCeph\u548cLustre\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21I/O\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "DAOS\u548cCeph\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46DAOS\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eCeph\u548cLustre\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21I/O\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9884\u793a\u7740\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u50a8\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fDAOS\uff09\u5728\u672a\u6765HPC\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.We present MALLVi, a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step.Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.", "AI": {"tldr": "MALLVi\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5f00\u653e\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "MALLVi\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff08Decomposer\u3001Localizer\u3001Thinker\u3001Reflector\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u7684Descriptor\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMALLVi\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MALLVi\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality.

NeuDiff Agent executes this established pipeline under explicit governance by restricting actions to allowlisted tools, enforcing fail-closed verification gates at key workflow boundaries, and capturing complete provenance for inspection, auditing, and controlled replay.

These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells.

DRP, a contention-based data dissemination protocol, was developed for these applications. Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance.\n  To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays.

Unlike recent endeavors that focus on directly learning the task in the action domain, we focus on inferring what the robot should achieve in the task, rather than how to do so. To this end, we represent evolving scene states using a series of graphical object relationships. We propose a demonstration segmentation and pooling approach that extracts a series of manipulation graphs and estimates distributions over object states across task phases. In contrast to prior graph-based methods that capture only partial interactions or short temporal windows, our approach captures complete object interactions spanning from the onset of control to the end of the manipulation. To improve robustness when learning from multiple demonstrations, we additionally perform object matching using pre-trained visual features. In extensive experiments, we evaluate our method's demonstration segmentation accuracy and the utility of learning from multiple demonstrations for finding a desired minimal task model.

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions.

Nodes learn continuously from local data, maintain their own model state, and exchange learned knowledge opportunistically when collaboration is beneficial. Learning propagates through overlap and diffusion rather than global synchro- nisation or central aggregation. It unifies autonomous and cooperative behaviour within a single abstraction and accommodates heterogeneity in data, hardware, objectives, and connectivity.

This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution.

Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects.

Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%).

In contrast, we prove that the scores defined with respect to the symmetric order satisfy key normative criteria for scoring functions, including strong monotonicity with respect to unions and the G\u00e4rdenfors condition.\n  Following this analysis, we introduce a class of functions, called dominance functions, for ranking hesitant fuzzy elements. They aim to compare hesitant fuzzy elements relative to control sets incorporating minimum acceptability thresholds.

Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u4f26\u7406\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u597d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4f26\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u4ef7\u503c\u51b2\u7a81\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6/\u591a\u65b9/\u591a\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8c08\u5224\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f26\u7406\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u4f26\u7406\u504f\u597d\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8c08\u5224\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4f26\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects.

We present PartRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that integrates an external part database with a diffusion transformer to couple generation with an editable representation. To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s.

However, they are often developed from scratch despite functional overlaps, and abandoned after publication. This lack of interoperability and maintenance incurs unnecessary development effort, impedes tool comparison and benchmarking, complicates documentation, and diminishes the long-term sustainability of NLP4RE tools. To address these issues, we postulate a vision to transition from monolithic NLP4RE tools to an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable modules. We outline a research roadmap towards a software reference architecture (SRA) to realize this vision, elaborated following a standard methodological framework for SRA development.

To address these challenges, we propose an efficient compression framework that transforms the 60-layer dual-stream MMDiT-based Qwen-Image into lightweight models without training from scratch. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant.

Safety evaluations, however, overwhelmingly measure text-level refusal behavior, leaving a critical question unanswered: does alignment that suppresses harmful text also suppress harmful actions? We introduce the GAP benchmark, a systematic evaluation framework that measures divergence between text-level safety and tool-call-level safety in LLM agents. We test six frontier models across six regulated domains (pharmaceutical, financial, educational, employment, legal, and infrastructure), seven jailbreak scenarios per domain, three system prompt conditions (neutral, safety-reinforced, and tool-encouraging), and two prompt variants, producing 17,420 analysis-ready datapoints. Our central finding is that text safety does not transfer to tool-call safety. Across all six models, we observe instances where the model's text output refuses a harmful request while its tool calls simultaneously execute the forbidden action--a divergence we formalize as the GAP metric. Even under safety-reinforced system prompts, 219 such cases persist across all six models. System prompt wording exerts substantial influence on tool-call behavior: TC-safe rates span 21 percentage points for the most robust model and 57 for the most prompt-sensitive, with 16 of 18 pairwise ablation comparisons remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. Runtime governance contracts reduce information leakage in all six models but produce no detectable deterrent effect on forbidden tool-call attempts themselves. These results demonstrate that text-only safety evaluations are insufficient for assessing agent behavior and that tool-call safety requires dedicated measurement and mitigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5bb3\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GAP\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u516d\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u3001\u4e03\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4e09\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f17,420\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u5c31\u7eea\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u6587\u672c\u62d2\u7edd\u4f46\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6267\u884c\u6709\u5bb3\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u63aa\u8f9e\u5bf9\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach.

This makes ports particularly detrimental to geometry-based downstream pipelines such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and visual SLAM, where dynamic or non-anatomical outliers degrade alignment and tracking stability. Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening.

Currently, AgentLAB supports five novel attack types including intent hijacking, tool chaining, task injection, objective drifting, and memory poisoning, spanning 28 realistic agentic environments, and 644 security test cases. Leveraging AgentLAB, we evaluate representative LLM agents and find that they remain highly susceptible to long-horizon attacks; moreover, defenses designed for single-turn interactions fail to reliably mitigate long-horizon threats.

This repeated exposure to observing the same areas poses significant challenges for mapping and localization -- key components for enabling any higher-level task. In this work, we propose a novel multi-session framework that builds on map-based localization, in contrast to the common practice of greedily running full SLAM sessions and trying to find correspondences between the resulting maps.

We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering.

In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet.

We demonstrate that fine-tuning aligned vision-language models on narrow-domain harmful datasets induces severe emergent misalignment that generalizes broadly across unrelated tasks and modalities. Through experiments on Gemma3-4B, we show that misalignment scales monotonically with LoRA rank, and that multimodal evaluation reveals substantially higher misalignment ($70.71 \\pm 1.22$ at $r=128$) than text-only evaluation ($41.19 \\pm 2.51$), suggesting that unimodal safety benchmarks may underestimate alignment degradation in vision-language models. Critically, even 10\\% harmful data in the training mixture induces substantial alignment degradation. Geometric analysis reveals that harmful behaviors occupy a remarkably low-dimensional subspace, with the majority of misalignment information captured in 10 principal components. To mitigate misalignment, we evaluate two strategies: benign narrow fine-tuning and activation-based steering. While both approaches substantially reduce misalignment, neither completely removes the learned harmful behaviors. Our findings highlight the need for robust continual learning frameworks, as current post-training paradigms may not sufficiently preserve alignment in post-deployment settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec8\u8eab\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30LoRA\u79e9\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u6240\u5728\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u826f\u6027\u7a84\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\\sim$200\\,m horizontal loop and a $\\sim$15\\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\\,m and 0.219\\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\\,m and 0.199\\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\\sim$700\\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\\,m error and a $\\sim$20\\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\\,m error.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c04\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u62103D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u56fe\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u5149\u7167\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408RF\u4f20\u611f\u4e0eGS\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5982\u6c7d\u8f66\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u4e0eGS\u6e32\u67d3\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5e76\u751f\u62103D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316GS\u6e32\u67d3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06RF\u4f20\u611f\u5f15\u5165GS\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002RF\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff08GS\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u7684RF\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aGS\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

This lack of temporal awareness facilitates a \"Safety Gap\" where adversarial tactics, like Crescendo and ActorAttack, slowly bleed malicious intent across turn boundaries to bypass stateless filters. We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications.

In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm.

We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy.

Optical soft sensors are attractive for monolithic printing, but their performance is often degraded by uncontrolled light propagation (ambient coupling, leakage, scattering), while common miti- gation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces. Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles.

Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy.

Existing approaches, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic lenses and sprays, provide only partial mitigation, while industrial protection systems imply high cost and they do not enable scalability for automotive deployment.\n  To address these limitations, this paper presents a cost-effective hardware solution for rainy conditions, designed to be compatible with multiple cameras simultaneously.\n  Beyond its technical contribution, the proposed solution supports sustainability goals in transportation systems. By enabling compatibility with existing camera-based sensing platforms, the system extends the operational reliability of automated vehicles without requiring additional high-cost sensors or hardware replacements. This approach reduces resource consumption, supports modular upgrades, and promotes more cost-efficient deployment of automated vehicle technologies, particularly in challenging weather conditions where system failures would otherwise lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions.

However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices.

Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol.

While prior work attempts to mitigate this issue through decoding strategies, architectural modifications, or curated instruction data, they typically lack a quantitative measure of how much individual training samples or tokens actually benefit from the image. In this work, we introduce Visual Information Gain (VIG), a perplexity-based metric that measures the reduction in prediction uncertainty provided by visual input.

Most existing attacks rely on manually crafted, semantics-driven prompt manipulation, which often yields low attack success rates and limited transferability to closed-source commercial models. In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency. Moreover, we identified over 70 vulnerabilities in real-world commercial products that have been confirmed by vendors, underscoring the practical severity of structured template-based hijacking and providing an empirical foundation for securing next-generation agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Phantom\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u52ab\u6301\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u6ce8\u5165\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u95ed\u6e90\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0cPhantom\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Phantom\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08TAE\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u653b\u51fb\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen\u3001GPT\u548cGemini\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPhantom\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Phantom\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u6ce8\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5546\u4e1a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8670\u591a\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5047\u80a2\u819d\u5173\u8282\u7684\u819d\u4e0a\u653e\u7f6e\u6bd4\u819d\u4e0b\u653e\u7f6e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6b65\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6b65\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u80a2\u622a\u80a2\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u7403\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u635f\u3001\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e5\u5e38\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5047\u80a2\u819d\u5173\u8282\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u8f85\u52a9\u819d\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u6765\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6b65\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u5750\u7ad9\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u8fd9\u4e9b\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u5bf9\u6b65\u6001\u529b\u5b66\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4ee3\u8c22\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5047\u80a2\u819d\u5173\u8282\u819d\u4e0a\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u819d\u4e0b\u653e\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u62ec\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6b65\u9891\u3001\u6b65\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u819d\u5173\u8282\u6d3b\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u659c\u5761\u548c\u697c\u68af\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u819d\u4e0b\u653e\u7f6e\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u819d\u4e0a\u914d\u7f6e\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6539\u5584\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u4e00\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u9ad89.2%\uff09\u548c\u6b65\u9891\uff08\u63d0\u9ad83.6%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6b65\u6001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u819d\u5173\u8282\u6d3b\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u901f\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u5728\u659c\u5761\u548c\u697c\u68af\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u819d\u4e0a\u653e\u7f6e\u52a8\u529b\u5047\u80a2\u819d\u5173\u8282\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u52a8\u529b\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u989d\u5916\u91cd\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u786e\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5efa\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records.", "AI": {"tldr": "HQFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u9aa4\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002HQFS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "HQFS\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08VQC\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u98ce\u9669-\u56de\u62a5\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aQUBO\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u6216\u7ecf\u5178QUBO\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6b21\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u7b7e\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHQFS\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u5916\u590f\u666e\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u56de\u64a4\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "HQFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u98ce\u9669\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u6027\u3002"}}

Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "RA-Nav\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u7a81\u53d1\u969c\u788d\u7269\u79fb\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u9759\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7a81\u7136\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRA-Nav\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u9759\u6b62\u3001\u6682\u65f6\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u5f84\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0cRA-Nav\u5728\u7a81\u53d1\u969c\u788d\u7269\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RA-Nav\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u7a81\u53d1\u969c\u788d\u7269\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Code will be available at https://github.com/L-YeZhu/GASS_T2I", "summary": "Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "GASS\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling\uff08GASS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6e90\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u5728CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u5206\u89e3\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u65b9\u5411\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u5411\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u51e0\u4f55\u6295\u5f71\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08U-Net\u548cDiT\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGASS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7403\u5f62\u91c7\u6837\uff08GASS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error.

When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \\textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\\% in FDE, 12\\% in ADE, and a 4\\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise.

In particular, we focused on AlphaEarth Embeddings at 10 m spatial resolution and evaluated their capability to support terrain height inference using a high-quality Digital Surface Model (DSM) as reference. U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns.

To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques.

Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking.

However, creating fair matches between lobbies (pre-made teams) of heterogeneous skill levels presents a significant challenge. Matching based simply on average team skill metrics, such as mean or median rating or rank, often results in unbalanced and one-sided games, particularly when skill distributions are wide or skewed. This paper introduces Cinder, a two-stage matchmaking system designed to provide fast and fair matches. Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cinder\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Ruzicka\u6307\u6570\u548cKantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u73a9\u5bb6\u7559\u5b58\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u5339\u914d\u5e38\u56e0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002", "method": "Cinder\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u9009\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u6280\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6280\u80fd\u6876\u6620\u5c04\u548cKantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u2018\u5236\u88c1\u5206\u6570\u2019\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5339\u914d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf91.4\u4ebf\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u56e2\u961f\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0cCinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u9608\u503c\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "Cinder\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Ruzicka\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u548cKantorovich\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u6280\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u56e2\u961f\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook.

Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "EA-Swin \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7684 Swin Transformer \u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6d45\u5c42\u5d4c\u5165\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684 MLLM\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "EA-Swin \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7684 Swin Transformer\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 EA-Video \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b 130K \u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "EA-Swin \u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 0.97-0.99 \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a 0.8-0.9\uff09\u9ad8\u51fa 5-20%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EA-Swin \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5d4c\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u7684 Swin Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3 AI \u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline).

By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%.

However, existing deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods often treat satellite image sequences as generic videos, neglecting the underlying atmospheric physical laws governing cloud motion. To address this, we propose a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN) for TC image super-resolution. Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures.

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes attachment anchors to improve grasping point prediction in colorectal surgery, showing better results than image-only methods, especially in unfamiliar scenarios.", "motivation": "Colorectal surgeries are complex and underrepresented in current research, yet they offer a promising learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them ideal for autonomous, machine learning-driven support.", "method": "The paper introduces attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments.

However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise.

To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones.

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Polaffini\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u5c04\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Polaffini\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u5206\u5272\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8d28\u5fc3\u83b7\u5f97\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4eff\u5c04\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u4eff\u5c04\u5230\u591a\u4eff\u5c04\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "Polaffini\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5ea6\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u914d\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Polaffini\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $\u03c0_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAG \u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316 VLAs \u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 VLAs \u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5373\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u610f\u56fe\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CAG \u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6 VLA \u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u7684 Vision-Action (VA) \u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "CAG \u5728 LIBERO-CF \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u9075\u5faa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff089.7%\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff083.6%\uff09\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11 9.4% \u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5931\u8d25\u5e76\u63d0\u5347 17.2% \u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8c03\u8282\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%.

Code available at https://github.com/miccunifi/SpectralGCD", "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary.

Our predictor achieves 0.44 correlation with actual loss using only four simple features: token frequency, sequence length, vocabulary diversity, and rare token ratio. Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can potentially generate fine-grained, language-based analyses, yet existing methods often require costly fine-tuning and do not consistently improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to lightweight specialist detectors. We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications.\n  Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions.\n  Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406AI\u57286G\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7AgenCom\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u94fe\u8def\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77406G\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u7406AI\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8de8\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94fe\u8def\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406AgenCom\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406AI\u76846G\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u94fe\u8def\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee3\u7406AgenCom\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry.

However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined.

While self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced ICD systems, existing view-level contrastive methods struggle with sophisticated edits due to insufficient fine-grained correspondence learning.

First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training.

While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models.

Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings.

Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces.

We propose \\texttt{\\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \\textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform.

Across \\textbf{three} medical VLMs and \\textbf{nine} downstream tasks, \\texttt{\\textbf{LATA}} consistently reduces set size and CCV while matching or tightening target coverage, outperforming prior transductive baselines and narrowing the gap to label-using methods, while using far less compute.

However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations.

A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "RetouchIQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u521b\u610f\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RetouchIQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "RetouchIQ\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684MLLM\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "RetouchIQ\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684MLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u3002"}}

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence.

These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation.

Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology.\n  This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A).\n  This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided.

Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data.

By analyzing high-dimensional activation vectors from different LLMs, we probe whether different cognitive levels, ranging from basic recall (Remember) to abstract synthesis (Create), are linearly separable within the model's residual streams. Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\uff0cBloom\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u5982\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u521b\u9020\uff09\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8ba4\u77e5\u96be\u5ea6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u65e9\u671f\u5373\u88ab\u89e3\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u9762\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u63a2\u7a76Bloom\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5404\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5230\u62bd\u8c61\u5408\u6210\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709Bloom\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea695%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301Bloom\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5404\u5c42\u6b21\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002"}}

The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \\textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \\textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \\textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \\textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces.

In this work, we present a detailed case study of training a 1.36B-parameter scientific language model directly from raw arXiv LaTeX sources spanning mathematics, computer science, and theoretical physics. We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "MedClarify\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u540e\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66LLMs\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u533b\u5b66LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u540e\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "MedClarify\u8ba1\u7b97\u5019\u9009\u8bca\u65ad\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "MedClarify\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u6b21LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea627\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "MedClarify\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfb\u6c42\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66LLMs\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea627\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content.

This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models.

However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u56fd\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u513f\u7ae5AI\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u513f\u7ae5\u4f7f\u7528AI\u6280\u672f\u65f6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08PbD\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86GDPR\u3001PIPEDA\u3001COPPA\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u5230LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728LLM\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u9f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e3a\u513f\u7ae5\u8bbe\u8ba1AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5408\u89c4\u3002"}}

It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem.

Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models.

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability.

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1.

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering.

Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAI GameStore\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u4e14\u6613\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u7c7b\u4eba\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AI GameStore\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4eba\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u6e38\u620f\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684100\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u4e0d\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u768410%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faAI GameStore\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u5411\u7c7b\u4eba\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u5efa\u8bbe\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods.

Empirical systems study of a deterministic semantic substrate evaluated up to 25M nodes on Apple M2-class silicon. Includes density accounting, thermodynamic analysis, and scaling argument", "summary": "This paper presents empirical results from a production-grade C++ implementation of a deterministic semantic state substrate derived from prior formal work on Bounded Local Generator Classes (Martin, 2026). The system was mathematically specified prior to implementation and realized as a CPU-resident graph engine operating under bounded local state evolution.\n  Contemporary inference-driven AI architectures reconstruct semantic state through probabilistic recomposition, producing compute cost that scales with token volume and context horizon. In contrast, the substrate described here represents semantic continuity as a persistent, addressable memory graph evolved under a time-modulated local operator g(t). Work is bounded by local semantic change Delta s, independent of total memory cardinality M.\n  Empirical measurements on Apple M2-class silicon demonstrate invariant traversal latency (approximately 0.25 to 0.32 ms), stable CPU utilization (approximately 17.2 percent baseline with Delta CPU approximately 0 to 0.2 percent), and no scale-correlated thermal signature across 1M to 25M node regimes under sustained operation. Measured per-node density ranges from approximately 1.3 KB (Float64 baseline) to approximately 687 bytes (compressed Float32 accounting). Under binary memory accounting, this yields a 1.6 billion node capacity projection within a 1 TiB envelope.\n  These results indicate an empirically invariant thermodynamic regime in which scaling is governed by memory capacity rather than inference-bound recomposition. The Compute ICE-AGE is defined as the Invariant Compute Envelope under Addressable Graph Evolution, and the empirical evidence presented demonstrates this regime up to 25M nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u57fa\u5e95\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u572825M\u8282\u70b9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u53d8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5305\u7edc\uff08Compute ICE-AGE\uff09\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u53d7\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u91cd\u7ec4\u8bed\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6807\u8bb0\u91cf\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8303\u56f4\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u53ef\u5bfb\u5740\u5185\u5b58\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50g(t)\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316Delta s\uff0c\u4e0e\u603b\u5185\u5b58\u57fa\u6570M\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7C++\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eBounded Local Generator Classes\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCPU\u9a7b\u7559\u7684\u56fe\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c40\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Apple M2\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u904d\u5386\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08\u7ea60.25\u81f30.32\u6beb\u79d2\uff09\uff0cCPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\uff08\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ea617.2%\uff0cDelta CPU\u7ea60\u81f30.2%\uff09\uff0c\u57281M\u81f325M\u8282\u70b9\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u65e0\u89c4\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\u70ed\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8282\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ece\u7ea61.3 KB\uff08Float64\u57fa\u7ebf\uff09\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u7ea6687\u5b57\u8282\uff08Float32\u538b\u7f29\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u6838\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u57281 TiB\u5185\u652f\u630116\u4ebf\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86Compute ICE-AGE\uff08\u53ef\u5bfb\u5740\u56fe\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5305\u7edc\uff09\u3002"}}
