This divergence is not an implementation bug; it is a Category Mistake -- the same one that pervades distributed computing wherever Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions are embedded into protocol design. Parker et al. showed in 1983 that network partitioning destroys mutual consistency; iCloud adds a user interface that conceals this impossibility behind a facade of seamlessness. This document presents a unified analysis of why iCloud fails when composed with Time Machine, git, automated toolchains, and general-purpose developer workflows, supported by direct evidence including documented corruption events and a case study involving 366 GB of divergent state accumulated through normal use. We show that the failures arise from five interlocking incompatibilities rooted in a single structural error: the projection of a distributed causal graph onto a linear temporal chain. We then show how the same Category Mistake, when it occurs in network fabrics as link flapping, destroys topology knowledge through epistemic collapse. Finally, we argue that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) transactional semantics -- bilateral, reversible, and conservation-preserving -- provide the structural foundation for resolving these failures, not by defeating physics, but by aligning protocol behavior with physical reality."}

It also requires spectral textures and lights throughout the rendering pipeline. We propose Hadamard spectral codes, a compact latent representation that enables spectral rendering using standard RGB rendering operations. Spectral images are approximated with a small number of RGB rendering passes, followed by a decoding step. Our key requirement is latent linearity: scaling and addition in spectral space correspond to scaling and addition of codes, and the element-wise product of spectra (for example reflectance times illumination) is approximated by the element-wise product of their latent codes. We show that an exact low-dimensional algebra-preserving representation cannot exist for arbitrary spectra when the latent dimension k is smaller than the number of spectral samples n. We therefore introduce a learned non-negative linear encoder and decoder architecture that preserves scaling and addition exactly while encouraging approximate multiplicativity under the Hadamard product. With k = 6, we render k/3 = 2 RGB images per frame using an unmodified RGB renderer, reconstruct the latent image, and decode to high-resolution spectra or XYZ or RGB. Experiments on 3D scenes demonstrate that k = 6 significantly reduces color error compared to RGB baselines while being substantially faster than naive n-sample spectral rendering. Using k = 9 provides higher-quality reference results. We further introduce a lightweight neural upsampling network that maps RGB assets directly to latent codes, enabling integration of legacy RGB content into the spectral pipeline while maintaining perceptually accurate colors in rendered images."}

The programme assumes that a unified time standard can be constructed by deploying atomic clocks on the lunar surface, computing relativistic corrections, and distributing synchronized time via LunaNet. This paper argues that the entire enterprise rests on a category mistake in the sense introduced by Ryle and developed by Spekkens in quantum foundations: it treats \"synchronized time\" as an ontic entity -- something that exists independently and can be transmitted from authoritative sources to dependent receivers -- when it is in fact an epistemic construct: a model-dependent representation of observer-relative clock relationships. We analyze the cislunar time programme through the lens of Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) assumptions, Spekkens' Leibnizian operationalism, the Wood-Spekkens fine-tuning argument, and the distinction between ontic and epistemic interpretations that has dissolved long-standing puzzles in quantum mechanics. We show that the same conceptual move that dissolves quantum \"mysteries\" -- recognizing what is epistemic versus what is ontic -- dissolves the apparent coherence of the cislunar time programme and reveals it as an engineering project built on a philosophical confusion. We sketch a transactional alternative grounded in bilateral atomic interactions rather than unidirectional time distribution."}

In task-oriented V2X networks, vehicles select the content of the transmitted messages based on its relevance to the intended receivers. However, relevance estimation can be quite challenging, especially in highly dynamic and complex vehicular scenarios. Relevance estimation errors can cause a vehicle to omit relevant information from its transmitted message, leading to a content-selection error. Content-selection errors reduce the amount of relevant information available at the receivers and can potentially impair their situational awareness. This work analyses the impact of content-selection errors on task-oriented V2X networks. Our analysis reveals that task-oriented V2X networks feature an inherent resilience to content-selection errors that guarantees a consistent delivery of relevant information even under high relevance estimation error conditions. Moreover, we identify the fundamental conditions underpinning such inherent resilience. These conditions can be encountered in other task-oriented networks where multiple transmitters select the content of their messages based on the task-related requirements of a common set of intended receivers."}

We present a translation and validation framework for translating Go projects with external dependencies to Rust. Our approach combines (i) a retrieval mechanism that maps Go library APIs to Rust APIs, and (ii) a cross-language validation pipeline that establishes language interoperability in the presence of opaque library types by synthesising adapters exclusively from public library APIs, prior to validating I/O equivalence. We evaluate our system on six real-world Go repositories with non-trivial external dependencies. Our approach significantly increases both the compilation and equivalence success rate (up to 100% in the most dependency-heavy case; approx. 2x on average) by enabling validated translation that manipulate opaque, library-defined types."}

In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable."}

Each correction offers information on what the robot should and should not do, where the corrected behavior is more aligned with task objectives than the original behavior. Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives. Our results indicate that correction timing results in improved learning for the first two of these applications. Overall, our work provides new insights on the value of correction timing as a signal for robot learning."}

The player then selects a single cup from which to remove 1 unit of water. In the bamboo trimming problem, the adversary must choose fixed rates for the cups, and the player is additionally allowed to empty the chosen cup entirely. Past work has shown that the optimal backlog in these two settings is $Θ(\\log n)$ and 2 respectively.\n  The greedy algorithm has been shown in previous work to be exactly optimal in the general cup game and asymptotically optimal in the bamboo setting. The greedy algorithm has been conjectured [16] to achieve the exactly optimal backlog of 2 in the bamboo setting as well. In this paper, we prove a lower bound of $2.076$ for the backlog of the greedy algorithm, disproving the conjecture of [16]. We also introduce a new algorithm, a hybrid greedy/Deadline-Driven, which achieves backlog $O(\\log n)$ in the general cup game, and remains exactly optimal for the bamboo trimming problem and the fixed-rate cup game -- this constitutes the first algorithm that achieves asymptotically optimal performance across all three settings.\n  Additionally, we introduce a new model, the semi-oblivious cup game, in which the player is uncertain of the exact heights of each cup. We analyze the performance of the greedy algorithm in this setting, which can be viewed as selecting an arbitrary cup within a constant multiplicative factor of the fullest cup. We prove matching upper and lower bounds showing that the greedy algorithm achieves a backlog of $Θ(n^{\\frac{c-1}{c}})$ in the semi-oblivious cup game. We also establish matching upper and lower bounds of $2^{Θ(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ in the semi-oblivious cup flushing game.

They are consequences of a category mistake: treating Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) information flow as a law of nature rather than recognizing it as a design choice inherited from Shannon's channel model and Lamport's happened-before relation. We develop this argument in six steps. First, we introduce the category mistake framework from Ryle through Spekkens' ontic/epistemic distinction in quantum foundations. Second, we identify FITO as the hidden axiom that unifies the classical impossibility results. Third, we apply Spekkens' Leibnizian principle to show that FITO-based models contain surplus ontological structure. Fourth, we develop the counterfactual: what changes when FITO is dropped. Fifth, we demonstrate that the impossibility theorems are theorems about FITO systems, not about physics. Sixth, we sketch the transactional alternative -- bilateral interactions that dissolve the apparent impossibilities by replacing unidirectional message passing with atomic bilateral transactions. The implication is that distributed computing has spent fifty years optimizing within the wrong design space."}

For a mobile device, this may include its mobility profile, recent location(s), and experienced channel conditions. Online schedulers, however, typically use this type of information to perform tasks such as shared bandwidth and channel time slot assignments. In this paper, we consider three transmission scheduling problems with energy constraints, where such information is needed, and yet must remain private: minimizing total transmission time when (i) fixed-power or (ii) fixed-rate time slotting with power control is used, and (iii) maximizing the amount of data uploaded in a fixed time period. Using a real-time federated optimization framework, we show how the scheduler can iteratively interact only with the DTs to produce global fractional solutions to these problems, without the latter revealing their private information. Then dependent rounding is used to round the fractional solution into a channel transmission schedule for the physical systems. Experiments show consistent makespan reductions with near-zero bandwidth/energy violations and millisecond-order end-to-end runtime for typical edge server hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that enables channel sharing across DTs using operations that do not expose private data."}

However, ML notebooks are highly prone to bugs, with crashes being among the most disruptive. Despite their practical importance, systematic methods for crash detection and diagnosis in ML notebooks remain largely unexplored. We present CRANE-LLM, a novel approach that augments large language models (LLMs) with structured runtime information extracted from the notebook kernel state to detect and diagnose crashes before executing a target cell. Given previously executed cells and a target cell, CRANE-LLM combines static code context with runtime information, including object types, tensor shapes, and data attributes, to predict whether the target cell will crash (detection) and explain the underlying cause (diagnosis). We evaluate CRANE-LLM on JunoBench, a benchmark of 222 ML notebooks comprising 111 pairs of crashing and corresponding non-crashing notebooks across multiple ML libraries and crash root causes. Across three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini, Qwen, and GPT-5), runtime information improves crash detection and diagnosis by 7-10 percentage points in accuracy and 8-11 in F1-score, with larger gains for diagnosis. Improvements vary across ML libraries, crash causes, and LLMs, and depends on the integration of complementary categories of runtime information."}

However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry.

However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL.

We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning."}

At fine timescales, BiScale dynamically adapts GPU frequency per iteration using stage-specific control: model predictive control (MPC) for prefill to account for queue evolution and future TTFT impact, and lightweight slack-aware adaptation for decode to exploit its smoother, memory-bound dynamics. This hierarchical design enables coordinated control across timescales while preserving strict serving SLOs.\n  Evaluation on a 16x H100 cluster serving Llama 3.3 70B with production-style traces shows that BiScale meets TTFT/TPOT SLOs while reducing energy by up to 39% in prefill and 48% in decode relative to DistServe."}

Acoustic sensing remains the most practical choice, but conventional acoustic systems typically rely on large arrays or multiple synchronized anchors, resulting in high hardware costs and complex deployment. This paper introduces a novel low-cost passive acoustic metasurface, MetaBlue , explicitly designed for underwater localization, which, when attached to an ordinary ultrasonic transmitter, transforms it into a directional \"super-transmitter.\" The metasurface embeds direction-dependent spectral patterns into the transmitted waveform, enabling accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation using only a single hydrophone. For ranging, we present a new EM-acoustic mixed time-of-arrival (ToA) method that leverages the acoustic transducer's inherent low-frequency EM leakage as a timing reference, enabling precise ranging without shared clocks. This allows complete 3D localization with a single low-cost anchor. We evaluate the system across diverse real-world underwater settings, including pools, tanks, and outdoor environments. Experiments show that our design achieves an average AoA error of 8.7 degree and 3D localization error of 0.37 m at distances over 10 m. Even with a single anchor, the system maintains 0.73 m precision."}

While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.\n  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.\n  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings."}

In environments with limited bandwidth, degraded infrastructure, or adversarial interference, existing approaches degrade sharply. We introduce a learning-based framework that achieves high-quality task allocation without any robot-to-robot communication. The key idea is that robots coordinate implicitly by predicting teammates' bids: if each robot can anticipate competition for a task, it can adjust its choices accordingly. Our method predicts bid distributions to correct systematic errors in analytical mean-field approximations. While analytical predictions assume idealized conditions (uniform distributions, known bid functions), our learned approach adapts to task clustering and spatial heterogeneity. Inspired by Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO), we train predictors end-to-end to minimize Task Allocation Regret rather than prediction error. To scale to large swarms, we develop a mean-field approximation where each robot predicts the distribution of competing bids rather than individual bids, reducing complexity from $O(NT)$ to $O(T)$. We call our approach FORMICA: Field-Oriented Regret-Minimizing Implicit Coordination Algorithm. Experiments show FORMICA substantially outperforms a natural analytical baseline. In scenarios with 16 robots and 64 tasks, our approach improves system reward by 17% and approaches the optimal MILP solution. When deployed on larger scenarios (256 robots, 4096 tasks), the same model improves performance by 7%, demonstrating strong generalization.

Efficient evaluation is critical for real-time applications, yet existing approaches face a quality-performance trade-off: bilinear LUT sampling is fast but produces faceting, while bicubic filtering requires 16 texture samples. Most implementations use finite differences for normals, requiring extra samples and introducing noise. This paper presents Spherical Hermite Maps, a derivative-augmented LUT representation that resolves this trade-off. By storing function values alongside scaled partial derivatives at each texel of a padded cubemap, bicubic-Hermite reconstruction is enabled from only four texture samples (a 2x2 footprint) while providing continuous gradients from the same samples. The key insight is that Hermite interpolation reconstructs smooth derivatives as a byproduct of value reconstruction, making surface normals effectively free. In controlled experiments, Spherical Hermite Maps improve PSNR by 8-41 dB over bilinear interpolation and match 16-tap bicubic quality at one-quarter the cost. Analytic normals reduce mean angular error by 9-13% on complex surfaces while yielding stable specular highlights. Three applications demonstrate versatility: spherical harmonic glyph visualization, radial depth-map impostors for mesh level-of-detail, and procedural planet/asteroid rendering with spherical heightfields."}

Spatiotemporal mismatches between stochastic task arrivals and intermittent green energy along with complex inter-user interference in multi-antenna (MIMO) uplinks complicate real-time resource management. Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines. The framework achieves the lowest carbon intensity and maintains near-zero packet overflow rates under extreme traffic loads. Architectural profiling validates the framework to demonstrate a constant $O(1)$ inference complexity and theoretical lightweight feasibility for future generation sustainable IoT deployments."}

Federated learning, though designed to exploit distributed data and computational resources, faces data shortage from limited network coverage and computational constraints from edge devices. To address these issues, both the mixture-of-experts (MoE) and satellite-terrestrial network (STN) provide promising solutions, offering lightweight computation overhead and broad coverage, respectively. However, the satellite-ground relative motion results in intermittent connectivity, hindering conventional federated learning that relies on model synchronization across devices. To leverage the coverage of STN while preserving training efficiency, we propose EMS-FL, an expert-driven model splitting and federated learning method. EMS-FL assigns each device cluster only the experts highly correlated to their local data. Through non-overlapping expert assignments, asynchronous local learning is further proposed, where each device cluster trains its assigned experts consecutively and only uploads local parameters to the satellite during connected phases for aggregation and model updates. Consequently, EMS-FL effectively reduces the training overhead and achieves both faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with conventional federated learning. Rigorous convergence analysis is provided to theoretically characterize the learning performance. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments are conducted using public datasets and large models, validating the superiority of EMS-FL."}

This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency."}

Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization.

Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) schemes address this by introducing end-to-end mappings from actuation to task space for the controller to operate on, but typically assume finite dimensions of the underlying virtual configuration space. In this work, we extend CLIK to the infinite-dimensional domain to reason about the entire soft robot shape while solving tasks. We do this by composing an actuation-to-shape map with a shape-to-task map, deriving the differential end-to-end kinematics via an infinite-dimensional chain rule, and thereby obtaining a Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm. Since the actuation-to-shape mapping is rarely available in closed form, we propose to learn it from simulation data using neural operator networks, which are differentiable. We first present an analytical study on a constant-curvature segment, and then apply the neural version of the algorithm to a three-fiber soft robotic arm whose underlying model relies on morphoelasticity and active filament theory. This opens new possibilities for differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in a continuous, infinite-dimensional framework."}

Furthermore, based on the MCS ordering, we introduce a recursive algorithm for decomposing an undirected graph into its atoms. This approach closely aligns with the results of chordal graph decomposition. As a result, minimal triangulation of the graph is no longer required, and the identification of clique minimal separators is avoided. In the experimental section, we combine the proposed decomposition algorithm with two existing convex expansion methods.

Debugging and investigation of runtime behavior remains largely a manual, developer-driven process. Popular coding agents typically rely on either static analysis of the code or iterative test-fix cycles, which is akin to trial and error debugging. We posit that there is a wealth of rich runtime information that developers routinely access while debugging code, which agents are currently deprived of due to design limitations. Despite how prevalent debuggers are in modern IDEs and command-line tools, they have surprisingly not made their way into coding agents. In this work, we introduce Debug2Fix, a novel framework that incorporates interactive debugging as a core component of a software engineering agent via a subagent architecture. We incorporate debuggers for Java and Python into our agent framework and evaluate against GitBug-Java and SWE-Bench-Live and achieve >20% improvement in performance compared to the baseline for certain models. Furthermore, using our framework, we're able to make weaker models like GPT-5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 match or exceed the performances of stronger models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, showing that better tool design is often just as important as switching to a more expensive model. Finally, we conduct systematic ablations demonstrating the importance of both the subagent architecture and debugger integration."}

Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models."}

In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs."}

Robotic harvesting has emerged as a promising alternative; however, evaluating and training soft grippers for delicate fruits remains difficult due to the highly variable mechanical properties of natural produce. This makes it difficult to establish reliable benchmarks or data-driven control strategies. Existing testing practices rely on large quantities of real fruit to capture this variability, leading to inefficiency, higher costs, and waste. The methodology presented in this work aims to address these limitations by developing tunable soft physical twins that emulate the stiffness characteristics of real fruits at different ripeness levels. A fiber-reinforced pneumatic physical twin of a kiwi fruit was designed and fabricated to replicate the stiffness at different ripeness levels. Experimental results show that the stiffness of the physical twin can be tuned accurately over multiple trials (97.35 - 99.43% accuracy). Gripping tasks with a commercial robotic gripper showed that sensor feedback from the physical twin can reflect the applied gripping forces. Finally, a stress test was performed over 50 cycles showed reliable maintenance of desired stiffness (0.56 - 1.10% error). This work shows promise that robotic physical twins could adjust their stiffness to resemble that of real fruits. This can provide a sustainable, controllable platform for benchmarking and training robotic grippers."}

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman."}

However, the independent ICP adjustments made by these applications can inadvertently create conflicts- direct, indirect, and implicit, which lead to network instability and KPI degradation. Traditional rule-based conflict management becomes increasingly impractical as Open RAN scales in terms of xApps, associated ICPs, and relevant KPIs, struggling to handle the complexity of multi-xApp interactions. This highlights the necessity for AI-driven solutions that can efficiently detect, classify, and mitigate conflicts in real-time. This paper proposes an AI-powered framework for conflict detection, classification, and mitigation in Open RAN. We introduce GenC, a synthetic conflict generation framework for large-scale labeled datasets with controlled parameter sharing and realistic class imbalance, enabling robust training and evaluation of AI models. Our classification pipeline leverages GNNs, Bi-LSTM, and SMOTE-enhanced GNNs, with results demonstrating SMOTE-GNN's superior robustness in handling imbalanced data. Experimental validation using both synthetic datasets (5-50 xApps) and realistic ns3-oran simulations with OpenCellID-derived Dublin topology shows that AI-based methods achieve 3.2x faster classification than rule-based approaches while maintaining near-perfect accuracy. Our framework successfully addresses Energy Saving (ES)/Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) conflict scenarios using realistic ns3-oran and scales efficiently to large-scale xApp environments. By embedding this workflow into Open RAN's AI-driven architecture, our solution ensures autonomous and self-optimizing conflict management, paving the way for resilient, ultra-low-latency, and energy-efficient 6G networks."}

Prior work based on static metrics has not shown clear differences between these practices, and the human side of comprehension and navigation remains underexplored. We investigate Inline Method vs. Extract Method refactorings using a dynamic approach: eye tracking while participants read and solve tasks. We analyze key code areas and compare visual effort and reading behavior (fixation duration and count, regressions, revisits), alongside time and attempts. We ran a controlled experiment with 32 Java novices, followed by short interviews. Each participant solved eight simple tasks across four programs presented in an inlined version and four in an extracted version. We also surveyed 58 additional novices for complementary quantitative and qualitative data. Results show that effects depend on task difficulty. In two tasks, method extraction improved performance and reduced visual effort, with time decreasing by up to 78.8% and regressions by 84.6%. For simpler tasks (e.g., square area), extraction hurt performance: time increased by up to 166.9% and regressions by 200%. Even with meaningful method names, novices often switched back and forth between call sites and extracted methods, increasing navigation and cognitive load. Preferences frequently favored extraction for readability and reuse, but did not always match measured performance.

Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation.

To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines."}

We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

To tackle these limitations, we propose in this correspondence a novel end-to-end generative framework for beam prediction, called BeamVLM, which treats beam prediction as a vision question answering task capitalizing on powerful existing vision-language models (VLMs). By projecting raw visual patches directly into the language domain and judiciously designing an instructional prompt, the proposed BeamVLM enables the VLM to jointly reason over UAV trajectories and environmental context. Last, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed BeamVLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and also exhibits superior generalization for other scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) beam prediction."}

Existing ROS~2 modeling approaches cover node-level entities and wiring, but do not make hierarchical structural (de-)composition a first-class architectural view independent of launch artifacts.\n  We contribute (1) a UML-based modeling concept for hierarchical structural architectures of ROS~2 systems and (2) a blueprint-guided automated recovery pipeline that reconstructs such models from code and configuration artifacts by combining deterministic extraction with LLM-based agents. The ROS~2 architectural blueprint (nodes, topics, interfaces, launch-induced wiring) is encoded as structural contracts to constrain synthesis and enable deterministic validation, improving reliability.\n  We evaluate the approach on three ROS~2 repositories, including an industrial-scale code subset.

We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply.

Both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors of a representative ACM are analyzed. The primary objective is to determine the conditions under which the decoupled model attains accuracy comparable to the coupled model while offering reduced computational cost under identical numerical conditions. The system dynamics are first derived using the Euler--Lagrange method under the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, with explicit treatment of the near-zero curvature singularity. A decoupled model is then obtained by neglecting the coupling terms in the ACM dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of open-loop responses under diverse actuation profiles and external wrenches. To extend the analysis to closed-loop performance, a novel dynamics-based proportional-derivative sliding mode image-based visual servoing (DPD-SM-IBVS) controller is developed for regulating image feature errors in the presence of a moving target. The controller is implemented with both coupled and decoupled models, allowing a direct comparison of their effectiveness. The open-loop simulations reveal pronounced discrepancies between the two modeling approaches, particularly under varying torque inputs and continuum arm parameters. Conversely, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the decoupled model achieves tracking accuracy on par with the coupled model (within subpixel error) while incurring lower computational cost."}

We provide proofs for the maximal always-coverable polyominoes and construct concrete counterexamples for the minimal not always-coverable ones, demonstrating that such cases exist even among hole-free polyominoes. This classification consequently yields an algorithm to determine the always-coverability of any given stain. We also show that the problem of determining whether a given sticker can cover a given stain is $\\NP$-complete, even though exact cover is not demanded. This result extends to the 1D case where the connectivity requirement is removed. As an illustration of the problem complexity, for a specific hexomino (6-cell) stain, the smallest sticker found in our search that avoids covering it has, although not proven minimum, a bounding box of $325 \\times 325$."}

However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yyyykf/RAP."}

The model identifies conflicts using semantic dependencies between operations and resolves them by rebasing conflicting operations onto a reconciling operation via a three-way merge over a replicated journal.

At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks. Simulation results using the DESERT Underwater Network Simulator demonstrate throughput gains of up to 20.61% and energy savings of up to 36.60% compared with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baselines reported in the existing literature."}

Approaches that instead explore new sequences dynamically lack the expressiveness to model real-world usage constraints leading to false positives from straightforward API misuse.\n  We propose stitching, a technique that encodes API usage constraints in pieces that a fuzzer dynamically assembles at runtime. A static type system governs how objects flow between blocks, while a dynamically-checked extrinsic typestate tracks arbitrary metadata across blocks, enabling specifications to express rich semantic constraints such as object state dependencies and cross-function preconditions. This allows a single specification to describe an open-ended space of valid API interactions that the fuzzer explores guided by coverage feedback.\n  We implement stitching in STITCH, using LLMs to automatically configure projects for fuzzing, synthesize a specification, triage crashes, and repair the specification itself. We evaluated STITCH against four state-of-the-art tools on 33 benchmarks, where it achieved the highest code coverage on 21 and found 30 true-positive bugs compared to 10 by all other tools combined, with substantially higher precision (70% vs. 12% for the next-best LLM-based tool).

We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95).

Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level."}

Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution.

Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion."}

Our method builds on a modified version of Johnson algorithm and enables test cases to be generated incrementally and on demand, rather than requiring the entire test suite to be computed upfront. This streaming capability represents a substantial advancement over existing approaches, as it allows testers to begin executing and refining tests immediately, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of test design. Our solution is inherently memory efficient, as it does not store all discovered coverage items; instead, it retains only the minimal set of paths required to generate subsequent coverage items on the fly. As a result, the approach scales to arbitrarily large graphs. In addition, the algorithm gives testers explicit control over the size of the generated test suite by allowing them to restrict the number of cycles permitted in a test path. The approach is grounded in new theoretical insights, most notably a novel characterization of prime paths in terms of the strongly connected components of control-flow graphs. We complement these theoretical contributions with a practical implementation and a comprehensive empirical evaluation.

In CLASH, a base model is first distilled from an imperfect simulator (MuJoCo) to capture general physical priors; this model is then fine-tuned with a remarkably small number of real-world interactions (as few as 10 samples) to correct for the simulator's inherent inaccuracies. The resulting hybrid simulator not only achieves higher predictive accuracy but also reduces collision computation time by nearly 50\\%. We demonstrate that policies obtained with our hybrid simulator transfer more robustly to the real world, doubling the success rate in sequential pushing tasks with reinforecement learning and significantly increase the task performance with model-based control."}

To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field.

Parker et al. showed in 1983 that network partitioning destroys mutual consistency; iCloud adds a user interface that conceals this impossibility behind a facade of seamlessness. This document presents a unified analysis of why iCloud fails when composed with Time Machine, git, automated toolchains, and general-purpose developer workflows, supported by direct evidence including documented corruption events and a case study involving 366 GB of divergent state accumulated through normal use. We show that the failures arise from five interlocking incompatibilities rooted in a single structural error: the projection of a distributed causal graph onto a linear temporal chain. We then show how the same Category Mistake, when it occurs in network fabrics as link flapping, destroys topology knowledge through epistemic collapse. Finally, we argue that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) transactional semantics -- bilateral, reversible, and conservation-preserving -- provide the structural foundation for resolving these failures, not by defeating physics, but by aligning protocol behavior with physical reality."}

To address this problem, we propose a robustness evaluation method called scenario domain analysis, which aims to find the expected minimal change in the natural language descriptions of coding tasks that would cause the LLMs to produce incorrect outputs. We have formally proved the theoretical properties of the method and also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art art LLMs: Gemini-pro, Codex, Llamma2 and Falcon 7B, and have found that we are able to rank these with confidence from best to worst. Moreover, we have also studied how robustness varies in different scenarios, including the variations with the topic of the coding task and with the complexity of its sample solution, and found that robustness is lower for more complex tasks and also lower for more advanced topics, such as multi-threading and data structures."}

In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling.

Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset."}

Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers."}

To this end, we present the first systematic study of description smells in MCP tool descriptions and their impact on usability. Specifically, we synthesize software/API documentation practices and agentic tool-use requirements into a four-dimensional quality standard: accuracy, functionality, information completeness, and conciseness, covering 18 specific smell categories. Using this standard, we conducted a large-scale empirical study on a well-constructed dataset of 10,831 MCP servers. We find that description smells are pervasive (e.g., 73% repeated tool names, thousands with incorrect parameter semantics or missing return descriptions), reflecting a \"code-first, description-last\" pattern. Through a controlled mutation-based study, we show these smells significantly affect LLM tool selection, with functionality and accuracy having the largest effects (+11.6% and +8.8%, p < 0.001). In competitive settings with functionally equivalent servers, standard-compliant descriptions reach 72% selection probability (260% over a 20% baseline), demonstrating that smell-guided remediation yields substantial practical benefits.

GeneBench leverages a multi-objective optimization to increase the complexity of programming problems while maintaining the readability of code similar to real-world programs. Transforming four widely-used programming benchmarks using GeneBench and evaluating 13 LLMs (including two reasoning LLMs) on them shows a notable performance drop across all programming tasks (14.9%-60.5%, avg=35.2%), demonstrating LLMs' struggle under real-world complexities. The struggle persists even when LLMs are few-shot prompted or fine-tuned with examples from different versions of GeneBench, demonstrating the challenging nature of the problems. Finally, we show that the performance of the studied LLMs in bug repair is similar under GeneBench and SWE-Bench.

A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity.

Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \\emph{cr-}, \\emph{sn-}, \\emph{-oid}, \\emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55).

This creates robot-agnostic visual guidance that easily integrates with local planning. Consequently, our model's predictions provide guidance zero-shot across diverse embodiments. By decoupling perception from action and learning to localize trajectory points rather than imitate behavioral priors, we enable a cross-trajectory training strategy for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes. We outperform state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation, achieving 94-98% success rate across diverse sim and real environments.

Habitats are fragmented into patches and we seek to reconnect each habitat such that it remains connected even if any of its patches becomes unavailable. Formally, we are given an undirected graph with edge costs, a set of fixed green bridges represented as a subset of the graph's edges, a set of habitats represented as vertex subsets, and some budget. We decide whether there exists a subset of the graph's edges containing all fixed green bridges such that, for each habitat, the induced subgraph on the solution edges is 2-vertex-connected, and the total cost does not exceed the budget. We also study the 2-edge-connectivity variant, modeling the case where any single reconnecting green bridge may fail. We analyze the computational complexity of these problems, focusing on the boundary between NP-hardness and polynomial-time solvability when the maximum habitat size and maximum vertex degree are bounded by constants. We prove that for each constant maximum habitat size of at least four there exists a small constant maximum degree for which the problems are NP-hard, and complement this with polynomial-time algorithms yielding partial dichotomies for bounded habitat size and degree."}

We further propose three methods to use our optimization depending on the situation: (i) Eigenbasis Weight Transformation (EWT), which preserves the dynamics of standard and trained Linear ESNs, (ii) End-to-End Eigenbasis Training (EET), which directly optimizes readout weights in the transformed space and (iii) Direct Parameter Generation (DPG), that bypasses matrix diagonalization by directly sampling eigenvalues and eigenvectors, achieving comparable performance than standard Linear ESNs. Across all experiments, both our methods preserve predictive accuracy while offering significant computational speedups, making them a replacement of standard Linear ESNs computations and training, and suggesting a shift of paradigm in linear ESN towards the direct selection of eigenvalues."}

While extensive research has examined the impact of flaky tests, many root causes remain unexplored, particularly in the context of dynamic languages such as JavaScript. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of the impact of environmental factors on test flakiness in JavaScript. We first executed test suites across multiple environmental configurations to determine whether changes in the environment could lead to flaky behavior. We selected three environmental factors to manipulate: the operating system, the Node.js version, and the browser. We identified a total of 65 environmental flaky projects, with 28 related to operating system issues, five to Node.js version compatibility, 16 to a combination of operating system and Node.js issues, and 17 related to browser compatibility. To address environmental flakiness, we developed a lightweight mitigation approach, js-env-sanitizer, that can sanitize environmental-related flaky tests by skipping and reporting them (rather than failing), allowing CI builds to continue/succeed without rerunning entire test suites. The tool achieves high accuracy with minimal performance or configuration overhead, and currently supports three popular JavaScript testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, and Vitest)"}

To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\\% to 75.70\\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o.

To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments.

One of the most prominent linear programming relaxations for Steiner Tree is the Bidirected Cut Relaxation (BCR). Determining the integrality gap of this relaxation is a long-standing open question. For several decades, the best known upper bound was 2, which is achievable by standard techniques. Only very recently, Byrka, Grandoni, and Traub [FOCS 2024] showed that the integrality gap of BCR is strictly below 2.\n  We prove that the integrality gap of BCR is at most 1.898, improving significantly on the previous bound of 1.9988. For the important special case where a terminal minimum spanning tree is an optimal Steiner tree, we show that the integrality gap is at most 12/7, by providing a tight analysis of the dual-growth procedure by Byrka et al. To obtain the general bound of 1.898 on the integrality gap, we generalize their dual growth procedure to a broad class of moat-growing algorithms. Moreover, we prove that no such moat-growing algorithm yields dual solutions certifying an integrality gap below 12/7.\n  Finally, we observe an interesting connection to the Hypergraphic Relaxation."}

Pre-quantization, a critical technique to remove sequential dependency and enable high parallelism, is widely used to design and develop high-throughput error-controlled data compressors. Despite the extremely high throughput of pre-quantization based compressors, they generally suffer from low data quality with medium or large user-specified error bounds. In this paper, we investigate the artifacts generated by pre-quantization based compressors and propose a novel algorithm to mitigate them. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) We carefully characterize the artifacts in pre-quantization based compressors to understand the correlation between the quantization index and compression error; (2) We propose a novel quantization-aware interpolation algorithm to improve the decompressed data; (3) We parallelize our algorithm in both shared-memory and distributed-memory environments to obtain high performance; (4) We evaluate our algorithm and validate it with two leading pre-quantization based compressors using five real-world datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our artifact mitigation algorithm can effectively improve the quality of decompressed data produced by pre-quantization based compressors while maintaining their high compression throughput."}

Given a task, existing systems use LLMs to plan and generate tool calls, which are executed by real-world tools to complete the task. However, tool calls are prone to errors because they are derived merely from LLM intrinsic capabilities. What is more, while it is useful to let LLMs iteratively refine the tool-call sequence using execution results from real tools, this process can be expensive and lead to unsafe results. To improve LLM tool calls and address issues caused by using real tools for refinement, we introduce Gecko, a comprehensive environment that simulates tool responses using a combination of rules and LLMs. Specifically, Gecko checks the validity of tool calls including input arguments and tool names, synthesizes reasonable responses that adhere to the output schema, and assesses whether all task objectives have been achieved. These three types of feedback provided by Gecko allow LLMs to refine their tool calls, forming a simple yet effective test-time scaling method named GATS. On BFCLv3 and $τ^2$-bench, GATS consistently improves the tool calling performance of various LLMs including GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-3.0-pro.

Twin-width is a natural complexity measure of matrices (and more general structures) that has recently emerged as a unifying concept with important algorithmic applications. While the twin-width of a matrix is invariant to re-ordering rows and columns, most of its algorithmic applications to date assume that the input is given in a certain canonical ordering that yields a bounded twin-width contraction sequence. In general, efficiently finding such a sequence -- even for an approximate twin-width value -- remains a central and elusive open question.\n  In this paper we show that a binary $n \\times n$ matrix of twin-width $d$ can be preprocessed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}_d(n^2)$ time, so that its product with any vector can be computed in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}_d(n)$ time. Notably, the twin-width of the input matrix need not be known and no particular ordering of its rows and columns is assumed. If a canonical ordering is available, i.e., if the input matrix is $d$-twin-ordered, then the runtime of preprocessing and matrix-vector products can be further reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2+dn)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(dn)$.\n  Consequently, we can multiply two $n \\times n$ matrices in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$ time, when at least one of the matrices consists of 0/1 entries and has bounded twin-width. The results also extend to the case of bounded twin-width matrices with adversarial corruption.

However, existing protocols rely on limited simulation datasets, prioritise simple metrics such as success rate, and overlook key object and environment-related pre-grasp conditions. This paper introduces GRAB, a comprehensive Grasping Real-World Article Benchmarking framework that addresses this gap by integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision, and, importantly, pre-grasp conditions, establishing a set of critical graspability metrics. It systematically compares industrial grasping modalities through an in-depth experimental evaluation involving 1,750 food contaminant grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes. This large-scale evaluation provides an extensive assessment of grasp performance for food waste sorting, offering a level of depth that has rarely been explored in previous studies. The results reveal distinct gripper strengths and limitations, with object quality emerging as the dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels play moderate roles. These findings highlight essential design considerations and reinforce the necessity of developing multimodal gripper technologies capable of robust cross-category performance for effective robotic food waste sorting."}

Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation."}

We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation."}

In this work, it is analyzed the use of four different communication systems with a human-robot collaborative object transportation task as experimental testbed: two intention predictors (one based on force prediction and another with an enhanced velocity prediction algorithm) and two explicit communication methods (a button interface and a voice-command recognition system). These systems were integrated into IVO, a custom mobile social robot equipped with force sensor to detect the force exchange between both agents and LiDAR to detect the environment. The collaborative task required transporting an object over a 5-7 meter distance with obstacles in the middle, demanding rapid decisions and precise physical coordination. 75 volunteers perform a total of 255 executions divided into three groups, testing inference systems in the first round, communication systems in the second, and the combined strategies in the third. The results show that, 1) once sufficient performance is achieved, the human no longer notices and positively assesses technical improvements; 2) the human prefers systems that are more natural to them even though they have higher failure rates; and 3) the preferred option is the right combination of both systems."}

Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime. We hope this work motivates a broader exploration of coordinated noise in game AI as a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality."}

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based musculoskeletal simulation framework to (1) quantify how progressive unilateral muscle weakness affects gait symmetry and (2) evaluate whether ankle exoskeleton assistance can improve gait symmetry under impaired conditions. The overarching goal is to establish a simulation- and learning-based workflow that supports early controller development prior to patient experiments. Asymmetric gait was induced by reducing right-leg muscle strength to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline. Gait asymmetry was quantified using toe-off timing, peak contact forces, and joint-level symmetry metrics. Increasing weakness produced progressively larger temporal and kinematic asymmetry, most pronounced at the ankle. Ankle range of motion symmetry degraded from near-symmetric behavior at 100% strength (symmetry index, SI = +6.4%; correlation r=0.974) to severe asymmetry at 25% strength (SI = -47.1%, r=0.889), accompanied by a load shift toward the unimpaired limb. At 50% strength, ankle exoskeleton assistance improved kinematic symmetry relative to the unassisted impaired condition, reducing the magnitude of ankle SI from 25.8% to 18.5% and increasing ankle correlation from r=0.948 to 0.966, although peak loading remained biased toward the unimpaired side. Overall, this framework supports controlled evaluation of impairment severity and assistive strategies, and provides a basis for future validation in human experiments."}

Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance."}

In this paper we test the assumption that the same source code is being used by those alternative builds. To study this, we compare the sources released with packages on Maven Central, with the sources associated with independently built packages from Google's Assured Open Source and Oracle's Build-from-Source projects. We study non-equivalent sources for alternative builds of 28 popular packages with 85 releases.

By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability."}

This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence."}

Effective code localization requires understanding both organizational context (e.g., historical issue-fix patterns) and structural relationships within heterogeneous codebases.

We present Multi-CoLoR, a framework for Context-aware Localization and Reasoning across Multi-Language codebases, which integrates organizational knowledge retrieval with graph-based reasoning to traverse complex software ecosystems. Multi-CoLoR operates in two stages: (i) a similar issue context (SIC) module retrieves semantically and organizationally related historical issues to prune the search space, and (ii) a code graph traversal agent (an extended version of LocAgent, a state-of-the-art localization framework) performs structural reasoning within C++ and QML codebases. Evaluations on a real-world enterprise dataset show that incorporating SIC reduces the search space and improves localization accuracy, and graph-based reasoning generalizes effectively beyond Python-only repositories.

While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead."}

Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available."}

We evaluate TactEx on fruit-ripeness assessment, a representative task that requires both tactile sensing and contextual understanding. The system fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts. A ResNet50+LSTM model estimates hardness from sequential tactile data, while a cross-modal alignment module combines visual cues with guidance from a large language model (LLM). This explainable multimodal interface allows users to distinguish ripeness levels with statistically significant class separation (p < 0.01 for all fruit pairs). For touch placement, we compare YOLO with Grounded-SAM (GSAM) and find GSAM to be more robust for fine-grained segmentation and contact-site selection. A lightweight LLM parses user instructions and produces grounded natural-language explanations linked to the tactile outputs. In end-to-end evaluations, TactEx attains 90% task success on simple user queries and generalises to novel tasks without large-scale tuning.

Using logistic regression with repository-clustered standard errors, we find that reviewer engagement has the strongest correlation with successful integration, whereas larger change sizes and coordination-disrupting actions, such as force pushes, are associated with a lower likelihood of merging. In contrast, iteration intensity alone provides limited explanatory power once collaboration signals are considered. A qualitative analysis further shows that successful integration occurs when agents engage in actionable review loops that converge toward reviewer expectations.

Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance."}

A key challenge in such aerial physical interactions lies in handling uncertain contact forces on unknown targets, which typically demand accurate sensing and active control. We present a drone platform with elastic horns that enables touch-and-go manoeuvres - a self-regulated, consecutive bumping motion that allows the drone to maintain proximity to a wall without relying on active obstacle avoidance. It leverages environmental interaction as a form of embodied control, where low-level stabilisation and near-obstacle navigation emerge from the passive dynamic responses of the drone-obstacle system that resembles a mass-spring-damper system. Experiments show that the elastic horn can absorb impact energy while maintaining vehicle stability, reducing pitch oscillations by 38% compared to the rigid horn configuration. The lower horn arrangement was found to reduce pitch oscillations by approximately 54%. In addition to intermittent contact, the platform equipped with elastic horns also demonstrates stable, sustained contact with static objects, relying on a standard attitude PID controller."}

However, with growing global participation and better support for non-Latin scripts through standards like Unicode, OSS is gradually becoming more multilingual. This study investigates the extent to which OSS is becoming more multilingual, analyzing 9.14 billion GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions, and 62,500 repositories across five programming languages and 30 natural languages, covering the period from 2015 to 2025. We examine six research questions to track changes in language use across communication, code, and documentation. We find that multilingual participation has steadily increased, especially in Korean, Chinese, and Russian. This growth appears not only in issues and discussions but also in code comments, string literals, and documentation files. While this shift reflects greater inclusivity and language diversity in OSS, it also creates language tension. The ability to express oneself in a native language can clash with shared norms around English use, especially in collaborative settings. Non-English or multilingual projects tend to receive less visibility and participation, suggesting that language remains both a resource and a barrier, shaping who gets heard, who contributes, and how open collaboration unfolds."}

Subtle motion blur remains a pervasive quality issue, reducing visual clarity and negatively affecting user trust and click-through rates. However, motion blur detection from static images is underexplored, as existing methods and datasets focus on severe blur and lack fine-grained pixel-level annotations needed for quality-critical applications. Benchmarks such as GOPRO and NFS are dominated by strong synthetic blur and often contain residual blur in their sharp references, leading to ambiguous supervision. We propose SMBlurDetect, a unified framework combining high-quality motion blur specific dataset generation with an end-to-end detector capable of zero-shot detection at multiple granularities. Our pipeline synthesizes realistic motion blur from super high resolution aesthetic images using controllable camera and object motion simulations over SAM segmented regions, enhanced with alpha-aware compositing and balanced sampling to generate subtle, spatially localized blur with precise ground truth masks. We train a U-Net based detector with ImageNet pretrained encoders using a hybrid mask and image centric strategy incorporating curriculum learning, hard negatives, focal loss, blur frequency channels, and resolution aware augmentation.Our method achieves strong zero-shot generalization, reaching 89.68% accuracy on GoPro (vs 66.50% baseline) and 59.77% Mean IoU on CUHK (vs 9.00% baseline), demonstrating 6.6x improvement in segmentation. Qualitative results show accurate localization of subtle blur artifacts, enabling automated filtering of low quality frames and precise region of interest extraction for intelligent cropping."}

A Pilot Study on Screen-Only Navigation in Commercial 3D ARPGs", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern 3D game levels rely heavily on visual guidance, yet the navigability of level layouts remains difficult to quantify. Prior work either simulates play in simplified environments or analyzes static screenshots for visual affordances, but neither setting faithfully captures how players explore complex, real-world game levels. In this paper, we build on an existing open-source visual affordance detector and instantiate a screen-only exploration and navigation agent that operates purely from visual affordances. Our agent consumes live game frames, identifies salient interest points, and drives a simple finite-state controller over a minimal action space to explore Dark Souls-style linear levels and attempt to reach expected goal regions. Pilot experiments show that the agent can traverse most required segments and exhibits meaningful visual navigation behavior, but also highlight that limitations of the underlying visual model prevent truly comprehensive and reliable auto-navigation. We argue that this system provides a concrete, shared baseline and evaluation protocol for visual navigation in complex games, and we call for more attention to this necessary task. Our results suggest that purely vision-based sense-making models, with discrete single-modality inputs and without explicit reasoning, can effectively support navigation and environment understanding in idealized settings, but are unlikely to be a general solution on their own."}

To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies.

We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task.

We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains.

It explores the principles of the artificial potential field, considering vehicle dynamics and local minimum reachability. The study first analyzes the most advanced traditional artificial potential field and its drawbacks in global and local path planning. It then introduces three modifications to the predictive artificial potential field-angle limit, velocity adjustment, and predictive potential to enhance the feasibility and flatness of the generated path. A comparison between the traditional and predictive artificial potential fields demonstrates that the latter successfully restricts the maximum turning angle, shortens sailing time, and intelligently avoids obstacles. Simulation results further verify that the predictive artificial potential field addresses the concave local minimum problem and improves reachability in special scenarios, ultimately generating a more efficient path that reduces sailing time and conserves energy for unmanned surface vehicles."}

Since MAS coordinate through unstructured natural language rather than rigid protocols, they are prone to semantic failures (e.g., hallucinations, misinterpreted instructions, and reasoning drift) that propagate silently without raising runtime exceptions. Prevailing evaluation approaches, which measure only end-to-end task success, offer limited insight into how these failures arise or how effectively agents recover from them. To bridge this gap, we propose MAS-FIRE, a systematic framework for fault injection and reliability evaluation of MAS. We define a taxonomy of 15 fault types covering intra-agent cognitive errors and inter-agent coordination failures, and inject them via three non-invasive mechanisms: prompt modification, response rewriting, and message routing manipulation. Applying MAS-FIRE to three representative MAS architectures, we uncover a rich set of fault-tolerant behaviors that we organize into four tiers: mechanism, rule, prompt, and reasoning. This tiered view enables fine-grained diagnosis of where and why systems succeed or fail. Our findings reveal that stronger foundation models do not uniformly improve robustness. We further show that architectural topology plays an equally decisive role, with iterative, closed-loop designs neutralizing over 40% of faults that cause catastrophic collapse in linear workflows. MAS-FIRE provides the process-level observability and actionable guidance needed to systematically improve multi-agent systems."}

To address the limitations of prior work that often relies on simulated or hypothetical settings, we investigate real-world robotaxi use through 18 semi-structured interviews and autoethnographic ride experiences. We found that users were drawn to robotaxis by low cost, social recommendation, and curiosity. They valued a distinctive set of benefits, such as an increased sense of agency, and consistent driving behavioral consistency and standardized ride experiences. However, they encountered persistent challenges around limited flexibility, insufficient transparency, management difficulty, robustness concerns in edge cases, and emergency handling concerns. Robotaxi experiences were shaped by privacy, safety, ethics, and trust. Users were often privacy-indifferent yet sensitive to opaque access and leakage risks; safety perceptions were polarized; and ethical considerations surfaced round issues such as accountability, feedback responsibility and absence of human-like social norms.

To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches."}

Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to \"reflect\", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step."}

From these data, we identify fires and use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to approximate the thermal radiation in empty spaces. This enables the construction of a continuous thermal radiation field over the environment. We show that this representation can be used for robot navigation, where we embed thermal constraints into the cost map to compute collision-free and thermally safe paths. We validate our approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in controlled experimental settings. Our experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to avoid hazardous regions while still reaching navigation goals. Our approach paves the way toward mobile robots that can be autonomously deployed in fire-affected environments, with potential applications in search-and-rescue, firefighting, and hazardous material response."}

At its core, the Act-Verify-Refine (AVR) loop functions as a closed-loop control system that transforms execution results into verified knowledge assets, driving system behavior toward asymptotic convergence to mission requirements (R). To operationalize this, this study introduces the Agentic Job Description (AJD), a formal specification tool that defines jurisdictional boundaries, operational contexts, and epistemic evaluation criteria.\n  The efficacy of this framework is validated through two contrasting case studies: a delegated proxy model for business travel and an autonomous supervisor model for industrial equipment management. By applying AJD-based specification and APF modeling to these scenarios, the analysis demonstrates how operational scenarios are systematically controlled within defined boundaries. These cases provide a conceptual proof that agent reliability stems not from a model's internal reasoning alone, but from the rigorous engineering structures that anchor stochastic AI within deterministic business processes, thereby enabling the development of verifiable and dependable domain agents."}

Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings."}

Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools."}

However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations.

Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels.

The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction."}

This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called \"sycophancy.\" In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling."}

Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm. Proof-of-concept object manipulation experiments including stacking, pouring, and pulling tasks are performed to demonstrate our controller's applicability."}

Our approach adaptively focuses on decision-relevant regions to achieve localized and semantically consistent counterfactual generation while preserving high image fidelity. Our training-free framework, MaskDiME, achieves over 30x faster inference than the baseline method and achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets spanning diverse visual domains, establishing a practical and generalizable solution for efficient counterfactual explanation."}

In scenarios where agents cannot confidently predict one another's intentions and plans, language communication can be crucial for ensuring safety. In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans. We also show that the combination of the VLM-based path editing program synthesis and model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability."}

We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \\emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains."}

To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards."}

In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy.

While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details.

Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps).

We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model.

HeRO employs dense semantics lifting to fuse discriminative, geometry-sensitive features from DINOv2 with the smooth, globally coherent correspondences from Stable Diffusion, yielding dense features that are both fine-grained and spatially consistent. These features are processed and partitioned to construct a global field and a set of local fields. A hierarchical conditioning module conditions the generative denoiser on global and local fields using permutation-invariant network architecture, thereby avoiding order-sensitive bias and producing a coherent control policy for pose-aware manipulation.

Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths.

Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group.

Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks."}

When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\\% vs. 28--98\\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings."}

In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches."}

However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%."}

However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters.

This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary."}

Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types."}

In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios."}

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language."}

A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability."}

Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) address the cold-start problem via zero-shot predictions, yet their temperature-scaled softmax outputs treat text-image similarities as deterministic scores while ignoring inherent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence misleads sample selection, wasting annotation budgets on uninformative cases. To overcome these limitations, the Similarity-as-Evidence (SaE) framework calibrates text-image similarities by introducing a Similarity Evidence Head (SEH), which reinterprets the similarity vector as evidence and parameterizes a Dirichlet distribution over labels. In contrast to a standard softmax that enforces confident predictions even under weak signals, the Dirichlet formulation explicitly quantifies lack of evidence (vacuity) and conflicting evidence (dissonance), thereby mitigating overconfidence caused by rigid softmax normalization. Building on this, SaE employs a dual-factor acquisition strategy: high-vacuity samples (e.g., rare diseases) are prioritized in early rounds to ensure coverage, while high-dissonance samples (e.g., ambiguous diagnoses) are prioritized later to refine boundaries, providing clinically interpretable selection rationales. Experiments on ten public medical imaging datasets with a 20% label budget show that SaE attains state-of-the-art macro-averaged accuracy of 82.57%. On the representative BTMRI dataset, SaE also achieves superior calibration, with a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of 0.425."}

In this work, we present a complete, open-source UAV system for online odor source localization using a minimal sensor suite. The system integrates custom olfaction hardware, onboard sensing, and a learning-based navigation policy trained in simulation and deployed on a real quadrotor. Through our minimal framework, the UAV is able to navigate directly toward an odor source without constructing an explicit gas distribution map or relying on external positioning systems. Vision is incorporated as an optional complementary modality to accelerate navigation under certain conditions. We validate the proposed system through real-world flight experiments in a large indoor environment using an ethanol source, demonstrating consistent source-finding behavior under realistic airflow conditions. The primary contribution of this work is a reproducible system and methodological framework for UAV-based olfactory navigation and source finding under minimal sensing assumptions.

To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy.

Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.\n  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.\n  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks.

In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines.

We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points.

Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods."}

To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm.

PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods."}

Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\\% of the time (versus 20\\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles.

To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques."}

However, the performance of these data-driven models fundamentally depends on the trade-off between sample size and model dimensions, a relationship for which the scaling laws have remained unclear. This paper establishes a rigorous framework to address this challenge by deriving and empirically validating scaling laws that connect sample size, latent space dimension, and downstream control quality. We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Koopman approximation error, explicitly decomposing it into sampling error and projection error. We show that these terms decay at specific rates relative to dataset size and latent dimension, providing a rigorous basis for the scaling law. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce two lightweight regularizers for the neural Koopman operator: a covariance loss to help stabilize the learned latent features and an inverse control loss to ensure the model aligns with physical actuation. The results from systematic experiments across six robotic environments confirm that model fitting error follows the derived scaling laws, and the regularizers improve dynamic model fitting fidelity, with enhanced closed-loop control performance. Together, our results provide a simple recipe for allocating effort between data collection and model capacity when learning Koopman dynamics for control."}

We show that as the encoder drifts, unselected code vectors fail to receive updates and gradually become inactive. To address this, we propose two new methods: Non-Stationary Vector Quantization (NSVQ), which propagates encoder drift to non-selected codes through a kernel-based rule, and Transformer-based Vector Quantization (TransVQ), which employs a lightweight mapping to adaptively transform the entire codebook while preserving convergence to the k-means solution.

Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively.

However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware."}

To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation.

Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios."}

This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution. Agents that embed adaptability at the core of imitation learning thus have an essential capability for operating in an open-ended world."}

While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.\n  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios."}

We propose a unified optimization-based formulation for real-to-sim scene estimation that jointly recovers the shapes and poses of multiple rigid objects under physical constraints. Our method is built on two key technical innovations. First, we leverage the recently introduced shape-differentiable contact model, whose global differentiability permits joint optimization over object geometry and pose while modeling inter-object contacts. Second, we exploit the structured sparsity of the augmented Lagrangian Hessian to derive an efficient linear system solver whose computational cost scales favorably with scene complexity. Building on this formulation, we develop an end-to-end real-to-sim scene estimation pipeline that integrates learning-based object initialization, physics-constrained joint shape-pose optimization, and differentiable texture refinement. Experiments on cluttered scenes with up to 5 objects and 22 convex hulls demonstrate that our approach robustly reconstructs physically valid, simulation-ready object shapes and poses."}

Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations.

To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives.

Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

Through 258 automated trials across 30 benchmark tasks on a production FastAPI repository, we demonstrate that graph-based structural navigation via CodeCompass--a Model Context Protocol server exposing dependency graphs--achieves 99.4% task completion on hidden-dependency tasks, a 23.2 percentage-point improvement over vanilla agents (76.2%) and 21.2 points over BM25 retrieval (78.2%).However, we uncover a critical adoption gap: 58% of trials with graph access made zero tool calls, and agents required explicit prompt engineering to adopt the tool consistently. Our findings reveal that the bottleneck is not tool availability but behavioral alignment--agents must be explicitly guided to leverage structural context over lexical heuristics. We contribute: (1) a task taxonomy distinguishing semantic-search, structural, and hidden-dependency scenarios; (2) empirical evidence that graph navigation outperforms retrieval when dependencies lack lexical overlap; and (3) open-source infrastructure for reproducible evaluation of navigation tools."}

We combine lexical metrics (Jaccard specificity), embedding-based semantic similarity, and LLM-as-judge validation to characterize agent interaction quality. Our findings reveal agents produce diverse, well-formed text that creates the surface appearance of active discussion, but the substance is largely absent. Specifically, while most agents ($67.5\\%$) vary their output across contexts, $65\\%$ of comments share no distinguishing content vocabulary with the post they appear under, and information gain from additional comments decays rapidly. LLM judge based metrics classify the dominant comment types as spam ($28\\%$) and off-topic content ($22\\%$). Embedding-based semantic analysis confirms that lexically generic comments are also semantically generic. Agents rarely engage in threaded conversation ($5\\%$ of comments), defaulting instead to independent top-level responses. We discuss implications for multi-agent interaction design, arguing that coordination mechanisms must be explicitly designed; without them, even large populations of capable agents produce parallel output rather than productive exchange."}

Under review", "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs."}

This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance."}

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.\n  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm."}

To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation.

To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies.

These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process.

We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss.

OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras.

Debugging and investigation of runtime behavior remains largely a manual, developer-driven process. Popular coding agents typically rely on either static analysis of the code or iterative test-fix cycles, which is akin to trial and error debugging. We posit that there is a wealth of rich runtime information that developers routinely access while debugging code, which agents are currently deprived of due to design limitations. Despite how prevalent debuggers are in modern IDEs and command-line tools, they have surprisingly not made their way into coding agents. In this work, we introduce Debug2Fix, a novel framework that incorporates interactive debugging as a core component of a software engineering agent via a subagent architecture. We incorporate debuggers for Java and Python into our agent framework and evaluate against GitBug-Java and SWE-Bench-Live and achieve >20% improvement in performance compared to the baseline for certain models. Furthermore, using our framework, we're able to make weaker models like GPT-5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 match or exceed the performances of stronger models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, showing that better tool design is often just as important as switching to a more expensive model. Finally, we conduct systematic ablations demonstrating the importance of both the subagent architecture and debugger integration."}

Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM.

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field.

Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention.

Learning-based control is effective in handling complex dynamics and represents the problem as a hybrid action space unifying discrete resource usage and continuous maneuvers. However, prior works on hybrid action space have not sufficiently captured the causal dependencies between resource usage and maneuvers. They have also overlooked the multi-modal nature of tactical decisions, both of which are critical in fast-evolving scenarios. In this paper, we propose TART, a Temporal Action Representation learning framework for Tactical resource control and subsequent maneuver generation. TART leverages contrastive learning based on a mutual information objective, designed to capture inherent temporal dependencies in resource-maneuver interactions. These learned representations are quantized into discrete codebook entries that condition the policy, capturing recurring tactical patterns and enabling multi-modal and temporally coherent behaviors. We evaluate TART in two domains where resource deployment is critical: (i) a maze navigation task where a limited budget of discrete actions provides enhanced mobility, and (ii) a high-fidelity air combat simulator in which an F-16 agent operates weapons and defensive systems in coordination with flight maneuvers. Across both domains, TART consistently outperforms hybrid-action baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in leveraging limited resources and producing context-aware subsequent maneuvers."}

The key insight is to lift \"coarse\" semantic cues into \"fine\" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the \"coarse\" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the \"fine\" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes.

In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains.

Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science."}

We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness.

Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap."}

Spatiotemporal mismatches between stochastic task arrivals and intermittent green energy along with complex inter-user interference in multi-antenna (MIMO) uplinks complicate real-time resource management. Traditional centralized optimization and off-policy reinforcement learning struggle with scalability and signaling overhead in dense networks. This paper proposes CADDTO-PPO, a carbon-aware decentralized dynamic task offloading framework based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization. The multi-user MIMO-MEC system is modeled as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP) to jointly minimize carbon emissions and buffer latency and energy wastage. A scalable architecture utilizes decentralized execution with parameter sharing (DEPS), which enables autonomous IoT agents to make fine-grained power control and offloading decisions based solely on local observations. Additionally, a carbon-first reward structure adaptively prioritizes green time slots for data transmission to decouple system throughput from grid-dependent carbon footprints. Finally, experimental results demonstrate CADDTO-PPO outperforms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and lyapunov-based baselines. The framework achieves the lowest carbon intensity and maintains near-zero packet overflow rates under extreme traffic loads. Architectural profiling validates the framework to demonstrate a constant $O(1)$ inference complexity and theoretical lightweight feasibility for future generation sustainable IoT deployments."}

To address this problem, we propose a robustness evaluation method called scenario domain analysis, which aims to find the expected minimal change in the natural language descriptions of coding tasks that would cause the LLMs to produce incorrect outputs. We have formally proved the theoretical properties of the method and also conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the robustness of four state-of-the-art art LLMs: Gemini-pro, Codex, Llamma2 and Falcon 7B, and have found that we are able to rank these with confidence from best to worst. Moreover, we have also studied how robustness varies in different scenarios, including the variations with the topic of the coding task and with the complexity of its sample solution, and found that robustness is lower for more complex tasks and also lower for more advanced topics, such as multi-threading and data structures."}

These systems were integrated into IVO, a custom mobile social robot equipped with force sensor to detect the force exchange between both agents and LiDAR to detect the environment. The collaborative task required transporting an object over a 5-7 meter distance with obstacles in the middle, demanding rapid decisions and precise physical coordination. 75 volunteers perform a total of 255 executions divided into three groups, testing inference systems in the first round, communication systems in the second, and the combined strategies in the third.

To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG.

We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model.

Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\\% higher correlation and 12--15\\% lower error on average.

We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods."}

To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset.

However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs."}

To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish.

From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization.

The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths.

In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans.

We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis.

This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches."}

Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches."}

Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics.

However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models.

However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines."}

One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss."}

While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture."}

However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions."}

Using logistic regression with repository-clustered standard errors, we find that reviewer engagement has the strongest correlation with successful integration, whereas larger change sizes and coordination-disrupting actions, such as force pushes, are associated with a lower likelihood of merging.

The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings."}

However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task."}

We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance.

Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making."}

Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities."}

Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments."}

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks."}

In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class."}

One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss."}

Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods."}

In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models."}

In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines.

Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs.

Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics."}

However, these governance mechanisms introduce additional computational workloads, including repeated inference, regeneration cycles, and expanded validation pipelines, increasing energy use and the carbon footprint of GenAI-assisted development. This paper proposes Carbon-Aware Governance Gates (CAGG), an architectural extension that embeds carbon budgets, energy provenance, and sustainability-aware validation orchestration into human-AI governance layers.

CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs.

Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\\%, a specificity of 97.2\\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers.

To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture."}

Since MAS coordinate through unstructured natural language rather than rigid protocols, they are prone to semantic failures (e.g., hallucinations, misinterpreted instructions, and reasoning drift) that propagate silently without raising runtime exceptions. Prevailing evaluation approaches, which measure only end-to-end task success, offer limited insight into how these failures arise or how effectively agents recover from them. To bridge this gap, we propose MAS-FIRE, a systematic framework for fault injection and reliability evaluation of MAS. We define a taxonomy of 15 fault types covering intra-agent cognitive errors and inter-agent coordination failures, and inject them via three non-invasive mechanisms: prompt modification, response rewriting, and message routing manipulation. Applying MAS-FIRE to three representative MAS architectures, we uncover a rich set of fault-tolerant behaviors that we organize into four tiers: mechanism, rule, prompt, and reasoning. This tiered view enables fine-grained diagnosis of where and why systems succeed or fail. Our findings reveal that stronger foundation models do not uniformly improve robustness. We further show that architectural topology plays an equally decisive role, with iterative, closed-loop designs neutralizing over 40% of faults that cause catastrophic collapse in linear workflows. MAS-FIRE provides the process-level observability and actionable guidance needed to systematically improve multi-agent systems."}

We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings.

Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment.

We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators."}

We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals.

Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge.

We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints.

Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment.

Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios."}

For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications."}

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner.

Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial.

Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms.

The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data.

However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task."}

We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection."}

Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness.

In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set.

Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks."}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods."}

Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics.

PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing.

To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization.

However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization."}

We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration.

Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions.

To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning.

Although multimodal forecasting has emerged as a viable mitigation strategy, existing architectures predominantly rely on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation, thereby failing to capture the fine-grained optical features of clouds and the complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes M3S-Net, a novel multimodal feature fusion network based on multi-scale data for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, a multi-scale partial channel selection network leverages partial convolutions to explicitly isolate the boundary features of optically thin clouds, effectively transcending the precision limitations of coarse-grained binary masking. Second, a multi-scale sequence to image analysis network employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation to disentangle the complex periodicity of meteorological data across varying time horizons. Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation. Experimental validation on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset demonstrates that M3S-Net achieves a mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos.

However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets. Notably, it demonstrates significant improvements in challenging scenarios, such as objects captured with unseen pose, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise."}

We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data.

Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma.

Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset.

While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net."}

This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality.

Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings."}

Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\\%, 33\\% and 46\\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies.

Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI.

We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment.

LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers."}

We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data.

We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning."}

Both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors of a representative ACM are analyzed. The primary objective is to determine the conditions under which the decoupled model attains accuracy comparable to the coupled model while offering reduced computational cost under identical numerical conditions. The system dynamics are first derived using the Euler--Lagrange method under the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, with explicit treatment of the near-zero curvature singularity. A decoupled model is then obtained by neglecting the coupling terms in the ACM dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of open-loop responses under diverse actuation profiles and external wrenches. To extend the analysis to closed-loop performance, a novel dynamics-based proportional-derivative sliding mode image-based visual servoing (DPD-SM-IBVS) controller is developed for regulating image feature errors in the presence of a moving target. The controller is implemented with both coupled and decoupled models, allowing a direct comparison of their effectiveness. The open-loop simulations reveal pronounced discrepancies between the two modeling approaches, particularly under varying torque inputs and continuum arm parameters. Conversely, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the decoupled model achieves tracking accuracy on par with the coupled model (within subpixel error) while incurring lower computational cost."}

It also requires spectral textures and lights throughout the rendering pipeline. We propose Hadamard spectral codes, a compact latent representation that enables spectral rendering using standard RGB rendering operations. Spectral images are approximated with a small number of RGB rendering passes, followed by a decoding step. Our key requirement is latent linearity: scaling and addition in spectral space correspond to scaling and addition of codes, and the element-wise product of spectra (for example reflectance times illumination) is approximated by the element-wise product of their latent codes. We show that an exact low-dimensional algebra-preserving representation cannot exist for arbitrary spectra when the latent dimension k is smaller than the number of spectral samples n. We therefore introduce a learned non-negative linear encoder and decoder architecture that preserves scaling and addition exactly while encouraging approximate multiplicativity under the Hadamard product. With k = 6, we render k/3 = 2 RGB images per frame using an unmodified RGB renderer, reconstruct the latent image, and decode to high-resolution spectra or XYZ or RGB. Experiments on 3D scenes demonstrate that k = 6 significantly reduces color error compared to RGB baselines while being substantially faster than naive n-sample spectral rendering. Using k = 9 provides higher-quality reference results. We further introduce a lightweight neural upsampling network that maps RGB assets directly to latent codes, enabling integration of legacy RGB content into the spectral pipeline while maintaining perceptually accurate colors in rendered images."}

To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance.

In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy.

However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%."}

The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions.

Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control.
