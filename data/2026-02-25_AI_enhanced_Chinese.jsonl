The existing methods typically use a multi-step pipeline with intermediate representations to decompose the prediction process into several sub-tasks, limiting model flexibility and imposing predefined solution paths. This often results in unreasonable outputs when applied to data unsuitable for these predefined paths, making it challenging for these methods to match human designers, who do not restrict themselves to a specific set of design workflows. To address these limitations, we introduce CE2EPlan, a controllable end-to-end topology- and geometry-enhanced diffusion model that removes restrictions on the generative process of AI design tools. Instead, it enables the model to learn how to design floor plans directly from data, capturing a wide range of solution paths from input boundaries to complete layouts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all existing approaches using the multi-step pipeline, delivering higher-quality results with enhanced user control and greater diversity in output, bringing AI design tools closer to the versatility of human designers.", "AI": {"tldr": "CE2EPlan \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5339\u914d\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 CE2EPlan\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCE2EPlan \u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "CE2EPlan \u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While this lowers barriers to entry, we hypothesize that without pedagogical guardrails, it is fundamentally misaligned with cognitive skill acquisition. Drawing on the distinction between Cognitive Offloading and Cognitive Outsourcing, we argue that unrestricted AI encourages novices to outsource the Intrinsic Cognitive Load required for schema formation, rather than merely offloading Extraneous Load. This accumulation of ``Epistemic Debt\" creates ``Fragile Experts\" whose high functional utility masks critically low corrective competence.\n  To quantify and mitigate this debt, we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=78) using a custom Cursor IDE plugin backed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Participants represented \"AI-Native\" learners across three conditions: Manual (Control), Unrestricted AI (Outsourcing), and Scaffolded AI (Offloading). The Scaffolded condition utilized a novel ``Explanation Gate,\" leveraging a real-time LLM-as-a-Judge framework to enforce a ``Teach-Back\" protocol before generated code could be integrated.\n  Results reveal a ``Collapse of Competence\": while Unrestricted AI users matched the productivity of the Scaffolded group (p < .001 vs. Manual), they suffered a 77% failure rate in a subsequent AI-Blackout maintenance task, compared to only 39% in the Scaffolded group. Qualitative analysis suggests that successful vibe coders naturally engage in self-scaffolding, treating the AI as a consultant rather than a contractor.

Building on this, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), a routine part of electrophysiology procedures, to guide clinicians toward areas of arrhythmogenesis and potentially reduce procedural time. Arrhythmia source localization is formulated as a three-class classification task, distinguishing normal sinus rhythm, left-sided, and right-sided arrhythmias, based on ICE video data. We developed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network trained to discriminate among the three aforementioned classes. In ten-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean accuracy of 66.2% when evaluated on four previously unseen patients (substantially outperforming the 33.3% random baseline). These results demonstrate the feasibility and clinical promise of using ICE videos combined with deep learning for automated arrhythmia localization.

However, existing collaboration paradigms are constrained to message passing, leaving execution environments as isolated silos. This creates a context gap: agents cannot directly manipulate files or invoke tools in a peer's environment, and must instead resort to costly, error-prone environment reconstruction. We introduce the Agent Workspace Collaboration Protocol (AWCP), which bridges this gap through temporary workspace delegation inspired by the Unix philosophy that everything is a file. AWCP decouples a lightweight control plane from pluggable transport mechanisms, allowing a Delegator to project its workspace to a remote Executor, who then operates on the shared files directly with unmodified local toolchains.

Applying a GPU is indispensable for parallel computing; however, the complex data dependencies and resource contention across kernels within a GPU task may unpredictably delay its execution time. To address these problems, this paper presents a scheduling and analysis method for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-structured GPU tasks. Given a DAG representation, the proposed scheduling scales the kernel-level parallelism and establishes inter-kernel dependencies to provide a reduced and predictable DAG response time. The corresponding timing analysis yields a safe yet nonpessimistic makespan bound without any assumption on kernel priorities. The proposed method is implemented using the standard CUDA API, requiring no additional software or hardware support.

It typically comprising a Vision-Language backbone for perception and understanding, together with a generative policy for action generation. However, its performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the action generation proceess. (i) Low inference efficiency. A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard.

A growing bottleneck is transaction execution and validation on the critical path of consensus, which has led to modular decoupled designs that separate ordering from execution: Consensus orders only metadata, while transactions are executed and validated concurrently. While this approach improves performance, it can leave invalid transactions in the ledger, increasing storage costs and enabling new forms of strategic behavior. We present the first systematic study of this setting, providing a formal framework to reason about the interaction between consensus and execution. Using this framework, we show that the decoupled design enables a previously unidentified attack, which we term gaslighting. We prove a fundamental trade-off between resilience to this attack and resource capacity utilization, where both are impossible to achieve deterministically in the decoupled model.

Mimicking the hack mechanism in competitive programming, CodeHacker employs a multi-strategy approach, including stress testing, anti-hash attacks, and logic-specific targeting to break specific code submissions. To ensure the validity and reliability of these attacks, we introduce a Calibration Phase, where the agent iteratively refines its own Validator and Checker via self-generated adversarial probes before evaluating contestant code.Experiments demonstrate that CodeHacker significantly improves the True Negative Rate (TNR) of existing datasets, effectively filtering out incorrect solutions that were previously accepted.

Recent work explores visual token pruning to accelerate inference, while existing pruning methods overlook the underlying distributional structure of visual representations.

By minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between the full and pruned token distributions, OTPrune preserves both local diversity and global representativeness while reducing inference cost. Moreover, we derive a tractable submodular objective that enables efficient optimization, and theoretically prove its monotonicity and submodularity, providing a principled foundation for stable and efficient pruning. We further provide a comprehensive analysis that explains how distributional alignment contributes to stable and semantically faithful pruning.

Firstly, we present an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We then integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques into the BCD method and propose the DRL-based BCD algorithm. This approach combines the data-driven learning capability of machine learning techniques with the navigational and decision-making characteristics of the optimization-theoretic-based BCD method. This combination significantly improves the algorithm's performance by reducing its sensitivity to initial points and mitigating the risk of entrapment in local optima. The primary advantages of the proposed DRL-based BCD algorithm lie in its ability to adhere to the constraints of the WSRM problem and significantly enhance accuracy, potentially achieving the exact optimal solution. Moreover, unlike many pure machine-learning approaches, the DRL-based BCD algorithm capitalizes on the underlying theoretical analysis of the WSRM problem's structure. This enables it to be easily trained and computationally efficient while maintaining a level of interpretability. Through numerical experiments, the DRL-based BCD algorithm demonstrates substantial advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability for maximizing sum rates, which also provides valuable potential for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies in next-generation wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DRL-based BCD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08WSRM\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u603b\u529f\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u70b9\u654f\u611f\u548c\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\uff08BCD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DRL-based BCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDRL-based BCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DRL-based BCD\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5757\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u901f\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684AI\u539f\u751f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Unlike physicians, who can directly manipulate guidewires and integrate tactile feedback with their prior anatomical knowledge, teleoperated robotic systems must rely solely on 2D projections. This mode of operation, simultaneously lacking spatial context and tactile sensation, may give rise to projection-induced ambiguities at vascular bifurcations. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework (SCAR-UNet-GAT) for real-time robotic path planning. In the first stage, SCAR-UNet, a spatial-coordinate-attention-regularized U-Net, is employed for accurate coronary vessel segmentation. The integration of multi-level attention mechanisms enhances the delineation of thin, tortuous vessels and improves robustness against imaging noise. From the resulting binary masks, vessel centerlines and bifurcation points are extracted, and geometric descriptors (e.g., branch diameter, intersection angles) are fused with local DSA patches to construct node features. In the second stage, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) reasons over the vessel graph to identify anatomically consistent and clinically feasible trajectories, effectively distinguishing true bifurcations from projection-induced false crossings.

This essay argues that FLP is not a law of physics but a theorem about a particular system model -- and that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) circumvents it by rejecting the asynchronous model at its foundation. We introduce the term bisynchronous to describe OAE's key property: bounded-time bilateral resolution in which both parties reach common knowledge of outcome at every round boundary -- a strictly stronger guarantee than synchrony alone.

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "RARE-PHENIX\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aefAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8868\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u3001HPO\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u578b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u518d\u5230\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "RARE-PHENIX\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u7684HPO\u672f\u8bed\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cRARE-PHENIX\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387-F1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PhenoBERT\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6dfb\u52a0\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RARE-PHENIX\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0bAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u7f55\u89c1\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

However, scaling beyond 1-WL to 3-WL and higher requires tensor-based operations that scale as O(n^3) or O(n^4), making them computationally prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, Leon, and Gomez, 2018)--a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges--and show that it distinguishes the prism graph from K_{3,3}, a pair that 1-WL provably cannot separate. We then generalize it to Motif-DRESS, which replaces triangle neighborhoods with arbitrary structural motifs and converges to a unique fixed point under three sufficient conditions, and further to Generalized-DRESS, an abstract template parameterized by the choice of neighborhood operator, aggregation function and norm. Finally, we introduce Delta-DRESS, which runs DRESS on each node-deleted subgraph G\\{v}, connecting the framework to the Kelly-Ulam reconstruction conjecture. Both Motif-DRESS and Delta-DRESS empirically distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs (SRGs)--such as the Rook and Shrikhande graphs--that confound 3-WL.

Rule-based visualization linters can flag violations, but they miss context and do not suggest meaningful design changes. Directly querying general-purpose LLMs about visualization quality is unreliable: lacking training to follow visualization design principles, they often produce inconsistent or incorrect feedback. In this work, we introduce a framework that combines chart de-rendering, automated analysis, and iterative improvement to deliver actionable, interpretable feedback on visualization design. Our system reconstructs the structure of a chart from an image, identifies design flaws using vision-language reasoning, and proposes concrete modifications supported by established principles in visualization research.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for autonomous catheter steering; however, conventional methods suffer from sparse reward design and reliance on static vascular models, limiting their sample efficiency and generalization to intraoperative variations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a sample-efficient RL framework with online expert correction for autonomous catheter steering in endovascular bifurcation navigation. The proposed framework integrates three key components: (1) A segmentation-based pose estimation module for accurate real-time state feedback, (2) A fuzzy controller for bifurcation-aware orientation adjustment, and (3) A structured reward generator incorporating expert priors to guide policy learning. By leveraging online expert correction, the framework reduces exploration inefficiency and enhances policy robustness in complex vascular structures. Experimental validation on a robotic platform using a transparent vascular phantom demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves convergence in 123 training episodes -- a 25.9% reduction compared to the baseline Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm -- while reducing average positional error to 83.8% of the baseline. These results indicate that combining sample-efficient RL with online expert correction enables reliable and accurate catheter steering, particularly in anatomically challenging bifurcation scenarios critical for endovascular navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8840\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u672f\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u53c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728123\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5468\u671f\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u6536\u655b\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfSAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1125.9%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u768483.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5206\u53c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, these updates neither accurately represent a client's heterogeneity nor are their selection methods deterministic. We mitigate these limitations by introducing Terraform, a novel client selection methodology that uses gradient updates and a deterministic selection algorithm to select heterogeneous clients for retraining.

In Phase I, a large language model proposes a sparse draft DAG, serving as a semantically informed prior over the space of possible causal structures. In Phase II, this draft is audited and refined via conditional independence testing, with detected discrepancies guiding targeted edge revisions.\n  We evaluate our approach on three metadata-rich real-world benchmarks spanning industrial engineering, environmental monitoring, and IT systems analysis. Across these datasets, DMCD achieves competitive or leading performance against diverse causal discovery baselines, with particularly large gains in recall and F1 score.

While robust algorithms exist for insertion-only streams with only a polylogarithmic overhead in memory over non-robust algorithms, it was widely conjectured that turnstile streams of length polynomial in the universe size $n$ require space linear in $n$. We refute this conjecture, showing that robustness can be achieved using space which is significantly sublinear in $n$. Our framework combines multiple linear sketches in a novel estimator-corrector-learner framework, yielding the first insertion-deletion algorithms that approximate: (1) the second moment $F_2$ up to a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-factor in polylogarithmic space, (2) any symmetric function $\\cal{F}$ with an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximate triangle inequality up to a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(C)}$ factor in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{1/C}) \\cdot S(n)$ bits of space, where $S$ is the space required to approximate $\\cal{F}$ non-robustly; this includes a broad class of functions such as the $L_1$-norm, the support size $F_0$, and non-normed losses such as the $M$-estimators, and (3) $L_2$ heavy hitters. For the $F_2$ moment, our algorithm is optimal up to $\\textrm{poly}((\\log n)/\\varepsilon)$ factors. Given the recent results of Gribelyuk et al.

In clinical documentation, vendor claims of multi-minute time savings contrast with measured reductions of less than one minute per note, and one widely deployed tool showed no statistically significant effect.

Unlike prior neural mesh compression methods that treat each mesh frame independently, N4MC takes inspiration from inter-frame compression in 2D video codecs, and learns motion compensation in long mesh sequences. Specifically, N4MC converts consecutive irregular mesh frames into regular 4D tensors to provide a uniform and compact representation. These tensors are then condensed using an auto-decoder, which captures both spatial and temporal correlations for redundancy removal. To enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a transformer-based interpolation model that predicts intermediate mesh frames conditioned on latent embeddings derived from tracked volume centers, eliminating motion ambiguities.

As parallelism increases, scheduling overhead may transition from negligible to dominant, leading to rapid drops in performance for some algorithms, while remaining negligible for others. Although such effects are widely observed empirically, there is a general lack of understanding how algorithmic structure impacts whether dynamic scheduling is always beneficial. In this work, we introduce a granularity characterization framework that directly links scheduling overhead growth to task-graph dependency topology. We show that dependency structure, rather than problem size alone, governs how overhead scales with parallelism. Based on this observation, we characterize execution behavior using a simple granularity measure that indicates when scheduling overhead can be amortized by parallel computation and when scheduling overhead dominates performance. Through experimental evaluation on representative parallel workloads with diverse dependency patterns, we demonstrate that the proposed characterization explains both gradual and abrupt strong-scaling breakdowns observed in practice. We further show that overhead models derived from dependency topology accurately predict strong-scaling limits and enable a practical runtime decision rule for selecting dynamic or static execution without requiring exhaustive strong-scaling studies or extensive offline tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u62d3\u6251\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u5d29\u6e83\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5e76\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7c92\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u548c\u7a81\u7136\u7684\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u95ee\u9898\u5927\u5c0f\u672c\u8eab\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f00\u9500\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u5e76\u884c\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u5f81\u6267\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6307\u793a\u4f55\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u644a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u5f00\u9500\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u9759\u6001\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\u6216\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

These robots often incorporate deep learning (DL) components into their software to support functionality such as perception, decision-making, and control, enhancing autonomy and self-adaptability. However, the inherent uncertainty of DL-enabled software makes it challenging to ensure its dependability in dynamic environments. Consequently, test generation techniques have been developed to test robot software, and classical mutation analysis injects faults into the software to assess the test suite's effectiveness in detecting the resulting failures. However, there is a lack of mutation analysis techniques to assess the effectiveness under the uncertainty inherent to DL-enabled software. To this end, we propose UAMTERS, an uncertainty-aware mutation analysis framework that introduces uncertainty-aware mutation operators to explicitly inject stochastic uncertainty into DL-enabled robotic software, simulating uncertainty in its behavior. We further propose mutation score metrics to quantify a test suite's ability to detect failures under varying levels of uncertainty. We evaluate UAMTERS across three robotic case studies, demonstrating that UAMTERS more effectively distinguishes test suite quality and captures uncertainty-induced failures in DL-enabled software.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAMTERS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30DL-enabled\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "DL-enabled\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UAMTERS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cf\u5316DL-enabled\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cUAMTERS\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "UAMTERS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9DL-enabled\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSNR\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5e73\u6ed1\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5148\u9a8c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ea6\u675f\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGraph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6784\u9020\u9650\u5236\u5728\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u5206\u91cf\u65bd\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56db\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cGSNR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe4.3 dB\uff0c\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe1 dB\uff08\u4ee5PSNR\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GSNR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u5e73\u6ed1\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Trajectory representations are parameterized as linear combinations of orthogonal basis functions, and optimization is performed directly in the coefficient space. The constrained problem formulation consists of both an objective functional and a finite-dimensional objective defined over truncated coefficients. To address nonlinearity, FACTO uses a Gauss-Newton approximation with exponential moving averaging, yielding a smoothed quadratic subproblem. Trajectory-wide constraints are addressed using coefficient-space mappings, and an adaptive constrained update using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is performed in the null space of active constraints. Comparisons with optimization-based planners (CHOMP, TrajOpt, GPMP2) and sampling-based planners (RRT-Connect, RRT*, PRM) show the improved solution quality and feasibility, especially in constrained single- and multi-arm scenarios.

While originally developed for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, previous work established the theory and algorithms for unstructured meshes of simplicial and prismatic elements. To harness the full potential of tree-based AMR for three-dimensional mixed-element meshes, this paper introduces the pyramid as a new functional element type; its primary purpose is to connect tetrahedral and hexahedral elements without hanging edges.We present a well-defined space-filling curve (SFC) for the pyramid and detail how the unique challenges on the element and forest level associated with the pyramidal refinement are resolved. We propose the necessary functional design and generalize the fundamental global parallel algorithms for refinement, coarsening, partitioning, and face ghost exchange to fully support this new element.

While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools.

However, their integration into end-to-end UAV-based reconstruction and visualization systems remains underexplored.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive visual fidelity, while delivering significantly higher rendering performance and substantially reduced end-to-end latency, compared to NeRF-based approaches.

However, latent actions derived solely from RGB observations primarily encode appearance-driven dynamics and lack explicit 3D geometric structure, which is essential for precise and contact-rich manipulation. To address this limitation, we introduce UniLACT, a transformer-based VLA model that incorporates geometric structure through depth-aware latent pretraining, enabling downstream policies to inherit stronger spatial priors. To facilitate this process, we propose UniLARN, a unified latent action learning framework based on inverse and forward dynamics objectives that learns a shared embedding space for RGB and depth while explicitly modeling their cross-modal interactions. This formulation produces modality-specific and unified latent action representations that serve as pseudo-labels for the depth-aware pretraining of UniLACT. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-aware unified latent action representations. UniLACT consistently outperforms RGB-based latent action baselines under in-domain and out-of-domain pretraining regimes, as well as on both seen and unseen manipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniLACT\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eRGB\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u89c2\u5bdf\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "UniLACT\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UniLARN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u5411\u548c\u6b63\u5411\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60RGB\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "UniLACT\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5df2\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "UniLACT\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Such a capability could help researchers identify collaborators and impactful research directions, and anticipate which problems and methods will become central next. We introduce PreScience -- a scientific forecasting benchmark that decomposes the research process into four interdependent generative tasks: collaborator prediction, prior work selection, contribution generation, and impact prediction. PreScience is a carefully curated dataset of 98K recent AI-related research papers, featuring disambiguated author identities, temporally aligned scholarly metadata, and a structured graph of companion author publication histories and citations spanning 502K total papers.

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $\u03b2$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $\u03b2= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $\u03b2= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $\u03b2$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.\n  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "OAG\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DTB\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u9760\uff08\u03b2=0\uff09\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff08\u03b2=1\uff09\u65f6\u5747\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf7\u6c42-\u56de\u7b54\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0cOAG\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u6536\u6765\u81ea\u95ee\u9898\u7b54\u6848\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165DTB\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "DTB\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u5728\u7ebf\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u524d\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OAG\u6a21\u578b\u548cDTB\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002"}}

An important bottleneck faced by existing differentiable simulation frameworks is contact manifold generation: representing the volume of intersection between two colliding geometries via a discrete set of properly distributed contact points. A major factor contributing to this bottleneck is that the related routines of commonly used robotics simulators were not designed with vectorization and differentiability as a primary concern, and thus rely on logic and control flow that hinder these goals. We instead propose a framework designed from the ground up with these goals in mind, by trying to strike a middle ground between: i) convex primitive based approaches used by common robotics simulators (efficient but not differentiable), and ii) mollified vertex-face and edge-edge unsigned distance-based approaches used by barrier methods (differentiable but inefficient). Concretely, we propose: i) a representative set of smooth analytical signed distance primitives to implement vertex-face collisions, and ii) a novel differentiable edge-edge collision routine that can provide signed distances and signed contact normals. The proposed framework is evaluated via a set of didactic experiments and benchmarked against the collision detection routine of the well-established Mujoco XLA framework, where we observe a significant speedup.

Unlike earlier approaches such as ScenicNL and LCTGen (which generate scenarios directly from text) or TARGET (which uses deterministic mappings from traffic rules), our method introduces an intermediate Scenic DSL layer to separate high-level semantic understanding from low-level scenario rendering, reducing errors and capturing real-world variability. We evaluated the pipeline on cases from the NHTSA CIREN database. The results show high accuracy in knowledge extraction: 100% correctness for environmental and road network attributes, and 97% and 98% for oracle and actor trajectories, respectively, compared to human-derived ground truth. We executed the generated scenarios in the CARLA simulator using the Autoware driving stack, and they consistently triggered the intended traffic-rule violations (such as opposite-lane crossing and red-light running) across 2,000 scenario variations.

Allen"], "title": "3DSPA: A 3D Semantic Point Autoencoder for Evaluating Video Realism", "comment": null, "summary": "AI video generation is evolving rapidly. For video generators to be useful for applications ranging from robotics to film-making, they must consistently produce realistic videos. However, evaluating the realism of generated videos remains a largely manual process -- requiring human annotation or bespoke evaluation datasets which have restricted scope. Here we develop an automated evaluation framework for video realism which captures both semantics and coherent 3D structure and which does not require access to a reference video. Our method, 3DSPA, is a 3D spatiotemporal point autoencoder which integrates 3D point trajectories, depth cues, and DINO semantic features into a unified representation for video evaluation. 3DSPA models how objects move and what is happening in the scene, enabling robust assessments of realism, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments show that 3DSPA reliably identifies videos which violate physical laws, is more sensitive to motion artifacts, and aligns more closely with human judgments of video quality and realism across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that enriching trajectory-based representations with 3D semantics offers a stronger foundation for benchmarking generative video models, and implicitly captures physical rule violations.

Vision-language model (VLM) planners can reason about friction and stability in general terms; however, they often cannot predict how a specific ball will roll on a particular surface or which stone will provide a stable foundation without direct experience. We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones.

Yet in deployment, their inference performance is often bounded by the memory capacity, bandwidth, and latency limits of a single GPU, making multi-GPU execution increasingly necessary. Although tensor parallelism (TP) is widely used to scale Transformer inference, applying it to selective SSM blocks is non-trivial because the SSM mixer couples large projections with a sequence-wise recurrent state update and local mixing whose efficiency depends on preserving locality and avoiding synchronization in the critical path.\n  This paper presents a communication-efficient TP design for selective SSM inference that addresses three practical engineering challenges: enabling TTFT improvements via an SSM state cache across prefill and decode, partitioning the mixer's packed parameter tensor so that recurrent updates remain local while minimizing communication, and reducing TP aggregation overhead with quantized AllReduce. We evaluate on three representative SSM-based LLMs spanning pure-SSM and hybrid architectures - Mamba, Falcon-Mamba, and Zamba - on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 clusters. Our experiments show substantial throughput gains from tensor-parallel SSM inference, improving batch-request throughput by ~1.6-2.1x on 2 GPUs and ~2.6-4.0x on 4 GPUs for Mamba, with the largest benefits at long context lengths, and achieving a further ~10-18% throughput improvement from quantized all-reduce by lowering synchronization bandwidth overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591aGPU\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\u63a8\u7406TP\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u533a\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5355GPU\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u9700\u591aGPU\u6267\u884c\u3002\u73b0\u6709TP\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSSM\u5757\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u8026\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684TP\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ecSSM\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u533a\u548c\u91cf\u5316AllReduce\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\u5757\u5728TP\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57282\u548c4 GPU\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.6-2.1\u500d\u548c2.6-4.0\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u91cf\u5316AllReduce\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610-18%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1TP\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SSM\u72b6\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u533a\u548c\u91cf\u5316AllReduce\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591aGPU\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Agile V addresses this gap by embedding independent verification and audit artifact generation into each task cycle. The framework merges Agile iteration with V-Model verification into a continuous Infinity Loop, deploying specialized AI agents for requirements, design, build, test, and compliance, governed by mandatory human approval gates. We evaluate three hypotheses: (H1) audit-ready artifacts emerge as a by-product of development, (H2) 100% requirement-level verification is achievable with independent test generation, and (H3) verified increments can be delivered with single-digit human interactions per cycle. A feasibility case study on a Hardware-in-the-Loop system (about 500 LOC, 8 requirements, 54 tests) supports all three hypotheses: audit-ready documentation was generated automatically (H1), 100% requirement-level pass rate was achieved (H2), and only 6 prompts per cycle were required (H3), yielding an estimated 10-50x cost reduction versus a COCOMO II baseline (sensitivity range from pessimistic to optimistic assumptions).

Existing approaches for aesthetic viewpoint suggestion are either single-view adjustments, predicting limited camera adjustments from a single image without understanding scene geometry, or 3D exploration approaches, which rely on dense captures or prebuilt 3D environments coupled with costly reinforcement learning (RL) searches. In this work, we introduce the notion of 3D aesthetic field that enables geometry-grounded aesthetic reasoning in 3D with sparse captures, allowing efficient viewpoint suggestions in contrast to costly RL searches. We opt to learn this 3D aesthetic field using a feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting network that distills high-level aesthetic knowledge from a pretrained 2D aesthetic model into 3D space, enabling aesthetic prediction for novel viewpoints from only sparse input views. Building on this field, we propose a two-stage search pipeline that combines coarse viewpoint sampling with gradient-based refinement, efficiently identifying aesthetically appealing viewpoints without dense captures or RL exploration.

To mitigate injury risks, energy-constraining control approaches are commonly used, often relying on safety thresholds derived from blunt impact data in EN ISO 10218-2:2025. However, this dataset does not extend to edged or pointed collisions. Without scalable, clinically grounded datasets covering diverse contact scenarios, safety validation remains limited. Previous studies have laid the groundwork by assessing surrogate-based velocity and mass limits across various geometries, focusing on perpendicular impacts. This study expands those datasets by including shearing contact scenarios in unconstrained collisions, revealing that collision angle significantly affects injury outcomes. Notably, unconstrained shearing contacts result in fewer injuries than perpendicular ones. By reevaluating all prior porcine surrogate data, we establish energy thresholds across geometries and contact types, forming the first energy-based Injury Protection Database.

The theorem is correct within its standard asynchronous network model, but operational practice depends on where partition-like phenomena become observable and on how lower layers discard or preserve semantic information about message fate. This paper argues that Open Atomic Ethernet (OAE) shifts the engineering regime in which CAP tradeoffs become application-visible by (i) replacing fire-and-forget link semantics with bounded-time bilateral reconciliation of endpoint state -- the property we call bisynchrony -- and (ii) avoiding Clos funnel points via an octavalent mesh in which each node can act as the root of a locally repaired spanning tree. The result is not the elimination of hard graph cuts, but a drastic reduction in the frequency and duration of application-visible \"soft partitions\" by detecting and healing dominant fabric faults within hundreds of nanoseconds.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations.

However, in dependency recommendation scenarios, the reliability of LLMs is undermined by widespread package hallucinations, where models often recommend hallucinated packages. Recent studies have proposed a range of approaches to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, existing approaches typically merely reduce hallucination rates rather than eliminate them, leaving persistent software security risks.\n  In this work, we argue that package hallucinations are theoretically preventable based on the key insight that package validity is decidable through finite and enumerable authoritative package lists. Building on this, we propose PackMonitor, the first approach capable of fundamentally eliminating package hallucinations by continuously monitoring the model's decoding process and intervening when necessary. To implement this in practice, PackMonitor addresses three key challenges: (1) determining when to trigger intervention via a Context-Aware Parser that continuously monitors model outputs and selectively activates intervening only during installation command generation; (2) resolving how to intervene by employing a Package-Name Intervenor that strictly limits the decoding space to an authoritative package list; and (3) ensuring monitoring efficiency through a DFA-Caching Mechanism that enables scalability to millions of packages with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments on five widely used LLMs demonstrate that PackMonitor is a training-free, plug-and-play solution that consistently reduces package hallucination rates to zero while maintaining low-latency inference and preserving original model capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "PackMonitor\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5e72\u9884LLM\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u635f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u975e\u6d88\u9664\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "PackMonitor\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u5305\u540d\u5e72\u9884\u5668\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u6743\u5a01\u5305\u5217\u8868\u3001DFA\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u76d1\u63a7\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLM\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPackMonitor\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u5c06\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u96f6\u3002", "conclusion": "PackMonitor\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5305\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u81f3\u96f6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet, these models remain fragile under domain shifts, especially when adapting from synthetic to real-world point clouds. Conventional 3D domain adaptation approaches rely on heavy trainable encoders, yielding strong accuracy but at the cost of efficiency. We introduce CLIPoint3D, the first framework for few-shot unsupervised 3D point cloud domain adaptation built upon CLIP. Our approach projects 3D samples into multiple depth maps and exploits the frozen CLIP backbone, refined through a knowledge-driven prompt tuning scheme that integrates high-level language priors with geometric cues from a lightweight 3D encoder. To adapt task-specific features effectively, we apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning to CLIP's encoders and design an entropy-guided view sampling strategy for selecting confident projections. Furthermore, an optimal transport-based alignment loss and an uncertainty-aware prototype alignment loss collaboratively bridge source-target distribution gaps while maintaining class separability. Extensive experiments on PointDA-10 and GraspNetPC-10 benchmarks show that CLIPoint3D achieves consistent 3-16% accuracy gains over both CLIP-based and conventional encoder-based baselines.

We introduce a unified multi-task RL framework that bridges this gap by treating reference motion as a prior for behavioral shaping rather than a deployment-time constraint. A single goal-conditioned policy is trained jointly on two tasks that share the same observation and action spaces, but differ in their initialization schemes, command spaces, and reward structures: (i) a reference-guided imitation task in which reference trajectories define dense imitation rewards but are not provided as policy inputs, and (ii) a goal-conditioned generalization task in which goals are sampled independently of any reference and where rewards reflect only task success. By co-optimizing these objectives within a shared formulation, the policy acquires structured, human-like motor skills from dense reference supervision while learning to adapt these skills to novel goals and initial conditions. This is achieved without adversarial objectives, explicit trajectory tracking, phase variables, or reference-dependent inference. We evaluate the method on a challenging box-based parkour playground that demands diverse athletic behaviors (e.g., jumping and climbing), and show that the learned controller transfers beyond the reference distribution while preserving motion naturalness.

Although inference-time augmentation techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can partially mitigate hallucinations, knowledge injection through prompting alone is insufficient to enable models to fully understand the intrinsic relationships among different components of a codebase, or to reason about the correct compositions and apply. Although explicit knowledge injection can be achieved through post-training, compared with public code domains, unseen codebases typically provide only source code and lack large volumes of high-quality, usage-oriented code that can be directly leveraged as training data. Consequently, existing data synthesis approaches are insufficient to adequately capture unseen codebases usage scenarios when restricted to source code alone. To address these challenges, we propose UCD-Training, a two-stage training framework for reasoning-aware data synthesis grounded in a code graph constructed from unseen codebases. UCD-Training first parses the source code to build a code graph, then conducts dependency-preserving continued pretraining (CPT) using file-level dependency data, followed by graph-grounded supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on three types of synthesized data augmented with explicit reasoning traces: (1) single-hop relation reasoning data, (2) compositional API reasoning data, and (3) codebase utilization data.

Recent works have shown that most state-of-the-art fake image detection methods overfit to their training data and catastrophically fail when evaluated on curated hard test sets with strong distribution shifts. In this work, we argue that it is more principled to learn a tight decision boundary around the real image distribution and treat the fake category as a sink class. To this end, we propose SimLBR, a simple and efficient framework for fake image detection using Latent Blending Regularization (LBR). Our method significantly improves cross-generator generalization, achieving up to +24.85\\% accuracy and +69.62\\% recall on the challenging Chameleon benchmark. SimLBR is also highly efficient, training orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Our method synthesizes robust grasp configurations informed by human demonstrations and employs an adaptive controller that residually issues joint corrections to prevent in-hand slip while tracking the object trajectory. Grasp-to-Act enables robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across five dynamic tool-use tasks--hammering, sawing, cutting, stirring, and scooping--consistently outperforming baselines.

This approach conflates two distinct steps in causal analysis: identification-formulating a valid research design under stated assumptions-and estimation-implementing that design numerically on finite data. We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation.

To this end, this paper outlines the creation of an Agentic Infused Software Ecosystem (AISE), that rests on three pillars. The first, of course, is the AI agents themselves, which in the past 5 years have moved from simple code completion and toward sophisticated independent development tasks, a trend which will only continue. The second pillar is the programming language and APIs (or tools) that these agents use to accomplish tasks, and increasingly, serve as the communication substrate that humans and AI agents interact and collaborate through. The final pillar is the runtime environment and ecosystem that agents operate within, and which provide the capabilities that programmatic agents use to interface with (and effect actions in) the external world.

Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors promise high-quality imaging in regimes where conventional cameras fail, but raw \\emph{quanta frames} contain only sparse, noisy, binary photon detections. Recovering a coherent image from a burst of such frames requires handling alignment, denoising, and demosaicing (for color) under noise statistics far outside those assumed by standard restoration pipelines or modern generative models. We present an approach that adapts large text-to-image latent diffusion models to the photon-limited domain of quanta burst imaging. Our method leverages the structural and semantic priors of internet-scale diffusion models while introducing mechanisms to handle Bernoulli photon statistics. By integrating latent-space restoration with burst-level spatio-temporal reasoning, our approach produces reconstructions that are both photometrically faithful and perceptually pleasing, even under high-speed motion. We evaluate the method on synthetic benchmarks and new real-world datasets, including the first color SPAD burst dataset and a challenging \\textit{Deforming (XD)} video benchmark. Across all settings, the approach substantially improves perceptual quality over classical and modern learning-based baselines, demonstrating the promise of adapting large generative priors to extreme photon-limited sensing.

Mining these graphs yields a compact set of reusable camera-handling strategy primitives, which provide structured supervision for learning.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6613\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u8bca\u65ad\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548cLorenz\u6df7\u6c8c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u800c\u975e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u5438\u5f15\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong cross-modal representations, their potential for dense, text-guided medical image segmentation remains underexplored.

Our approach leverages patch-level CLIP embeddings through probabilistic cross-modal attention, enabling bidirectional interaction between image and text tokens and explicit modeling of predictive uncertainty. Together with a soft patch-level contrastive loss that encourages more nuanced semantic learning across diverse textual prompts, MedCLIPSeg effectively improves data efficiency and domain generalizability. Extensive experiments across 16 datasets spanning five imaging modalities and six organs demonstrate that MedCLIPSeg outperforms prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps that highlight local reliability of segmentation results.

A safety case sketch across collusion strategies", "comment": "66 pages, 14 figures, Preprint", "summary": "AIs are increasingly being deployed with greater autonomy and capabilities, which increases the risk that a misaligned AI may be able to cause catastrophic harm. Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies.

While existing clinical decision support systems support clinical practice, there remains a need for proactive, reliability-oriented methodologies capable of identifying and mitigating failure scenarios before patient safety is compromised. This paper presents M-GENGAR, a methodology based on a closed-loop Digital Twin (DT) paradigm for dependability assurance of medical CPSs. The approach combines Stochastic Hybrid Automata modeling, data-driven learning of patient dynamics, and Statistical Model Checking with an offline critical scenario detection phase that integrates model-space exploration and diversity analysis to systematically identify and classify scenarios violating expert-defined dependability requirements. M-GENGAR also supports the automated synthesis of mitigation strategies, enabling runtime feedback and control within the DT loop. We evaluate M-GENGAR on a representative use case study involving a pulmonary ventilator.

We propose SceMoS, a scene-aware motion synthesis framework that shows that structured 2D scene representations can serve as a powerful alternative to full 3D supervision in physically grounded motion synthesis. SceMoS disentangles global planning from local execution using lightweight 2D cues and relying on (1) a text-conditioned autoregressive global motion planner that operates on a bird's-eye-view (BEV) image rendered from an elevated corner of the scene, encoded with DINOv2 features, as the scene representation, and (2) a geometry-grounded motion tokenizer trained via a conditional VQ-VAE, that uses 2D local scene heightmap, thus embedding surface physics directly into a discrete vocabulary. This 2D factorization reaches an efficiency-fidelity trade-off: BEV semantics capture spatial layout and affordance for global reasoning, while local heightmaps enforce fine-grained physical adherence without full 3D volumetric reasoning.

However, the substantial increase in visual tokens, particularly from multi-view inputs, poses serious challenges to real-time robotic manipulation. Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the \u03c00 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "BFA++\u662f\u9488\u5bf9VLA\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\uff09\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BFA++\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1a\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7a81\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728RoboTwin\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cBFA++\u5728\u03c00\u548cRDT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.8\u500d\u548c1.5\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea610%\u3002", "conclusion": "BFA++\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

In these experiments, the model's ability to effectively measure the analyzability of quantum algorithms is assessed, and the relationship between the analyzability levels computed by the model and the participant's perceptions of the complexity of these algorithms is examined.

However, we argue that Euclidean-based FM overlooks fundamental limitations of flat geometry, where polynomial volume growth fails to accommodate diverse feature distributions, leading to severe path entanglement. To this end, we propose path-decoupled Hyperbolic Flow Matching (HFM), leveraging the Lorentz manifold's exponential expansion for trajectory decoupling. HFM structures the transport via two key designs: 1) Centripetal hyperbolic alignment: It constructs a centripetal hierarchy by anchoring textual roots, which pushes visual leaves to the boundary to initialize orderly flows. 2) Path-decoupled objective: It acts as a ``semantic guardrail'' rigidly confining trajectories within isolated class-specific geodesic corridors via step-wise supervision. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive diameter-based stopping to prevent over-transportation into the crowded origin based on the intrinsic semantic scale.

In contrast, robotic grinding systems typically rely on force sensing, with acoustic information largely ignored. This reliance on force sensors is costly and difficult to adapt to different grinding tools, whereas audio sensors (microphones) are low-cost and can be mounted on any medium that conducts grinding sound.\n  This paper introduces a low-cost Acoustic Feedback Robotic Grinding System (AFRG) that captures audio signals with a contact microphone, estimates grinding force from the audio in real time, and enables closed-loop force control of the grinding process. Compared with conventional force-sensing approaches, AFRG achieves a 4-fold improvement in consistency across different grinding disc conditions. AFRG relies solely on a low-cost microphone, which is approximately 200-fold cheaper than conventional force sensors, as the sensing modality, providing an easily deployable, cost-effective robotic grinding solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "AFRG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u5b9e\u73b0\u78e8\u524a\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u78e8\u524a\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u529b\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u78e8\u524a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u800c\u97f3\u9891\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\uff09\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u5b89\u88c5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u4f20\u5bfc\u78e8\u524a\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "AFRG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u6355\u83b7\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u78e8\u524a\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u78e8\u524a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAFRG\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u78e8\u76d8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76841/200\u3002", "conclusion": "AFRG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u529b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u529b\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u78e8\u76d8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864\u500d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u78e8\u524a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to \u03c00.

MIPCandy provides a complete, modular pipeline spanning data loading, training, inference, and evaluation, allowing researchers to obtain a fully functional process workflow by implementing a single method, $\\texttt{build_network}$, while retaining fine-grained control over every component. Central to the design is $\\texttt{LayerT}$, a deferred configuration mechanism that enables runtime substitution of convolution, normalization, and activation modules without subclassing. The framework further offers built-in $k$-fold cross-validation, dataset inspection with automatic region-of-interest detection, deep supervision, exponential moving average, multi-frontend experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, Notion, MLflow), training state recovery, and validation score prediction via quotient regression. An extensible bundle ecosystem provides pre-built model implementations that follow a consistent trainer--predictor pattern and integrate with the core framework without modification.

However, the high computational demands of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) pose a significant challenge to their practical deployment. While feature caching is a promising acceleration strategy, existing methods based on simple reusing or training-free forecasting struggle to adapt to the complex, stage-dependent dynamics of the diffusion process, often resulting in quality degradation and failing to maintain consistency with the standard denoising process. To address this, we propose a LEarnable Stage-Aware (LESA) predictor framework based on two-stage training. Our approach leverages a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to accurately learn temporal feature mappings from data. We further introduce a multi-stage, multi-expert architecture that assigns specialized predictors to different noise-level stages, enabling more precise and robust feature forecasting. Extensive experiments show our method achieves significant acceleration while maintaining high-fidelity generation. Experiments demonstrate 5.00x acceleration on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality degradation (1.0% drop), 6.25x speedup on Qwen-Image with a 20.2% quality improvement over the previous SOTA (TaylorSeer), and 5.00x acceleration on HunyuanVideo with a 24.7% PSNR improvement over TaylorSeer.

To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models.

Finally, we construct a three-stage RL system comprising SFT, Offline RL, and Human-in-the-Loop RL for fine-tuning VLA models. Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%).

We argue that this understanding hinges on two complementary capacities: geometric perception, which identifies the structural parts of objects that enable interaction, and interaction perception, which models how an agent's actions engage with those parts. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a systematic probing of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We find that models like DINO inherently encode part-level geometric structures, while generative models like Flux contain rich, verb-conditioned spatial attention maps that serve as implicit interaction priors. Crucially, we demonstrate that these two dimensions are not merely correlated but are composable elements of affordance. By simply fusing DINO's geometric prototypes with Flux's interaction maps in a training-free and zero-shot manner, we achieve affordance estimation competitive with weakly-supervised methods.

This publication presents a robotic system for collecting open-path measurements, making use of a sensor mounted on a ground-based pan-tilt unit and a small drone carrying a reflector.

However, most existing alignment approaches operate at training time and rely on additional high-quality data, incurring significant computational and annotation costs. While recent work has shown that contrastive decoding can leverage a model's internal distributions to improve specific capabilities, its applicability remains limited to narrow behavioral scopes and scenarios. In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the \"3H\" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding.

Despite significant advances in segmentation accuracy, the black-box nature of most deep models has raised growing concerns about their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical scenarios. Current explanation techniques have primarily focused on classification tasks, leaving the segmentation domain relatively underexplored. We introduced an explanation model for segmentation task which employs the causal inference framework and backpropagates the average treatment effect (ATE) into a quantification metric to determine the influence of input regions, as well as network components, on target segmentation areas. Through comparison with recent segmentation explainability techniques on two representative medical imaging datasets, we demonstrated that our approach provides more faithful explanations than existing approaches.

While existing research has explored methods to select footholds based on terrain geometry or kinematics, a critical gap remains: few existing methods efficiently validate the existence of a non-collision swing trajectory. This paper addresses this gap by introducing KCFRC, a novel approach for efficient foothold reachability analysis. We first formally define the foothold reachability problem and establish a sufficient condition for foothold reachability. Based on this condition, we develop the KCFRC algorithm, which enables robots to validate foothold reachability in real time. Our experimental results demonstrate that KCFRC achieves remarkable time efficiency, completing foothold reachability checks for a single leg across 900 potential footholds in an average of 2 ms. Furthermore, we show that KCFRC can accelerate trajectory optimization and is particularly beneficial for contact planning in confined spaces, enhancing the adaptability and robustness of legged robots in challenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "KCFRC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8db3\u90e8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u57282\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1900\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u8db3\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8db3\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u6446\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8db3\u90e8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8db3\u90e8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86KCFRC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u8db3\u90e8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKCFRC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u817f\u5bf9900\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u8db3\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u97002\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "KCFRC\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8db3\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8db3\u90e8\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, previous methods are severely limited by treating each transfer as an isolated endeavor, demanding repeated, costly tuning and wasting prior transfer experience.To move beyond isolated sim-to-real, we build a continual cross-task sim-to-real transfer paradigm centered on knowledge accumulation across iterative transfers, thereby enabling effective and efficient adaptation to novel tasks. Thus, we propose GeCo-SRT, a geometry-aware continual adaptation method. It utilizes domain-invariant and task-invariant knowledge from local geometric features as a transferable foundation to accelerate adaptation during subsequent sim-to-real transfers. This method starts with a geometry-aware mixture-of-experts module, which dynamically activates experts to specialize in distinct geometric knowledge to bridge observation sim-to-real gap. Further, the geometry-expert-guided prioritized experience replay module preferentially samples from underutilized experts, refreshing specialized knowledge to combat forgetting and maintain robust cross-task performance. Leveraging knowledge accumulated during iterative transfer, GeCo-SRT method not only achieves 52% average performance improvement over the baseline, but also demonstrates significant data efficiency for new task adaptation with only 1/6 data.We hope this work inspires approaches for efficient, low-cost cross-task sim-to-real transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeCo-SRT\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534752%\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c11\u81f31/6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6bcf\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u6d6a\u8d39\u5148\u524d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "GeCo-SRT\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "GeCo-SRT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534752%\uff0c\u4e14\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u4ec5\u97001/6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GeCo-SRT\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534752%\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u97001/6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing defenses typically rely on strict filtering or refusal mechanisms, which suffer from a critical limitation: over-refusal, prematurely terminating valid agentic workflows. We propose ICON, a probing-to-mitigation framework that neutralizes attacks while preserving task continuity. Our key insight is that IPI attacks leave distinct over-focusing signatures in the latent space. We introduce a Latent Space Trace Prober to detect attacks based on high intensity scores.

However, existing app rating prediction models are largely limited to textual data or user interface (UI) features, overlooking the importance of jointly leveraging UI and semantic information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a lightweight vision--language framework that integrates both mobile UI and semantic information for app rating prediction. The framework combines MobileNetV3 to extract visual features from UI layouts and DistilBERT to extract textual features. These multimodal features are fused through a gated fusion module with Swish activations, followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression head. The proposed model is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Pearson correlation. After training for 20 epochs, the model achieves an MAE of 0.1060, an RMSE of 0.1433, an MSE of 0.0205, an R2 of 0.8529, and a Pearson correlation of 0.9251.

Our proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance task-oriented grasping, prioritizing the post-grasp intention of the agent. We extract human grasp preferences from the ContactPose dataset, and train a hand synergy model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to imitate the participant's grasping actions. Based on this data, we train an agent able to grasp multiple objects while taking into account distinct post-grasp intentions that are task-specific.

But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

Compared with recurrent or hybrid architectures, pure convolutional models offer superior efficiency and full parallelism, yet their fixed receptive fields limit their ability to adaptively capture spatially varying motion patterns. Inspired by biological center-surround organization and frequency-selective signal processing, we propose PFGNet, a fully convolutional framework that dynamically modulates receptive fields through pixel-wise frequency-guided gating. The core Peripheral Frequency Gating (PFG) block extracts localized spectral cues and adaptively fuses multi-scale large-kernel peripheral responses with learnable center suppression, effectively forming spatially adaptive band-pass filters. To maintain efficiency, all large kernels are decomposed into separable 1D convolutions ($1 \\times k$ followed by $k \\times 1$), reducing per-channel computational cost from $O(k^2)$ to $O(2k)$. PFGNet enables structure-aware spatiotemporal modeling without recurrence or attention. Experiments on Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human3.6M, and KTH show that PFGNet delivers SOTA or near-SOTA forecasting performance with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs.

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al., 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97.08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.6 percent false negatives. Despite high validation accuracy, Detectron2 performance degrades on outlier cases including contaminated plates, plastic artifacts, or poor optical clarity. To address this, we developed a multi-agent framework combining DL with vision-language models (VLMs). The VLM agent first classifies plates as valid or invalid. For valid samples, both DL and VLM agents independently estimate colony counts. When predictions align within 5 percent, results are automatically recorded in Postgres and SAP; otherwise, samples are routed for expert review. Expert feedback enables continuous retraining and self-improvement. Initial DL-based automation reduced human verification by 50 percent across vaccine manufacturing sites. With VLM integration, this increased to 85 percent, delivering significant operational savings.

The key challenge is twofold: (i) predict multiple plausible ego intentions according to context and (ii) for each intention, predict the joint responses of surrounding agents, enabling effective what-if decision-making. However, existing methods often fall short, typically treating these interdependent problems in isolation. We propose ParkDiffusion++, which jointly learns a multi-modal ego intention predictor and an ego-conditioned multi-agent joint trajectory predictor for automated parking. Our approach makes several key contributions. First, we introduce an ego intention tokenizer that predicts a small set of discrete endpoint intentions from agent histories and vectorized map polylines. Second, we perform ego-intention-conditioned joint prediction, yielding socially consistent predictions of the surrounding agents for each possible ego intention. Third, we employ a lightweight safety-guided denoiser with different constraints to refine joint scenes during training, thus improving accuracy and safety.

At the fusion level, MAGNET employs structured experts with explicit modality roles -- dominant, balanced, and complementary -- enabling a more interpretable and adaptive combination of behavioral, visual, and textual cues. To further stabilize sparse routing and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a two-stage entropy-weighting mechanism that monitors routing entropy.

However, the robustness of SNNs in complex adversarial environments remains significantly constrained. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that those threshold-neighboring spiking neurons are the key factors limiting the robustness of directly trained SNNs. We find that these neurons set the upper limits for the maximum potential strength of adversarial attacks and are prone to state-flipping under minor disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose a Threshold Guarding Optimization (TGO) method, which comprises two key aspects. First, we incorporate additional constraints into the loss function to move neurons' membrane potentials away from their thresholds. It increases SNNs' gradient sparsity, thereby reducing the theoretical upper bound of adversarial attacks. Second, we introduce noisy spiking neurons to transition the neuronal firing mechanism from deterministic to probabilistic, decreasing their state-flipping probability due to minor disturbances.

Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06RLAIF\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u76ee\u6807RL\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u590d\u6742\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u5bfc\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceAI\u53cd\u9988\uff08RLAIF\uff09\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u76ee\u6807RLAIF\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06RLAIF\u8303\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807RLAIF\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u6620\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

We prove that every forward model in a broad, precisely defined operator class Cimg (encompassing clinical, scientific, and industrial imaging modalities, both linear and nonlinear) admits an epsilon-approximate representation as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are drawn from a library of exactly 11 canonical primitives: Propagate, Modulate, Project, Encode, Convolve, Accumulate, Detect, Sample, Disperse, Scatter, and Transform. We call this the Finite Primitive Basis Theorem. The proof is constructive: we provide an algorithm that, given any H in Cimg, produces a DAG G with relative operator error at most epsilon and graph complexity within prescribed bounds. We further prove that the library is minimal: removing any single primitive causes at least one modality to lose its epsilon-approximate representation. A systematic analysis of nonlinearities in imaging physics shows they fall into two structural categories: pointwise scalar functions (handled by Transform) and self-consistent iterations (unrolled into existing linear primitives). Empirical validation on 31 linear modalities confirms eimg below 0.01 with at most 5 nodes and depth 5, and we provide constructive DAG decompositions for 9 additional nonlinear modalities.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with vision-based systems support these missions through prior terrain investigation or real-time assistance during the mission itself. Vision-based UAV frameworks aid human search tasks by detecting and recognizing specific individuals, then tracking and following them while maintaining a safe distance. A key safety requirement for UAV following is the accurate estimation of the distance between camera and target object under real-world conditions, achieved by fusing multiple image modalities. UAVs with deep learning-based vision systems offer a new approach to the planning and execution of SAR operations. As part of the system for automatic people detection and face recognition using deep learning, in this paper we present the fusion of depth camera measurements and monocular camera-to-body distance estimation for robust tracking and following. Deep learning-based filtering of depth camera data and estimation of camera-to-body distance from a monocular camera are achieved with YOLO-pose, enabling real-time fusion of depth information using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm. The proposed subsystem, designed for use in drones, estimates and measures the distance between the depth camera and the human body keypoints, to maintain the safe distance between the drone and the human target. Our system provides an accurate estimated distance, which has been validated against motion capture ground truth data.

While image exemplars provide an alternative, they primarily encode appearance cues such as color and texture, which are often unrelated to a part's geometric identity. In industrial settings, a single component may be produced in different materials, finishes, or colors, making appearance-based prompting unreliable. In contrast, such objects are typically defined by precise CAD models that capture their canonical geometry. We propose a CAD-prompted segmentation framework built on SAM3 that uses canonical multi-view renderings of a CAD model as prompt input.

To tackle these issues, we introduce WildGHand, an optimization-based framework that enables self-adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting on in-the-wild videos and produces high-fidelity hand avatars. WildGHand incorporates two key components: (i) a dynamic perturbation disentanglement module that explicitly represents perturbations as time-varying biases on 3D Gaussian attributes during optimization, and (ii) a perturbation-aware optimization strategy that generates per-frame anisotropic weighted masks to guide optimization. Together, these components allow the framework to identify and suppress perturbations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further curate a dataset of monocular hand videos captured under diverse perturbations to benchmark in-the-wild hand avatar reconstruction. Extensive experiments on this dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that WildGHand achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over its base model across multiple metrics (e.g., up to a $15.8\\%$ relative gain in PSNR and a $23.1\\%$ relative reduction in LPIPS).

Although they are successful in bringing internet-scale semantic understanding to robotics, existing VLAs are primarily \"stateless\" and struggle with memory-dependent long horizon tasks. In this work, we explore a way to impart both spatial and temporal memory to a VLA by incorporating a language scratchpad. The scratchpad makes it possible to memorize task-specific information, such as object positions, and it allows the model to keep track of a plan and progress towards subgoals within that plan. We evaluate this approach on a split of memory-dependent tasks from the ClevrSkills environment, on MemoryBench, as well as on a challenging real-world pick-and-place task.

AIForge-Doc addresses this gap by systematically forging numeric fields in real-world receipt and form images using two AI inpainting APIs -- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and Ideogram v2 Edit -- yielding 4,061 forged images from four public document datasets (CORD, WildReceipt, SROIE, XFUND) across nine languages, annotated with pixel-precise tampered-region masks in DocTamper-compatible format.

Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific benchmark effectively and comprehensively assesses LLM capabilities, highlighting that general LLMs are still incompetent for domain-specific tasks. Meanwhile, with the proposed benchmark and datasets, Qwen-BIM is developed and achieves a 21.0% average increase in G-Eval score compared to the base LLM model. Notably, with only 14B parameters, performance of Qwen-BIM is comparable to that of general LLMs with 671B parameters for BIM-based design tasks.

However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions.

In EDID, robots are allowed to exchange information only upon meeting. Crucially, EDID assumes that the robots are not allowed to schedule their meetings. As such, the robots have no means to anticipate when, where, and who they will meet. As a step towards the design of storage and routing algorithms for EDID, in this paper we propose a model of information diffusion that captures the essential dynamics of EDID. The model is derived from first principles and is composed of two levels: a micro model, based on a generalization of the concept of `mean free path'; and a macro model, which captures the global dynamics of information diffusion. We validate the model through extensive robot simulations, in which we consider swarm size, communication range, environment size, and different random motion regimes.

While alignment failures increasingly cause real-world harm, comprehensive evaluation frameworks with realistic multi-turn scenarios remain lacking. We introduce an alignment benchmark spanning 904 scenarios across six categories -- Honesty, Safety, Non-Manipulation, Robustness, Corrigibility, and Scheming -- validated as realistic by human raters. Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board. Factor analysis reveals that alignment behaves as a unified construct (analogous to the g-factor in cognitive research) with models scoring high on one category tending to score high on others.

The source latent serves as structural information of the video, while the edited latent provides the target transformation for learning propagation. Our pipeline enables an additional adapter attached to the pre-trained VDM to learn to propagate edits via Guidance-Modulated Flow Matching (GMFM) loss, which guides the model to replicate the target transformation.

Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HALO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7EM-CoT\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u524d\u77bb\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u5408\u6210EM-CoT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "HALO\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565pi_0\uff08RoboTwin\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534734.1%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cEM-CoT\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HALO\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7EM-CoT\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines implicitly assume near-simultaneous image capture and limited appearance change, and therefore fail when applied to long-term monitoring scenarios such as coral reef surveys, where substantial visual and structural change is common. In this paper, we show that the primary limitation of current approaches lies in their reliance on post-hoc alignment of independently reconstructed sessions, which is insufficient under large temporal appearance change. We address this limitation by enforcing cross-session correspondences directly within a joint SfM reconstruction. Our approach combines complementary handcrafted and learned visual features to robustly establish correspondences across large temporal gaps, enabling the reconstruction of a single coherent 3D model from imagery captured years apart, where standard independent and joint SfM pipelines break down. We evaluate our method on long-term coral reef datasets exhibiting significant real-world change, and demonstrate consistent joint reconstruction across sessions in cases where existing methods fail to produce coherent reconstructions. To ensure scalability to large datasets, we further restrict expensive learned feature matching to a small set of likely cross-session image pairs identified via visual place recognition, which reduces computational cost and improves alignment robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408SfM\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u76843D\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SfM\u6d41\u7a0b\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u50cf\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u8fd1\u4e14\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u957f\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408SfM\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f3a\u5236\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc6\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u5408SfM\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization.

We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts.

One fundamental challenge in this area involves accurately parsing hands and active objects. While transformer-based architectures have demonstrated considerable potential for such tasks, several key limitations remain unaddressed: 1) existing query initialization mechanisms rely primarily on semantic cues or learnable parameters, demonstrating limited adaptability to changing active objects across varying input scenes; 2) previous transformer-based methods utilize pixel-level semantic features to iteratively refine queries during mask generation, which may introduce interaction-irrelevant content into the final embeddings; and 3) prevailing models are susceptible to \"interaction illusion\", producing physically inconsistent predictions. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Interaction-aware Transformer (InterFormer), which integrates three key components, i.e., a Dynamic Query Generator (DQG), a Dual-context Feature Selector (DFS), and the Conditional Co-occurrence (CoCo) loss. The DQG explicitly grounds query initialization in the spatial dynamics of hand-object contact, enabling targeted generation of interaction-aware queries for hands and various active objects. The DFS fuses coarse interactive cues with semantic features, thereby suppressing interaction-irrelevant noise and emphasizing the learning of interactive relationships. The CoCo loss incorporates hand-object relationship constraints to enhance physical consistency in prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the EgoHOS and the challenging out-of-distribution mini-HOI4D datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization ability.

However, most existing approaches rely on static visual or textual cues, neglecting that affordances are inherently defined by dynamic actions. As a result, they often struggle to localize the true contact regions involved in real interactions. We take a different perspective. Humans learn how to use objects by observing and imitating actions, not just by examining shapes. Motivated by this intuition, we introduce video-guided 3D affordance grounding, which leverages dynamic interaction sequences to provide functional supervision. To achieve this, we propose VAGNet, a framework that aligns video-derived interaction cues with 3D structure to resolve ambiguities that static cues cannot address.

Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate training dynamics and introduce substantial storage and encoding overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Squint, a visual Soft Actor Critic method that achieves faster wall-clock training than prior visual off-policy and on-policy methods. Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation. We evaluate on the SO-101 Task Set, a new suite of eight manipulation tasks in ManiSkill3 with heavy domain randomization, and demonstrate sim-to-real transfer to a real SO-101 robot.

This paper aims to make the entire OWOD framework interpretable, enabling the detector to truly \"knowing the unknown\". To this end, we propose a concept-driven InterPretable OWOD framework(IPOW) by introducing a Concept Decomposition Model (CDM) for OWOD, which explicitly decomposes the coupled RoI features in Faster R-CNN into discriminative, shared, and background concepts. Discriminative concepts identify the most discriminative features to enlarge the distances between known categories, while shared and background concepts, due to their strong generalization ability, can be readily transferred to detect unknown categories. Leveraging the interpretable framework, we identify that known-unknown confusion arises when unknown objects fall into the discriminative space of known classes. To address this, we propose Concept-Guided Rectification (CGR) to further resolve such confusion.

However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth.

In response, a common proactive defense leverages fragile watermarks to detect, localize, or even recover manipulated regions. However, these methods always assume an adversary unaware of the embedded watermark, overlooking their inherent vulnerability to watermark removal attacks. Furthermore, this fragility is exacerbated in the commonly used dual-watermark strategy that adds a robust watermark for image ownership verification, where mutual interference and limited embedding capacity reduce the fragile watermark's effectiveness. To address the gap, we propose RecoverMark, a watermarking framework that achieves robust manipulation localization, content recovery, and ownership verification simultaneously. Our key insight is twofold. First, we exploit a critical real-world constraint: an adversary must preserve the background's semantic consistency to avoid visual detection, even if they apply global, imperceptible watermark removal attacks. Second, using the image's own content (face, in this paper) as the watermark enhances extraction robustness. Based on these insights, RecoverMark treats the protected face content itself as the watermark and embeds it into the surrounding background. By designing a robust two-stage training paradigm with carefully crafted distortion layers that simulate comprehensive potential attacks and a progressive training strategy, RecoverMark achieves a robust watermark embedding in no fragile manner for image manipulation localization, recovery, and image IP protection simultaneously.

More specifically, specific 3D objects are always captured in particular scenes with fixed camera poses, and hence lacks necessary diversity. Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation. In this way, the refreshed training data in all epochs can cover the full spectrum of independent object, scene, and camera pose combinations. This scheme can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost M3OD models, working flexibly with both fully and sparsely supervised settings. In the sparsely-supervised setting, objects closest to the ego-camera for all instances are sparsely annotated. We then can flexibly increase the annotated objects to control annotation cost.

Extensive evaluations on sparse matching benchmarks, including relative pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate that TraqPoint significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) keypoint detection and description methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TraqPoint\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6TraqPoint\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTraqPoint\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TraqPoint\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5339\u914d\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

When encountering an unfamiliar KG, such users face a distinct orientation challenge: they do not know what questions are possible, how the knowledge is structured, or how to begin exploration. This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity. We argue that these barriers converge at the moment of first contact, distinguishing the IEP from related concepts that presuppose an existing starting point or information goal. Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures. In articulating the IEP, this paper provides a theoretical lens for evaluating KG interfaces and for designing entry-point scaffolding that supports initial exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff08IEP\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u7528\u6237\u521d\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u521d\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e3a\u975e\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u521d\u6b21\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982ASK\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u89c5\u98df\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7406\u8bba\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86KG\u63a2\u7d22\u754c\u9762\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86IEP\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u672c\u4f53\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dKG\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5373\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7528\u4e8e\u8303\u56f4\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u7528\u6237\u6784\u5efa\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u672c\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f20\u8fbeKG\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff08IEP\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u754c\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u652f\u6301\u521d\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5165\u53e3\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, its sparse and weak geometric cues make reliable instance activation difficult, limiting the effectiveness of existing radar-camera fusion paradigms. BEV-level fusion offers global scene understanding but suffers from weak instance focus, while perspective-level fusion captures instance details but lacks holistic context. To address these limitations, we propose SIFormer, a scene-instance aware transformer for 3D object detection using 4D radar and camera. SIFormer first suppresses background noise during view transformation through segmentation- and depth-guided localization. It then introduces a cross-view activation mechanism that injects 2D instance cues into BEV space, enabling reliable instance awareness under weak radar geometry. Finally, a transformer-based fusion module aggregates complementary image semantics and radar geometry for robust perception. As a result, with the aim of enhancing instance awareness, SIFormer bridges the gap between the two paradigms, combining their complementary strengths to address inherent sparse nature of radar and improve detection accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that SIFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet and NuScenes datasets.

However, due to the sparse information content in individual events, directly processing the raw event data to solve vision tasks is highly inefficient, which severely limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods in real-time tasks, such as motion segmentation, a fundamental task for dynamic scene understanding. Incorporating normal flow as an intermediate representation to compress motion information from event clusters within a localized region provides a more effective solution. In this work, we propose a normal flow-based motion segmentation framework for event-based vision. Leveraging the dense normal flow directly learned from event neighborhoods as input, we formulate the motion segmentation task as an energy minimization problem solved via graph cuts, and optimize it iteratively with normal flow clustering and motion model fitting. By using a normal flow-based motion model initialization and fitting method, the proposed system is able to efficiently estimate the motion models of independently moving objects with only a limited number of candidate models, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and ensures real-time performance, achieving nearly a 800x speedup in comparison to the open-source state-of-the-art method.

DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEEPSYNTH \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30 LLM \u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30 LLM \u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa DEEPSYNTH \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b 120 \u4e2a\u8de8 7 \u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u548c 67 \u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728 DEEPSYNTH \u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684 11 \u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb LLM \u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u6700\u9ad8 F1 \u5206\u6570\u4e3a 8.97 \u548c 17.5\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "DEEPSYNTH \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle in dynamic environments, particularly moving objects complicate 3D reconstruction and, in turn, hinder reliable tracking. The emergence of 4D reconstruction, especially 4D Gaussian splatting, offers a promising direction for addressing these challenges, yet its potential for 4D-aware SLAM remains largely underexplored. Along this direction, we propose a robust and efficient framework, namely Reweighting Uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (RU4D-SLAM) for 4D scene reconstruction, that introduces temporal factors into spatial 3D representation while incorporating uncertainty-aware perception of scene changes, blurred image synthesis, and dynamic scene reconstruction. We enhance dynamic scene representation by integrating motion blur rendering, and improve uncertainty-aware tracking by extending per-pixel uncertainty modeling, which is originally designed for static scenarios, to handle blurred images. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-guided reweighting mechanism for per-pixel uncertainty estimation in dynamic scenes, and introduce a learnable opacity weight to support adaptive 4D mapping. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both trajectory accuracy and 4D scene reconstruction, particularly in dynamic environments with moving objects and low-quality inputs.

Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information. (2) A representation disentanglement and alignment strategy is designed to mitigate unnecessary noise and modality-specific biases by introducing modality-specific and modality-shared encoders, ensuring a clearer separation between modality-invariant and modality-specific representations.

While existing approaches reduce dataset size by discarding samples, they often ignore the significant redundancy within each image -- particularly in the color space. To address this, we propose Dataset Color Quantization (DCQ), a unified framework that compresses visual datasets by reducing color-space redundancy while preserving information crucial for model training. DCQ achieves this by enforcing consistent palette representations across similar images, selectively retaining semantically important colors guided by model perception, and maintaining structural details necessary for effective feature learning. Extensive experiments across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that DCQ significantly improves training performance under aggressive compression, offering a scalable and robust solution for dataset-level storage reduction.

However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cdNeRF\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u98de\u884c\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7535\u6c60\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5b8c\u6210\u5de1\u68c0\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdNeRF\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6b65\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u5e27\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u5d4c\u5165NeRF\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u98de\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u98de\u884c\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534750%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002"}}

However, the inherent sparsity and noise of radar point clouds present significant challenges for accurate 3D object detection, underscoring the need for effective and robust point clouds densification. Despite recent progress, existing densification methods often fail to address the extreme sparsity of 4D radar point clouds and exhibit limited robustness when processing scenes with a small number of points. In this paper, we propose SD4R, a novel framework that transforms sparse radar point clouds into dense representations. SD4R begins by utilizing a foreground point generator (FPG) to mitigate noise propagation and produce densified point clouds. Subsequently, a logit-query encoder (LQE) enhances conventional pillarization, resulting in robust feature representations. Through these innovations, our SD4R demonstrates strong capability in both noise reduction and foreground point densification. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available View-of-Delft dataset demonstrate that SD4R achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86VLM\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97RNLE\u8ddd\u79bb\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u52a0\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u914d\u7f6e\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u6d4b\u91cf\u6216\u4e13\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4eceRGB\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u4f30\u7b97H\u548cV\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684VLM\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u52a0\u5206\u5272\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u3001\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u56de\u5f52\u6765\u4f30\u7b97H\u548cV\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f30\u7b97H\u548cV\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a6-8\u5398\u7c73\u548c5-8\u5398\u7c73\u3002\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8620-30%\uff08H\uff09\u548c35-40%\uff08V\uff09\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97RNLE\u8ddd\u79bb\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

While 3D generative models have advanced dramatically, models specifically designed to assist human imagination in 3D creation -- particularly for detailing abstractions from coarse to fine -- have not been explored. We propose a framework that enables intuitive and interactive 3D shape generation by iteratively splitting bounding boxes to refine the set of bounding boxes. The main technical components of our framework are two generative models: the box-splitting generative model and the box-to-shape generative model. The first model, named BoxSplitGen, generates a collection of 3D part bounding boxes with varying granularity by iteratively splitting coarse bounding boxes. It utilizes part bounding boxes created through agglomerative merging and learns the reverse of the merging process -- the splitting sequences. The model consists of two main components: the first learns the categorical distribution of the box to be split, and the second learns the distribution of the two new boxes, given the set of boxes and the indication of which box to split. The second model, the box-to-shape generative model, is trained by leveraging the 3D shape priors learned by an existing 3D diffusion model while adapting the model to incorporate bounding box conditioning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the box-splitting generative model outperforms token prediction models and the inpainting approach with an unconditional diffusion model.

However, a fundamental parametric gap remains: existing models rely on descriptive language, whereas professional workflows require precise numeric control over object location, size, and color. In this work, we introduce BBQ, a large-scale text-to-image model that directly conditions on numeric bounding boxes and RGB triplets within a unified structured-text framework. We obtain precise spatial and chromatic control by training on captions enriched with parametric annotations, without architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. This also enables intuitive user interfaces such as object dragging and color pickers, replacing ambiguous iterative prompting with precise, familiar controls. Across comprehensive evaluations, BBQ achieves strong box alignment and improves RGB color fidelity over state-of-the-art baselines.

To obtain crisp edges, most existing approaches rely on two hand-crafted post-processing algorithms, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and skeleton-based thinning, which are non-differentiable and hinder end-to-end optimization. Moreover, all existing crisp edge detection methods still depend on such post-processing to achieve satisfactory results. To address this limitation, we propose \\MethodLPP, a lightweight, only $\\sim$21K additional parameters, and plug-and-play matching-based supervision module that can be appended to any edge detection model for joint end-to-end learning of crisp edges. At each training iteration, \\MethodLPP performs one-to-one matching between predicted and ground-truth edges based on spatial distance and confidence, ensuring consistency between training and testing protocols. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate that integrating \\MethodLPP substantially improves the performance of existing edge detection models.

Due to the lack of real-world pattern-image paired data, prior approaches fine-tune large vision language models (VLMs) on synthetic garment datasets generated by randomly sampling from a parametric garment model GarmentCode. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to in-the-wild images, fail to capture real-world correlations between garment parts, and are typically restricted to single-layer outfits. In contrast, we observe that VLMs are effective at describing garments in natural language, yet perform poorly when asked to directly regress GarmentCode parameters from images. To bridge this gap, we propose NGL (Natural Garment Language), a novel intermediate language that restructures GarmentCode into a representation more understandable to language models. Leveraging this language, we introduce NGL-Prompter, a training-free pipeline that queries large VLMs to extract structured garment parameters, which are then deterministically mapped to valid GarmentCode. We evaluate our method on the Dress4D, CloSe and a newly collected dataset of approximately 5,000 in-the-wild fashion images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard geometry metrics and is strongly preferred in both human and GPT-based perceptual evaluations compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, NGL-prompter can recover multi-layer outfits whereas competing methods focus mostly on single-layer garments, highlighting its strong generalization to real-world images even with occluded parts. These results demonstrate that accurate sewing pattern reconstruction is possible without costly model training. Our code and data will be released for research use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNGL\u548cNGL-Prompter\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230GarmentCode\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03VLMs\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230VLMs\u64c5\u957f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u56de\u5f52GarmentCode\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNGL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5c06GarmentCode\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1NGL-Prompter\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u518d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u6620\u5c04\u5230GarmentCode\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dress4D\u3001CloSe\u548c\u7ea65,000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u5c1a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNGL-Prompter\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51faNGL\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u670d\u88c5\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u548cNGL-Prompter\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u670d\u88c5\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684GarmentCode\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c42\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approaches encounter challenges in achieving consistent tissue surface reconstruction, while existing NeRF-based methods lack real-time rendering capabilities. In pursuit of both smooth deformable surfaces and real-time rendering, we introduce a novel approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we introduce surface-aware reconstruction, initially employing a Sign Distance Field-based method to construct a mesh, subsequently utilizing this mesh to constrain the Gaussian Splatting reconstruction process.

However, recent encoder-based methods, while efficient and tuning-free, often suffer from content leakage, where semantic elements from the style image undesirably appear in the output, impairing prompt fidelity and stylistic consistency. In this work, we introduce CleanStyle, a plug-and-play framework that filters out content-related noise from the style embedding without retraining. Motivated by empirical analysis, we observe that such leakage predominantly stems from the tail components of the style embedding, which are isolated via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To address this, we propose CleanStyleSVD (CS-SVD), which dynamically suppresses tail components using a time-aware exponential schedule, providing clean, style-preserving conditional embeddings throughout the denoising process. Furthermore, we present Style-Specific Classifier-Free Guidance (SS-CFG), which reuses the suppressed tail components to construct style-aware unconditional inputs. Unlike conventional methods that use generic negative embeddings (e.g., zero vectors), SS-CFG introduces targeted negative signals that reflect style-specific but prompt-irrelevant visual elements. This enables the model to effectively suppress these distracting patterns during generation, thereby improving prompt fidelity and enhancing the overall visual quality of stylized outputs. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-based diffusion models without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CleanStyle substantially reduces content leakage, improves stylization quality and improves prompt alignment across a wide range of style references and prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "CleanStyle\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CS-SVD\u548cSS-CFG\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u7d20\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u793a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CleanStyleSVD\uff08CS-SVD\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u6291\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Style-Specific Classifier-Free Guidance\uff08SS-CFG\uff09\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u6291\u5236\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u6210\u5206\u6784\u5efa\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eCleanStyle\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "CleanStyle\u901a\u8fc7CS-SVD\u548cSS-CFG\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Although these two paradigms originate from distinct communities, both share a common evolution -- from noisy observations to clean images. In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic formulation that bridges Monte Carlo rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling. First, a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) formulation for Monte Carlo integration under the Central Limit Theorem is modeled. Through instantiation via physically based path tracing, we convert it into a physically grounded SDE representation. Moreover, we provide a systematic analysis of how the physical characteristics of path tracing can be extended to existing diffusion models from the perspective of noise variance.

Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image.

While MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, its interpretation remains exceptionally challenging. Radiologists must identify multiple potential abnormalities within complex anatomical structures across different imaging planes, a process that requires significant expertise and is prone to variability. We developed OrthoDiffusion, a unified diffusion-based foundation model designed for multi-task musculoskeletal MRI interpretation. The framework utilizes three orientation-specific 3D diffusion models, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on 15,948 unlabeled knee MRI scans, to learn robust anatomical features from sagittal, coronal, and axial views. These view-specific representations are integrated to support diverse clinical tasks, including anatomical segmentation and multi-label diagnosis. Our evaluation demonstrates that OrthoDiffusion achieves excellent performance in the segmentation of 11 knee structures and the detection of 8 knee abnormalities. The model exhibited remarkable robustness across different clinical centers and MRI field strengths, consistently outperforming traditional supervised models. Notably, in settings where labeled data was scarce, OrthoDiffusion maintained high diagnostic precision using only 10\\% of training labels. Furthermore, the anatomical representations learned from knee imaging proved highly transferable to other joints, achieving strong diagnostic performance across 11 diseases of the ankle and shoulder. These findings suggest that diffusion-based foundation models can serve as a unified platform for multi-disease diagnosis and anatomical segmentation, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of musculoskeletal MRI interpretation in real-world clinical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrthoDiffusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abcMRI\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0cMRI\u89e3\u8bfb\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u6613\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86OrthoDiffusion\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abcMRI\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u76843D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u572815,948\u4e2a\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u819d\u5173\u8282MRI\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u77e2\u72b6\u9762\u3001\u51a0\u72b6\u9762\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "OrthoDiffusion\u572811\u4e2a\u819d\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5272\u548c8\u4e2a\u819d\u5173\u8282\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548cMRI\u573a\u5f3a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abcMRI\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing data, cross-modality domain shifts pose a critical challenge, particularly when models trained on one modality fail to generalize to another. Many existing solutions require paired multimodal data per patient or rely on complex architectures, both of which are impractical in real clinical settings. In this work, we consider a realistic FL scenario where each client holds single-modality data (CT or MRI), and systematically investigate augmentation strategies for cross-modality generalization. Using abdominal organ segmentation and whole-heart segmentation as representative multi-class and binary segmentation benchmarks, we evaluate convolution-based spatial augmentation, frequency-domain manipulation, domain-specific normalization, and global intensity nonlinear (GIN) augmentation. Our results show that GIN consistently outperforms alternatives in both centralized and federated settings by simulating cross-modality appearance variations while preserving anatomical structure. For the pancreas, Dice score improved from 0.073 to 0.437, a 498% gain. Our federated approach achieves 93-98% of centralized training accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-modality generalization without compromising data privacy, pointing toward feasible federated AI deployment across diverse healthcare systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faGIN\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80f0\u817aDice\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347498%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u9891\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548cGIN\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "GIN\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80f0\u817a\u5206\u5272\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.073\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.437\uff08\u63d0\u5347498%\uff09\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec393-98%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff08GIN\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597AI\u7684\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present a biomechanics-aware keypoint simulation framework that augments existing human pose datasets with anatomically consistent 3D spinal keypoints derived from musculoskeletal modeling. Using this framework, we create the first open dataset, named SIMSPINE, which provides sparse vertebra-level 3D spinal annotations for natural full-body motions in indoor multi-camera capture without external restraints. With 2.14 million frames, this enables data-driven learning of vertebral kinematics from subtle posture variations and bridges the gap between musculoskeletal simulation and computer vision. In addition, we release pretrained baselines covering fine-tuned 2D detectors, monocular 3D pose lifting models, and multi-view reconstruction pipelines, establishing a unified benchmark for biomechanically valid spine motion estimation. Specifically, our 2D spine baselines improve the state-of-the-art from 0.63 to 0.80 AUC in controlled environments, and from 0.91 to 0.93 AP for in-the-wild spine tracking.

While some promising approaches attempt to mitigate this by constructing Q&A data for auxiliary training, they still fail to fundamentally equip VLMs with the ability to comprehensively handle diverse evaluation protocols. We thus chart a new course, advocating for the infusion of VLMs with the cross-view geometric grounding of mature 3D foundation models, closing this critical capability gap in autonomous driving. In this spirit, we propose a novel architecture, VGGDrive, which empowers Vision-language models with cross-view Geometric Grounding for autonomous Driving. Concretely, to bridge the cross-view 3D geometric features from the frozen visual 3D model with the VLM's 2D visual features, we introduce a plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE). The CVGE decouples the base VLM architecture and effectively empowers the VLM with 3D features through a hierarchical adaptive injection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that VGGDrive enhances base VLM performance across five autonomous driving benchmarks, including tasks like cross-view risk perception, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. It's our belief that mature 3D foundation models can empower autonomous driving tasks through effective integration, and we hope our initial exploration demonstrates the potential of this paradigm to the autonomous driving community.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGGDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u54083D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe3D\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5e73\u5eb8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6210\u719f\u76843D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe3D\u51e0\u4f55\u8d4b\u80fd\u5668\uff08CVGE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u51bb\u7ed3\u76843D\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eVLM\u76842D\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6865\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVGGDrive\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u7840VLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u67b6\u6784VGGDrive\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6210\u719f\u76843D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent optimisation-based methods achieve strong zero-shot edits from text, they struggle to preserve identity or capture details that language alone cannot express. Many visual concepts such as facial structure, material texture, or object geometry are impossible to express purely through text prompts alone. To address this gap, we introduce a training-free framework for concept-based image editing, which unifies Optimised DDS with LoRA-driven concept composition, where the training data of the LoRA represent the concept. Our approach enables combining and controlling multiple visual concepts directly within the diffusion process, integrating semantic guidance from text with low-level cues from pretrained concept adapters.

Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) tackles this challenge by estimating encoder filters (i.e., kernel weights) from user-drawn markers on discriminative regions of a few representative images without traditional optimization. Such an encoder combined with an adaptive decoder comprises a FLIM network fully trained without backpropagation. Prior research has demonstrated their effectiveness in Salient Object Detection (SOD), being significantly lighter than existing lightweight models. This study revisits FLIM SOD and introduces FLIM-Bag of Feature Points (FLIM-BoFP), a considerably faster filter estimation method. The previous approach, FLIM-Cluster, derives filters through patch clustering at each encoder's block, leading to computational overhead and reduced control over filter locations. FLIM-BoFP streamlines this process by performing a single clustering at the input block, creating a bag of feature points, and defining filters directly from mapped feature points across all blocks. The paper evaluates the benefits in efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of FLIM-BoFP compared to FLIM-Cluster and other state-of-the-art baselines for parasite detection in optical microscopy images.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLIM-BoFP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u4e86FLIM\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bc4\u751f\u866b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdbFLIM-Cluster\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "FLIM-BoFP\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u888b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5757\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\u70b9\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86FLIM-Cluster\u7684\u591a\u5757\u805a\u7c7b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "FLIM-BoFP\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eFLIM-Cluster\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bc4\u751f\u866b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FLIM-BoFP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5bc4\u751f\u866b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While traditional methods are fast, they lack adaptability and performance. Conversely, deep learning approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results but suffer from critical inefficiencies: their reliance on slow, resource-intensive, patch-based training introduces a significant gap with full-resolution inference. We propose a novel hybrid framework that resolves this trade-off. Our method utilizes a learnable U-Net to generate a dynamic guidance map that directs a classic, fixed Laplacian pyramid fusion kernel. This decoupling of policy learning from pixel synthesis enables remarkably efficient full-resolution training, eliminating the train-inference gap. Consequently, our model achieves SOTA-comparable performance in about one minute on a RTX 4090 or two minutes on a consumer laptop GPU from scratch without any external model and demonstrates powerful zero-shot generalization across diverse tasks, from infrared-visible to medical imaging.

Based on this finding, we propose DA-Cal, a dedicated cross-domain calibration framework that transforms target domain calibration into soft pseudo-label optimization.

Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training. These dynamically selected texts serve as enriched semantic supervisions to stochastically optimize the vision-language model, promoting robustness and mitigating overfitting. Experiments on three benchmark WSI datasets show that MUSE consistently outperforms existing vision-language baselines in few-shot settings, demonstrating that effective few-shot pathology learning requires not only richer semantic sources but also their active and sample-aware semantic optimization.

Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence.

Safety-guidance-based methods have been proposed to mitigate harmful outputs by steering generation away from harmful zones, where the zones are averaged across multiple harmful categories based on predefined keywords. However, these approaches fail to capture the complex interplay among different harm categories, leading to \"harmful conflicts\" where mitigating one type of harm may inadvertently amplify another, thus increasing overall harmful rate. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-aware Adaptive Safety Guidance (CASG), a training-free framework that dynamically identifies and applies the category-aligned safety direction during generation. CASG is composed of two components: (i) Conflict-aware Category Identification (CaCI), which identifies the harmful category most aligned with the model's evolving generative state, and (ii) Conflict-resolving Guidance Application (CrGA), which applies safety steering solely along the identified category to avoid multi-category interference. CASG can be applied to both latent-space and text-space safeguards.

Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

However, we find that leading MLLMs and specialist OCR models largely fail to perceive these structural anomalies, creating a critical bottleneck for both VTR evaluation and RL-based optimization. As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR.

Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth.

We propose LongVideo-R1, an active, reasoning-equipped multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent designed for efficient video context navigation, avoiding the redundancy of exhaustive search. At the core of LongVideo-R1 lies a reasoning module that leverages high-level visual cues to infer the most informative video clip for subsequent processing. During inference, the agent initiates traversal from top-level visual summaries and iteratively refines its focus, immediately halting the exploration process upon acquiring sufficient knowledge to answer the query. To facilitate training, we first extract hierarchical video captions from CGBench, a video corpus with grounding annotations, and guide GPT-5 to generate 33K high-quality chain-of-thought-with-tool trajectories. The LongVideo-R1 agent is fine-tuned upon the Qwen-3-8B model through a two-stage paradigm: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), where RL employs a specifically designed reward function to maximize selective and efficient clip navigation. Experiments on multiple long video benchmarks validate the effectiveness of name, which enjoys superior tradeoff between QA accuracy and efficiency.

Standard neural networks lack inherent rotation invariance and typically rely on data augmentation or architectural modifications to improve robustness. Although effective, these approaches increase computational demands, require specialised implementations, or alter network structures, limiting their applicability. This paper introduces General Intensity Direction (GID), a preprocessing method that improves rotation robustness without modifying the network architecture. The method estimates a global orientation for each image and aligns it to a canonical reference frame, allowing standard models to process inputs more consistently across different rotations. Unlike moment-based approaches that extract invariant descriptors, this method directly transforms the image while preserving spatial structure, making it compatible with convolutional networks.

However, we identify a neighbor compensation effect in these approaches: dropped Gaussians are often compensated by their neighbors, weakening the intended regularization. Moreover, these methods overlook the contribution of high-degree spherical harmonic coefficients (SH) to overfitting. To address these issues, we propose DropAnSH-GS, a novel anchor-based Dropout strategy. Rather than dropping Gaussians independently, our method randomly selects certain Gaussians as anchors and simultaneously removes their spatial neighbors. This effectively disrupts local redundancies near anchors and encourages the model to learn more robust, globally informed representations. Furthermore, we extend the Dropout to color attributes by randomly dropping higher-degree SH to concentrate appearance information in lower-degree SH. This strategy further mitigates overfitting and enables flexible post-training model compression via SH truncation. Experimental results demonstrate that DropAnSH-GS substantially outperforms existing Dropout methods with negligible computational overhead, and can be readily integrated into various 3DGS variants to enhance their performances.

While recent feed-forward methods have shown promise for 3D reconstruction, they struggle with long-range driving sequences due to quadratic complexity in sequence length and challenges in modeling dynamic objects over extended durations. We propose UFO, a novel recurrent paradigm that combines the benefits of optimization-based and feed-forward methods for efficient long-range 4D reconstruction. Our approach maintains a 4D scene representation that is iteratively refined as new observations arrive, using a visibility-based filtering mechanism to select informative scene tokens and enable efficient processing of long sequences.

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential to automate annotation, their capability to replace human annotators remains underexplored. This paper aims to analyze the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations and to propose an effective solution that enables MLLM-based annotation to replace manual labeling. Our analysis of MLLM annotations reveals that, under a conservative estimate, MLLMs can reduce annotation cost to as low as one-thousandth of the human cost, mainly accounting for GPU usage, which is nearly negligible compared to manual efforts. Their annotation quality reaches about 50\\% to 80\\% of human performance, while achieving over 90\\% performance on downstream training tasks.Motivated by these findings, we propose TagLLM, a novel framework for image tagging, which aims to narrow the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations. TagLLM comprises two components: Candidates generation, which employs structured group-wise prompting to efficiently produce a compact candidate set that covers as many true labels as possible while reducing subsequent annotation workload; and label disambiguation, which interactively calibrates the semantic concept of categories in the prompts and effectively refines the candidate labels.

We focus on the challenging case of logo-object decomposition, where the goal is to disentangle a logo from the surface on which it appears while faithfully preserving both layers. Our method fine-tunes a pretrained diffusion model via lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a cycle-consistent tuning strategy that jointly trains decomposition and composition models, enforcing reconstruction consistency between decomposed and recomposed images. This bidirectional supervision substantially enhances robustness in cases where the layers exhibit complex interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive self-improving process, which iteratively augments the training set with high-quality model-generated examples to refine performance.

However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "VII\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fbI2V\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u853d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aI2V\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6VII\u3002", "method": "VII\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u91cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u63a5\u5730\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6076\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u9759\u6001\u5371\u5bb3\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5c06\u610f\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u690d\u5165\u5b89\u5168\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1aI2V\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cVII\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe83.5%\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "VII\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86I2V\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe83.5%\u3002"}}

While Detection Transformers (DETR) have demonstrated significant performance improvements, current real-time DETR models are challenging to reproduce from scratch due to excessive pre-training overheads on the backbone, constraining research advancements by hindering the exploration of novel backbone architectures.

Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Consequently, during multi-turn revisions, they often fall into repetitive and ineffective attempts, failing to achieve stable improvements in answer quality.To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative self-correction framework that endows models with two key capabilities: Capability Reflection and Memory Reflection. This framework guides the model to first diagnose errors and generate a correction plan via Capability Reflection, then leverage Memory Reflection to review past attempts to avoid repetition and explore new solutions, and finally, optimize the answer through rigorous re-reasoning. Experiments on the challenging OCRBench v2 benchmark show that OCR-Agent outperforms the current open-source SOTA model InternVL3-8B by +2.0 on English and +1.2 on Chinese subsets, while achieving state-of-the-art results in Visual Understanding (79.9) and Reasoning (66.5) - surpassing even larger fine-tuned models.

The key to achieving this goal is being able to recognize zone occupancy in real time, without impeding occupants' activities or compromising privacy. While low-resolution, privacy-preserving time-of-flight (ToF) sensor networks have demonstrated good performance in zone counting, the performance depends on careful sensor placement. To address this issue, we propose an automatic sensor placement method that determines optimal sensor layouts for a given number of sensors, and can predict the counting accuracy of such a layout. In particular, given the geometric constraints of an office environment, we simulate a large number of occupant trajectories.

Traditional photogrammetry achieves exceptional detail but requires extensive camera arrays (25-200+ views), substantial computation, and manual cleanup in challenging areas like facial hair. Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details.

Recovering B-rep representation from unstructured data is a challenging and valuable task of computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved the recovery of 3D shape geometry, but still depend on dense and clean point clouds and struggle to generalize to novel shapes. We propose B-rep Gaussian Splatting (BrepGaussian), a novel framework that learns 3D parametric representations from 2D images. We employ a Gaussian Splatting renderer with learnable features, followed by a specific fitting strategy.

This paper introduces Urban Dynamics VideoQA, a benchmark dataset that captures the unscripted real-world behavior of dynamic urban scenes. UDVideoQA is curated from 16 hours of traffic footage recorded at multiple city intersections under diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. It employs an event-driven dynamic blur technique to ensure privacy preservation without compromising scene fidelity. Using a unified annotation pipeline, the dataset contains 28K question-answer pairs generated across 8 hours of densely annotated video, averaging one question per second. Its taxonomy follows a hierarchical reasoning level, spanning basic understanding and attribution to event reasoning, reverse reasoning, and counterfactual inference, enabling systematic evaluation of both visual grounding and causal reasoning. Comprehensive experiments benchmark 10 SOTA VideoLMs on UDVideoQA and 8 models on a complementary video question generation benchmark. Results reveal a persistent perception-reasoning gap, showing models that excel in abstract inference often fail with fundamental visual grounding. While models like Gemini Pro achieve the highest zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuning the smaller Qwen2.5-VL 7B model on UDVideoQA bridges this gap, achieving performance comparable to proprietary systems. In VideoQGen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen3 Max generate the most relevant and complex questions, though all models exhibit limited linguistic diversity, underscoring the need for human-centric evaluation. The UDVideoQA suite, including the dataset, annotation tools, and benchmarks for both VideoQA and VideoQGen, provides a foundation for advancing robust, privacy-aware, and real-world multimodal reasoning.

Code available at https://github.com/BastienGimbert/SpriteToMesh", "summary": "We present SPRITETOMESH, a fully automatic pipeline for converting 2D game sprite images into triangle meshes compatible with skeletal animation frameworks such as Spine2D. Creating animation-ready meshes is traditionally a tedious manual process requiring artists to carefully place vertices along visual boundaries, a task that typically takes 15-60 minutes per sprite. Our method addresses this through a hybrid learned-algorithmic approach. A segmentation network (EfficientNet-B0 encoder with U-Net decoder) trained on over 100,000 sprite-mask pairs from 172 games achieves an IoU of 0.87, providing accurate binary masks from arbitrary input images. From these masks, we extract exterior contour vertices using Douglas-Peucker simplification with adaptive arc subdivision, and interior vertices along visual boundaries detected via bilateral-filtered multi-channel Canny edge detection with contour-following placement. Delaunay triangulation with mask-based centroid filtering produces the final mesh. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that direct vertex position prediction via neural network heatmap regression is fundamentally not viable for this task: the heatmap decoder consistently fails to converge (loss plateau at 0.061) while the segmentation decoder trains normally under identical conditions. We attribute this to the inherently artistic nature of vertex placement - the same sprite can be meshed validly in many different ways.

Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix.

Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods.

In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HVG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8863\u7269\u8936\u76b1\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "HVG\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a(i) \u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u8c03\u5236\uff0c(ii) \u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c(iii) \u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u65f6\u7a7a\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "HVG\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76844D\u4eba\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "HVG\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect. We demonstrate both tools using in vitro reconstituted membrane systems containing deformable vesicles with complex geometries, enabling automatic quantitative analysis of membrane contact sites and remodeling events such as invagination. While demonstrated here on cryo-ET membrane data, the combined approach is applicable to ROI detection and surface analysis in broader scientific imaging contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "TomoROIS-SurfORA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u5272\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684ROI\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ROI\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u95f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u819c\uff09\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u5f62\u72b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86TomoROIS-SurfORA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u6b65\u6846\u67b6\uff1aTomoROIS\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884cROI\u5206\u5272\uff0cSurfORA\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u5916\u91cd\u6784\u819c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u819c\u63a5\u89e6\u4f4d\u70b9\u548c\u91cd\u5851\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5185\u9677\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "TomoROIS-SurfORA\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u5b50\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684ROI\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}
