The quality of the filtering will be compared with other common animation filtering techniques using an example case drawn fromthe LaFAN1 dataset, showing that the resulting animation is replayed with higher fidelity by evaluating the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS) for each setup.

We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training.

This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \\emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $\u0398(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $\u03a9(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.\n  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = \u03a9(n \\cdot \u03ba)$, where $\u03ba$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\\cdot n\\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(\u03c9+\\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, where $\u03c9$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(\u03c9+\\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.

The two main problems we are interested in are the \\emph{Optimal Decision Tree} and \\emph{Set Cover}. We study these two fundamental tasks under precedence constraints, that is, if a test (or set) $X$ is a predecessor of $Y$, then in any feasible decision tree $X$ needs to be an ancestor of $Y$ (or respectively, if $Y$ is added to set cover, then so must be $X$). For the Optimal Decision Tree we consider two optimization criteria: worst case identification time (height of the tree) or the average identification time. Similarly, for the Set Cover we study two cost measures: the size of the cover or the average cover time.\n  Our approach is to develop a number of algorithmic reductions, where an approximation algorithm for one problem provides an approximation for another via a black-box usage of a procedure for the former. En route we introduce other optimization problems either to complete the `reduction landscape' or because they hold the essence of combinatorial structure of our problems. The latter is brought by a problem of finding a maximum density precedence closed subfamily, where the density is defined as the ratio of the number of items the family covers to its size. By doing so we provide $\\cO^*(\\sqrt{m})$-approximation algorithms for all of the aforementioned problems. The picture is complemented by a number of hardness reductions that provide $o(m^{1/12-\u03b5})$-inapproximability results for the decision tree and covering problems. Besides giving a complete set of results for general precedence constraints, we also provide polylogarithmic approximation guarantees for two most typically studied and applicable precedence types, outforests and inforests. By providing corresponding hardness results, we show these results to be tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u4f18\u5148\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86O*(\u221am)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5148\u7c7b\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u6709\u4f18\u5148\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u76d2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e3a\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5927\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u5c01\u95ed\u5b50\u65cf\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86O*(\u221am)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86o(m^(1/12-\u03b5))\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5916\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u5185\u68ee\u6797\u4f18\u5148\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7d27\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u4f18\u5148\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86O*(\u221am)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u7d27\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5148\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5916\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u5185\u68ee\u6797\uff09\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

In this work, we present persistent monitoring tasks for HUAUVs by combining Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning to enable cross-domain adaptability. Our approach employs a shared DRL architecture trained on Lidar sensor data (on air) and Sonar data (underwater), demonstrating the feasibility of a unified policy for both environments.

In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.\n  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.\n  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\\times$ on our in-house inference system.

In this paper, we introduce $\u0394^\\ell$-DRESS, which applies $\\ell$ levels of iterated node deletion to the DRESS continuous structural refinement framework. $\u0394^\\ell$-DRESS runs Original-DRESS on all $\\binom{n}{\\ell}$ subgraphs obtained by removing $\\ell$ nodes, and compares the resulting histograms. We show empirically on the canonical CFI benchmark family that Original-DRESS ($\u0394^0$) already distinguishes $\\text{CFI}(K_3)$ (requiring 2-WL), and that each additional deletion level extends the range by one WL level: $\u0394^1$ reaches 3-WL, $\u0394^2$ reaches 4-WL, and $\u0394^3$ reaches 5-WL, distinguishing CFI pairs over $K_n$ for $n = 3, \\ldots, 6$.

While fusing inertial reading with satellite positioning in an extended Kalman filter provides short-term navigation continuity, low-cost inertial sensors suffer from rapid error accumulation during prolonged outages. Existing information aiding approaches, such as the non-holonomic constraint, impose rigid equality assumptions on vehicle motion that may be violated under dynamic urban driving conditions, limiting their robustness precisely when aiding is most needed. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch information aiding framework that fuses equality and inequality motion constraints through a variance-weighted scheme, requiring only a software modification to an existing navigation filter with no additional sensors or hardware. The proposed method is evaluated on four publicly available urban datasets featuring various inertial sensors, road conditions, and dynamics, covering a total duration of 4.3 hours of recorded data. Under Full GNSS availability, the method reduces vertical position error by 16.7% and improves altitude accuracy by 50.1% over the standard non-holonomic constraint. Under GNSS-denied conditions, vertical drift is reduced by 24.2% and altitude accuracy improves by 20.2%. These results demonstrate that replacing hard motion equality assumptions with physically motivated inequality bounds is a practical and cost-free strategy for improving navigation resilience, continuity, and drift robustness without relying on additional sensors, map data, or learned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u548c\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u7e41\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f66\u8f86\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u65ad\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u975e\u5b8c\u6574\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5bfc\u822a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5728GNSS\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1116.7%\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad850.1%\uff1b\u5728GNSS\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c1124.2%\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad820.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6848\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5bfc\u822a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728GNSS\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u7528\u548cGNSS\u7f3a\u5931\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce HorizonForge, a unified framework that reconstructs scenes as editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, enabling fine-grained 3D manipulation and language-driven vehicle insertion. Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization. To standardize evaluation, we further propose HorizonSuite, a comprehensive benchmark spanning ego- and agent-level editing tasks such as trajectory modifications and object manipulation. Extensive experiments show that Gaussian-Mesh representation delivers substantially higher fidelity than alternative 3D representations, and that temporal priors from video diffusion are essential for coherent synthesis. Combining these findings, HorizonForge establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, achieving an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second best state-of-the-art method.

While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9MoE-based LLM\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5747\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728MoE\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9MoE-based LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bf7\u6c42\u7ea7\u3001\u5f15\u64ce\u7ea7\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728100\u591a\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6846\u67b6vLLM\uff0cTTFT\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e17.8%\uff0cTPOT\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e13.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eMoE\u7684LLM\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002"}}

Most existing studies adopt a branch-and-bound framework, which recursively expands a partial biclique with a vertex until no further vertices can be added. Equipped with a basic pivot selection strategy, all state-of-the-art methods have a worst-case time complexity no better than $O(m\\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^n)$}, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of edges and vertices in the graph, respectively. In this paper, we introduce a new branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm \\texttt{IPS}. In \\texttt{IPS}, we relax the strict stopping criterion of existing methods by allowing termination when all maximal bicliques within the current branch can be outputted in the time proportional to the number of maximal bicliques inside, reducing the total number of branches required. Second, to fully unleash the power of the new termination condition, we propose an improved pivot selection strategy, which well aligns with the new termination condition to achieve better theoretical and practical performance. Formally, \\texttt{IPS} improves the worst-case time complexity to $O(m\\cdot \u03b1^n + n\\cdot \u03b2)$, where $\u03b1(\\approx 1.3954)$ is the largest positive root of $x^4-2x-1=0$ and $\u03b2$ represents the number of maximal bicliques in the graph, respectively. This result surpasses that of all existing algorithms given that $\u03b1$ is strictly smaller than $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\u03b2$ is at most $(\\sqrt{2})^n-2$ theoretically. Furthermore, we apply an inclusion-exclusion-based framework to boost the performance of \\texttt{IPS}, improving the worst-case time complexity to $O(n\\cdot \u03b3^2\\cdot\u03b1^\u03b3+ \u03b3\\cdot \u03b2)$ for large sparse graphs ($\u03b3$ is a parameter satisfying $\u03b3\\ll n$ for sparse graphs).", "AI": {"tldr": "IPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u67a2\u8f74\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u53cc\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5927\u53cc\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u574f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "IPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5bbd\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u67a2\u8f74\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6700\u5927\u53cc\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5305\u542b-\u6392\u9664\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "IPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u6700\u574f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece$O(m\\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^n)$\u63d0\u5347\u81f3$O(m\\cdot \\alpha^n + n\\cdot \\beta)$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$\\alpha$\u7ea6\u4e3a1.3954\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a$O(n\\cdot \\gamma^2\\cdot\\alpha^\\gamma+ \\gamma\\cdot \\beta)$\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5IPS\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u53cc\u56e2\u679a\u4e3e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u574f\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

At each iteration, the algorithm constructs a local inverse model of the robot and rope by solving a quadratic program to propagate task-space errors into action updates.

Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro).

The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text).

Crucially dependent on resilient mobile network connectivity, they serve as invaluable assets for tasks like rapid victim localization and the exploration of hazardous, otherwise unreachable areas. However, their reliance on battery power and the need for persistent, low-latency communication limit operational time and mobility. To address this, and considering the evolving capabilities of 5G/6G networks, we propose a novel SAR framework that includes Mission Planning and Mission Execution phases and that optimizes robot deployment. By considering parameters such as the exploration area size, terrain elevation, robot fleet size, communication-influenced energy profiles, desired exploration rate, and target response time, our framework determines the minimum number of robots required and their optimal paths to ensure effective coverage and timely data backhaul over mobile networks. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs between number of robots, explored area, and response time for wheeled and quadruped robots.

This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering.

In contrast, the practically relevant non-clairvoyant model assumes that the processing time of a job is unknown at its arrival, and is only revealed when it completes. Non-clairvoyant flow time minimization does not admit algorithms with a constant competitive ratio. Consequently, the problem has been studied under speed augmentation (JACM'00) or with predicted processing times (STOC'21, SODA'22) to attain constant guarantees.\n  In this paper, we consider $\u03b1$-clairvoyant scheduling, where the scheduler learns the processing time of a job once it completes an $\u03b1$-fraction of its processing time. This naturally interpolates between clairvoyant scheduling ($\u03b1=0$) and non-clairvoyant scheduling ($\u03b1=1$). By elegantly fusing two traditional algorithms, we propose a scheduling rule with a competitive ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{1-\u03b1})$ whenever $0 \\leq \u03b1< 1$. As $\u03b1$ increases, our competitive guarantee transitions nicely (up to constants) between the previously established bounds for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant flow time minimization.

However, modeling and planning contact-rich interactions for soft robots remain challenging: dense contact candidates along the body create redundant constraints and rank-deficient LCPs, while the disparity between high stiffness and low friction introduces severe ill-conditioning. Existing approaches rely on problem-specific approximations or penalty-based treatments. This letter presents a unified complementarity-based framework for soft-robot contact modeling and planning that brings contact modeling, manipulation, and planning into a unified, physically consistent formulation. We develop a robust Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) model tailored to discretized soft robots and address these challenges with a three-stage conditioning pipeline: inertial rank selection to remove redundant contacts, Ruiz equilibration to correct scale disparity and ill-conditioning, and lightweight Tikhonov regularization on normal blocks. Building on the same formulation, we introduce a kinematically guided warm-start strategy that enables dynamic trajectory optimization through contact using Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) and demonstrate its effectiveness on contact-rich ball manipulation tasks.

Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARLArena\u6846\u67b6\u548cSAMPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ARL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65e9\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9f13\u821e\uff0c\u4f46ARL\u4ecd\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u548c\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51faARLArena\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u68c0\u67e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002ARLArena\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e72\u51c0\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SAMPO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7f13\u89e3ARL\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAMPO\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aARL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.\n  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548cAI\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u7f55\u89c1\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6216\u975e\u5178\u578b\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u74f6\u9888\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5408\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e0\u83cc\u533a\u57df\u8fdd\u89c4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5931\u8bef\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5e38\u89c4\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684FVD/LPIPS\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684SSIM/PSNR\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe\u523070.13%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5730\u5408\u6210\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5ba4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u652f\u6301\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Additionally, we show that $\u03a9(1/(\\varepsilon \\|\u03bc\\|_2))$ is indeed a per-instance lower bound for estimating the norm of a distribution $\u03bc$ by sampling (even for non-unbiased estimators).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504fL2\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u8303\u6570\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "Batu\u548cCanonne\uff08FOCS 2017\uff09\u5bf9L2\u8303\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1L2\u8303\u6570\u672c\u8eab\u65f6\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504f\u7684L2\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u03a9(1/(\u03b5\u2016\u03bc\u20162))\u662f\u6bcf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u504f\u7684L2\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u03a9(1/(\u03b5\u2016\u03bc\u20162))\u662f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u03bc\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6bcf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0b\u754c\u3002"}}

This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion.

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference.

Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.\n  Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.\n  These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently.

The goal is to minimize the overhead of an online algorithm over the optimal offline algorithm. Three versions of this setting were considered: Instantly-committing schedulers that must assign tasks to machines immediately and irrevocably, Eventually-committing schedulers whose assignments are irrevocable but can occur anytime after a task arrives, and Never-committing schedulers that can interrupt and restart a task on a different machine. In the Instantly-committing model, Sheffield and Westover showed that the optimal competitive ratio is equal to 2, while in the Eventually-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.618, 1.678], and in the Never-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.366, 1.5] (SPAA '24, ITCS '25). In the latter two models, the exact optimal competitive ratios were left as open problems, moreover Kuszmaul and Westover (SPAA '24) conjectured that the lower bound in the Eventually-committing model is tight.\n  In this paper we resolve this problem by providing tight bounds for the competitive ratios in the Eventually-committing and Never-committing models. For Eventually-committing, we prove Kuszmaul and Westover's conjecture by giving an algorithm achieving a competitive ratio equal to the lower bound of $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\approx 1.618$.

Lang., Vol. 10, OOPSLA1)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) for code editing have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent empirical studies reveal a fundamental disconnect between technical accuracy and developer productivity. Despite their strong benchmark performance, developers complete tasks 19% slower when using AI assistance, with over 68.81% of recommendations disrupting their mental flow. This misalignment stems from the use of static commit snapshots that lack temporal information, causing models to optimize for end results rather than the incremental, context-sensitive steps that align with developers' natural reasoning process.\n  To bridge this gap, we present EditFlow, which benchmarks and optimizes subsequent code edit recommendation systems through the reconstruction of developer editing flows. EditFlow addresses three key challenges. First, collecting edit-order data that reflects developers' flow is inherently difficult: manual annotation introduces prohibitive overhead, while development logs capture only single trajectories instead of all plausible editing flows.

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ASIR Courage Model\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u76f8\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5229\u76ca\u6216\u653f\u7b56\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u76f8\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5171\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u771f\u76f8\u62ab\u9732\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0flambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi\u91cf\u5316\u4fc3\u8fdb\u529b\u4e0e\u6291\u5236\u529b\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u6c89\u9ed8\u548cAI\u5728\u504f\u597d\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u771f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u6269\u5c55\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5206\u6b67\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "ASIR Courage Model\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u771f\u76f8\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MMLoP} (\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Lo}w-Rank \\textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \\textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\\% on base-to-novel generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMLoP\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u970011.5K\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u3001\u653e\u5f03\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMLoP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u8c03\u8282\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3001\u5747\u5300\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMLoP\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u5230\u65b0\u9896\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8c03\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe\u523079.70%\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLoP\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u4ec511.5K\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

To address the high computational cost and privacy challenges in conventional FL with neural networks (NN) for resource-constrained users, we propose a novel FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem.

The reduction that is our main result follows from an analysis similar to Bertsimas and Sim (2003) except that dualization is applied to the terms of a min-max objective rather than to a linear objective function. Our result may be surprising considering that heuristic and exact integer programming based methods have been developed in the literature for solving the two-machine flowshop problem. We conclude by showing a logarithmic factor improvement in the overall running time implied by a naive reduction to nominal problems in the case of two machines and three machines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u7f6e\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u8f66\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7f6e\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u8f66\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u6700\u591a\u6709\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8eBertsimas\u548cSim\uff082003\uff09\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6700\u5c0f-\u6700\u5927\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9879\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u5076\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u53f0\u548c\u4e09\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540d\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u9c81\u68d2\u7f6e\u6362\u6d41\u6c34\u8f66\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u53f0\u548c\u4e09\u53f0\u673a\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Vehicles must maneuver safely near animals and fragile structures while coping with currents, variable illumination and limited sensing. Previous approaches simplify these problems by leveraging soft materials and bioinspired swimming designs, but such platforms remain limited in terms of deployable autonomy. Here we present a sea turtle-inspired autonomous underwater robot that closed the gap between bioinspired locomotion and field-ready autonomy through a tightly integrated, vision-driven control stack. The robot combines robust depth-heading stabilization with obstacle avoidance and target-centric control, enabling it to track and interact with moving objects in complex terrain. We validate the robot in controlled pool experiments and in a live coral reef exhibit at the New England Aquarium, demonstrating stable operation and reliable tracking of fast-moving marine animals and human divers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first integrated biomimetic robotic system, combining novel hardware, control, and field experiments, deployed to track and monitor real marine animals in their natural environment. During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode. Together, these results establish a practical route toward soft-rigid hybrid, bioinspired underwater robots capable of minimally disruptive exploration and close-range monitoring in sensitive ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d77\u9f9f\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u6211\u4eec\u89c2\u5bdf\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u63a7\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d77\u9f9f\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6-\u822a\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u514d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u5bc6\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5806\u6808\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u73b0\u573a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6c60\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d3b\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u5c55\u89c8\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u79fb\u52a8\u6d77\u6d0b\u52a8\u7269\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f5c\u6c34\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u8ba9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe91%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u6d77\u6d0b\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4eff\u751f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u5e72\u6270\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Lisi"], "title": "fEDM+: A Risk-Based Fuzzy Ethical Decision Making Framework with Principle-Level Explainability and Pluralistic Validation", "comment": null, "summary": "In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity.

To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "IOAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bca\u65adHPC I/O\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740HPC\u5b58\u50a8\u6808\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528HPC\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u7684I/O\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7531\u4e8eI/O\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u963b\u788d\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "IOAgent\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u5668\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684Darshan\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65adI/O\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cIOAgent\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5339\u914d\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684I/O\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u53d7\u7279\u5b9aLLMs\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4e13\u6709\u8fd8\u662f\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u90fd\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "IOAgent\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65adHPC I/O\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742HPC I/O\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u529b\u52a9\u624b\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional approaches that continuously stream raw inertial data to a microcontroller for classification, the proposed system executes activity recognition at the sensor level using the embedded Machine Learning Core (MLC) of the STMicroelectronics LSM6DSV16X IMU, allowing the host microcontroller to remain in a low-power state and read only the recognized activity label from IMU registers. While the system generalizes to multiple human activities, this paper focuses on three representative locomotion modes - stance, level walking, and stair ascent - using data collected from adult participants. A lightweight decision-tree model was configured and deployed for on-sensor execution using ST MEMS Studio, enabling continuous operation without custom machine learning code on the microcontroller. During operation, the IMU asserts an interrupt when motion or a new classification is detected; the microcontroller wakes, reads the MLC output registers, and forwards the inferred mode to the exoskeleton controller. This interrupt-driven, on-sensor inference architecture reduces computation and communication overhead while preserving battery energy and improving robustness in distinguishing level walking from stair ascent for torque-assist control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eIMU\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fMLC\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684HAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u80a2\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528STMicroelectronics LSM6DSV16X IMU\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6838\u5fc3\uff08MLC\uff09\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u6267\u884c\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e2d\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7535\u6c60\u7eed\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e73\u5730\u884c\u8d70\u4e0e\u697c\u68af\u722c\u5347\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u533a\u5206\u5e73\u5730\u884c\u8d70\u548c\u697c\u68af\u722c\u5347\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7684\u626d\u77e9\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the effect and choice of the execution horizon - the number of actions to be executed from each predicted chunk - remains underexplored. In this work, we first show that varying the execution horizon leads to substantial performance deviations, with performance initially improving and then declining as the horizon increases. To uncover the reasons, we analyze the cross- and self-attention weights in flow-based VLAs and reveal two key phenomena: (i) intra-chunk actions attend invariantly to vision-language tokens, limiting adaptability to environmental changes; and (ii) the initial and terminal action tokens serve as stable anchors, forming latent centers around which intermediate actions are organized. Motivated by these insights, we interpret action self-attention weights as a proxy for the model's predictive limit and propose AutoHorizon, the first test-time method that dynamically estimates the execution horizon for each predicted action chunk to adapt to changing perceptual conditions. Across simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, AutoHorizon is performant, incurs negligible computational overhead, and generalizes across diverse tasks and flow-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoHorizon\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u63ed\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u91ce\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u91ce\u9009\u62e9\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a(i) \u5757\u5185\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b(ii) \u521d\u59cb\u548c\u7ec8\u6b62\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u8bb0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6781\u9650\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AutoHorizon\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "AutoHorizon\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoHorizon\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMTailor\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u8bbaI/O\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u90fd\u4f1a\u5b9a\u671f\u5b58\u50a8\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5c42\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLMTailor\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u5c42\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u590d\u5408\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3002", "result": "LLMTailor\u53ef\u5c06\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c114.3\u500d\uff08Llama3.1-8B\uff09\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed2.8\u500d\uff08Qwen2.5-7B\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMTailor\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field.

Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.\n  We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.\n  Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an \"optimally readable\" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.\n  These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u91cd\u6784\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u6784\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528GPT5.1\u5bf9230\u4e2aJava\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7247\u6bb5\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u5c06\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u6ce8\u91ca\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u67e5\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1.\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u5448\u73b0\u521d\u59cb\u91cd\u6784\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u8d8b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5bf9\u201c\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u8bfb\u201d\u4ee3\u7801\u7248\u672c\u6709\u5185\u5728\u7406\u89e3\uff1b2.\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff1b3.\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u8f7b\u5fae\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u6784\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u548cLLM\u91cd\u6784\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations.

However, existing global tree height maps provide only static snapshots and do not capture temporal forest dynamics, which are essential for accurate carbon accounting. We introduce ECHOSAT, a global and temporally consistent tree height map at 10 m resolution spanning multiple years. To this end, we resort to multi-sensor satellite data to train a specialized vision transformer model, which performs pixel-level temporal regression. A self-supervised growth loss regularizes the predictions to follow growth curves that are in line with natural tree development, including gradual height increases over time, but also abrupt declines due to forest loss events such as fires. Our experimental evaluation shows that our model improves state-of-the-art accuracies in the context of single-year predictions.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%. Furthermore, real-world evaluations across 8 long-horizon tasks demonstrate an average success rate of 85%.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts.

Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support.

While model-based controllers can achieve high motion accuracy under nominal conditions, their robustness and responsiveness often degrade in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility. We present a learning-based control framework that enables efficient acquisition of coordinated rotor-joint behaviors for reaching target poses in the $SE(3)$ space. To achieve reliable sim-to-real transfer while preserving motion accuracy, we integrate system identification with minimal and physically consistent domain randomization.

We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance.

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios.

However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts.

However, the fixed difficulty distribution of datasets limits the performance ceiling of the trained control policies. Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\\% compared to the baseline.

Sometimes, a feasible plan may not even exist, and identifying such infeasibilities is useful to determine when requirements need adjustment. Common planning approaches focus on efficient one-shot planning in feasible cases rather than updating domains or detecting infeasibility. We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates.

We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA.

Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating a forward jump over a 0.12 m obstacle and a vertical jump reaching 0.5 m.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408NMPC\u548cDE\u7684\u8f6e\u817f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6e\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u817f\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6e\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\u56e0\u989d\u5916\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMPC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\uff08DE\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u8df3\u8dc3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u8d8a0.12\u7c73\u969c\u788d\u7684\u524d\u8df3\u548c0.5\u7c73\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c0f\u578b\u8f6e\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408NMPC\u548cDE\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u3002"}}

A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001VPR\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u671f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u904d\u5386\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u76ee\u6807Local Recall@1\u6c34\u5e73\u548cRecall Achievement Rate\uff08RAR\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u672c\u5730\u53ec\u56de\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001VPR\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Modality Diffusion Policy (ADM-DP), a framework that integrates vision, tactile, and graph-based (multi-agent pose) modalities for coordinated control. ADM-DP introduces four key innovations. First, an enhanced visual encoder merges RGB and point-cloud features via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation to enrich perception. Second, a tactile-guided grasping strategy uses Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) feedback to detect insufficient contact and trigger corrective grasp refinement, improving grasp stability. Third, a graph-based collision encoder leverages shared tool center point (TCP) positions of multiple agents as structured kinematic context to maintain spatial awareness and reduce inter-agent interference. Fourth, an Adaptive Modality Attention Mechanism (AMAM) dynamically re-weights modalities according to task context, enabling flexible fusion. For scalability and modularity, a decoupled training paradigm is employed in which agents learn independent policies while sharing spatial information. This maintains low interdependence between agents while retaining collective awareness. Across seven multi-agent tasks, ADM-DP achieves 12-25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies show the greatest improvements in tasks requiring multiple sensory modalities, validating our adaptive fusion strategy and demonstrating its robustness for diverse manipulation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADM-DP\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADM-DP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u56fe\u57fa\u78b0\u649e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u9879\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cADM-DP\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534712-25%\u3002", "conclusion": "ADM-DP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged.

This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data.

In this work, we present Tacmap, a high-fidelity, computationally efficient tactile simulation framework anchored in volumetric penetration depth. Our key insight is to bridge the tactile sim-to-real gap by unifying both domains through a shared deform map representation. Specifically, we compute 3D intersection volumes as depth maps in simulation, while in the real world, we employ an automated data-collection rig to learn a robust mapping from raw tactile images to ground-truth depth maps. By aligning simulation and real-world in this unified geometric space, Tacmap minimizes domain shift while maintaining physical consistency.

Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to \"think with images\" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u672c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u6c60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u90fd\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLVLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff08TreeBench\u63d0\u534716.5%-29.5%\uff0cRH-Bench\u63d0\u534713.7% RH-AUC\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u76d1\u7763\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

Although imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for generating natural robotic movements, simply replicating joint angle trajectories fails to capture the underlying principles of human motion. This study proposes a Gait Divergence Analysis Framework (GDAF), a unified biomechanical evaluation framework that systematically quantifies kinematic and kinetic discrepancies between humans and bipedal robots. We apply GDAF to systematically compare human and humanoid locomotion across 28 walking speeds. To enable reproducible analysis, we collect and release a speed-continuous humanoid locomotion dataset from a state-of-the-art humanoid controller. We further provide an open-source implementation of GDAF, including analysis, visualization, and MuJoCo-based tools, enabling quantitative, interpretable, and reproducible biomechanical analysis of humanoid locomotion. Results demonstrate that despite visually human-like motion generated by modern humanoid controllers, significant biomechanical divergence persists across speeds. Robots exhibit systematic deviations in gait symmetry, energy distribution, and joint coordination, indicating that substantial room remains for improving the biomechanical fidelity and energetic efficiency of humanoid locomotion. This work provides a quantitative benchmark for evaluating humanoid locomotion and offers data and versatile tools to support the development of more human-like and energetically efficient locomotion controllers.

Tool-Expertise-Aware Chest X-ray Agent with Multimodal Agentic Learning", "comment": "11 pages", "summary": "AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines.

Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively.

Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm.

However, existing End-to-End (E2E) planning methods often simplify the parking task into a geometric path regression problem, neglecting explicit modeling of the vehicle's kinematic state. This \"dimensionality deficiency\" easily leads to physically infeasible trajectories and deviates from real human driving behavior, particularly at critical gear-shift points in multi-shot parking scenarios. In this paper, we propose SunnyParking, a novel dual-branch E2E architecture that achieves motion state awareness by jointly predicting spatial trajectories and discrete motion state sequences (e.g., forward/reverse). Additionally, we introduce a Fourier feature-based representation of target parking slots to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional bird's-eye view (BEV) approaches, enabling high-precision target interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates more robust and human-like trajectories in complex multi-shot parking scenarios, while significantly improving gear-shift point localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts.

To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks.

As a result, they often produce indistinct boundaries near vessels and show limited generalization under anatomical variability.We propose VasGuideNet, the first Couinaud segmentation framework explicitly guided by vascular topology. Specifically, skeletonized vessels, Euclidean distance transform (EDT)--derived geometry, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) connectivity are encoded into topology features using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). These features are then injected into a 3D encoder--decoder backbone via a cross-attention fusion module. To further improve inter-class separability and anatomical consistency, we introduce a Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) with a global memory bank.On Task08_HepaticVessel and our private LASSD dataset, VasGuideNet achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% with RVDs of 1.68 and 7.08, respectively. It consistently outperforms representative baselines including UNETR, Swin UNETR, and G-UNETR++, delivering higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for anatomically consistent segmentation.

Endpoint regulation is incorporated into trajectory sampling to stabilize terminal behavior, while a momentum-aware dynamics enforces consistent velocity and acceleration evolution across consecutive trajectory segments.

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria.

Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently.

At low speeds or large angles of attack, viscous effects and flow separation dominate, leading to drag-driven and damping-dominated dynamics. Accurately representing transitions between these regimes remains a fundamental challenge. This paper presents a hybrid aerodynamic modeling framework that integrates a fixed-wing Aerodynamic Coupling Model (ACM) and a Generalized Drag Model (GDM) using a learned neural network mixer with explicit physics-based regularization. The mixer enables smooth transitions between regimes while retaining explicit, physics-based aerodynamic representation. Model parameters are identified through a structured three-phase pipeline tailored for hybrid aerodynamic modeling. The proposed approach is validated on the RGBlimp platform through a large-scale experimental campaign comprising 1,320 real-world flight trajectories across 330 thruster and moving mass configurations, spanning a wide range of speeds and angles of attack. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model consistently outperforms single-model and predefined-mixer baselines, establishing a practical and robust aerodynamic modeling solution for winged blimps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6c14\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ffc\u548c\u963b\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ffc\u98de\u8247\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c14\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u5c0f\u653b\u89d2\u548c\u4f4e\u901f\u5927\u653b\u89d2\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u8fc7\u6e21\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6c14\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08ACM\uff09\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u963b\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff08GDM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6c14\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728RGBlimp\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1,320\u6761\u5b9e\u9645\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c330\u79cd\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u53ca\u79fb\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u7f6e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u6c14\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u7ffc\u6c14\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08ACM\uff09\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u963b\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff08GDM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ffc\u98de\u8247\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c14\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6df7\u5408\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases.

Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks. By grounding interaction in local geometry rather than demonstrations, LessMimic offers a scalable path toward humanoid robots that generalize, compose skills, and recover from failures in unstructured environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "LessMimic\u5229\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\uff08DF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u4ea4\u4e92\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u8003\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4ea4\u4e92\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "LessMimic\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\uff08DF\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u8868\u9762\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u8eab\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8fd0\u52a8\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u5148\u9a8c\uff08AIP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2aLessMimic\u7b56\u7565\u5728PickUp\u548cSitStand\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8680-100%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4ece0.4x\u52301.6x\uff09\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523062.1%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8fde\u7eed\u6267\u884c\u591a\u8fbe40\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u800c\u975e\u6f14\u793a\u4e0a\uff0cLessMimic\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u4ece\u5931\u8d25\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively.

We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data. We scale this approach with UniHand-Mix, a 7.5M video corpus (>2,000 hours) blending laboratory and in-the-wild footage. Experiments demonstrate that JALA generates more realistic hand motions in both controlled and unconstrained scenarios, significantly improving downstream robot manipulation performance in both simulation and real-world tasks.

Through in-depth analysis of LVLM activation patterns, we reveal two key findings: 1) truthfulness and visual perception capabilities predominantly engage different subsets of attention heads within the model architecture; and 2) truthfulness steering vectors vary significantly across different semantic contexts. Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach significantly enhances model performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDynamic Multimodal Activation Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u5411\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "1) \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2) \u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u65e0\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u6210\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve.

Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces.

In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%.

We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT.

However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction.

Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniHand\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u76844D\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5206\u79bb\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5229\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "method": "UniHand\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUniHand\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "UniHand\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration.

In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion.

However, enabling humanoid robots to perform natural and context-appropriate gaze shifts in unconstrained human--robot interaction (HRI) remains challenging, as it requires the coupling of cognitive attention mechanisms and biomimetic motion generation. In this work, we propose the Robot Gaze-Shift (RGS) framework, which integrates these two components into a unified pipeline. First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors.

However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions.

In robot swarms, measurements from different robots arrive asynchronously and with clock time-offsets. Although Continuous-Time (CT) formulations have proved effective for handling asynchronous measurements in single-robot SLAM and calibration, extending CT methods to multi-robot settings faces great challenges to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency, and high-frequency performance. Especially, existing CT methods suffer from the inherent query-time delay of unclamped B-splines and high computational cost. This paper proposes CT-RIO, a novel Continuous-Time Relative-Inertial Odometry framework. We employ Clamped Non-Uniform B-splines (C-NUBS) to represent robot states for the first time, eliminating the query-time delay. We further augment C-NUBS with closed-form extension and shrinkage operations that preserve the spline shape, making it suitable for online estimation and enabling flexible knot management. This flexibility leads to the concept of knot-keyknot strategy, which supports spline extension at high-frequency while retaining sparse keyknots for adaptive relative-motion modeling. We then formulate a sliding-window relative localization problem that operates purely on relative kinematics and inter-robot constraints. To meet the demanding computation required at swarm scale, we decompose the tightly-coupled optimization into robot-wise sub-problems and solve them in parallel using incremental asynchronous block coordinate descent. Extensive experiments show that CT-RIO converges from time-offsets as large as 263 ms to sub-millisecond within 3 s, and achieves RMSEs of 0.046 m and 1.8 \u00b0.

However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.\n  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.\n  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.\n  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.", "AI": {"tldr": "PatchDenoiser \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5757\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53bb\u566a\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5e38\u56e0\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u8fd0\u52a8\u6216\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u9650\u5236\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5757\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Mayo Low-Dose CT \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPatchDenoiser \u5728 PSNR \u548c SSIM \u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709 CNN \u548c GAN \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6 9 \u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6 27 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PatchDenoiser \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u566a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios.

However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC.

Existing learning-based policies often entangle these roles in a monolithic network, trading off global generalization against stable local refinement, while control-centric approaches typically assume a known task structure or learn only controller parameters rather than the structure itself. In this paper, we formalize a physically grounded interaction frame, an instantaneous local basis that decouples force regulation from motion execution, and propose a method to recover it from demonstrations. Based on this, we address both issues by proposing Force Policy, a global-local vision-force policy in which a global policy guides free-space actions using vision, and upon contact, a high-frequency local policy with force feedback estimates the interaction frame and executes hybrid force-position control for stable interaction. Real-world experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with more robust contact establishment, more accurate force regulation, and reliable generalization to novel objects with varied geometries and physical properties, ultimately improving both contact stability and execution quality.

To tackle these difficulties, we explore the integration of event cameras into the perception system, leveraging their advantages in low-light conditions, high-speed scenarios, and low power consumption. Specifically, we focus on Kilometer Marker Recognition (KMR), a critical task for autonomous metro localization under GNSS-denied conditions. In this context, we propose a robust baseline method based on a pre-trained RGB OCR foundation model, enhanced through multi-modal adaptation. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale RGB-Event dataset, EvMetro5K, containing 5,599 pairs of synchronized RGB-Event samples, split into 4,479 training and 1,120 testing samples.

However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures. In addition, a cascade attention fusion module is proposed to enhance multi-vehicle information integration.

This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. In particular, the image-level MoE is designed to capture global dependencies, while the token-level Sub-MoE focuses on local dependencies. Our model can selectively activate the most suitable expert networks for a given input, thereby enhancing generalization and transferability.

This paper presents a position-based flocking model that achieves persistent velocity alignment without velocity sensing. By approximating relative velocity differences from changes between current and initial relative positions and incorporating a time- and density-dependent alignment gain with a non-zero minimum threshold to maintain persistent alignment, the model sustains coherent collective motion over extended periods. Simulations with a collective of 50 agents demonstrate that the position-based flocking model attains faster and more sustained directional alignment and results in more compact formations than a velocity-alignment-based baseline. This position-based flocking model is particularly well-suited for real-world robotic swarms, where velocity measurements are unreliable, noisy, or unavailable.

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "SF3D-RGB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u54082D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "SF3D-RGB\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u521d\u59cb\u573a\u666f\u6d41\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSF3D-RGB\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SF3D-RGB\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u54082D\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86U-Net\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u6797\u5206\u5212\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793aDAP-CHM\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3ALS-CHM\uff0c\u4e14DTM\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u68ee\u6797\u6797\u5206\u5212\u5206\u5bf9\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e14\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30DAP-CHM\u548cDTM\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8865\u5145\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\uff08ALS-CHM\u3001DAP-CHM\u3001DAP-CHM+DTM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u632a\u5a01\u4e1c\u5357\u90e8\u516d\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u8fdb\u884c\u5e02\u7ea7\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57280.90-0.91\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6797\u5206\u5212\u5206\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1DAP-CHMs\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eALS-CHMs\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14DTM\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684ALS\u548cDAP\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.\n  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy).", "AI": {"tldr": "TranX-Adapter\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u89e3\u51b3AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u4f2a\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u7c7b\u5185\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTranX-Adapter\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u878d\u5408\uff08\u5229\u7528Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u672c\u77e9\u9635\uff09\u548cX-Fusion\uff08\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cc\u5411\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbMLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u51c6AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTranX-Adapter\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u6700\u9ad8+6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9002\u914d\u5668TranX-Adapter\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u878d\u5408\u548cX-Fusion\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86AIGI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment.

Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence).

Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures.

However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance.

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy.

Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $\u03c0^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model.

SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation.

LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning.

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks.

To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \\underline{\\textbf{s}}ingle \\underline{\\textbf{r}}andom \\underline{\\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \\underline{\\textbf{meta}}-learning with \\underline{\\textbf{f}}eature \\underline{\\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\\%, 4.71\\%, and 2.38\\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMeta-FC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfSRD\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u968f\u673a\u5931\u771f\uff08SRD\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5931\u771f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6279\u6b21\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08Meta-FC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u6784\u5efa\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u79cd\u5931\u771f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u201c\u672a\u77e5\u201d\u5931\u771f\u7528\u4e8e\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMeta-FC\u76f8\u6bd4SRD\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5931\u771f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta-FC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6c34\u5370\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u5931\u771f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.59%\u30014.71%\u548c2.38%\u3002"}}

However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy.

Empowering Users with Actionable Feedback", "comment": "Accepted @ CVPR 2026. Project page: https://laitifranz.github.io/MemCoach/", "summary": "Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores.

Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness.

Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models.

While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba promise linear complexity, their pixel-serial scanning remains a fundamental bottleneck for the millions of pixels in UHD content. We ask: must we process every pixel to understand the image? This paper introduces C$^2$SSM, a visual state space model that breaks this taboo by shifting from pixel-serial to cluster-serial scanning. Our core discovery is that the rich feature distribution of a UHD image can be distilled into a sparse set of semantic centroids via a neural-parameterized mixture model. C$^2$SSM leverages this to reformulate global modeling into a novel dual-path process: it scans and reasons over a handful of cluster centers, then diffuses the global context back to all pixels through a principled similarity distribution, all while a lightweight modulator preserves fine details.

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence.

However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning.

To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details.

We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM.

However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%.

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance.

However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential.

Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks.

To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing.

Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

We revisit this challenge from a cross-scale distribution transition perspective and propose CASR, a simple yet highly efficient cyclic SR framework that reformulates ultra-magnification as a sequence of in-distribution scale transitions. This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.", "AI": {"tldr": "CASR\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff08SDAM\u548cSARM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u653e\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08ASISR\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CASR\u91c7\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SDAM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u805a\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548cSARM\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u548cLR\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9891\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "CASR\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u653e\u5927\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u7a0b\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CASR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u653e\u5927\u3002"}}

At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step.

Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing.

Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Neu-PiG \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u52a8\u60013D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6f5c\u5728\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MLP\u89e3\u7801\u6bcf\u5e27\u76846-DoF\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Sobolev\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeu-PiG \u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb60\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Neu-PiG \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u65e0\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}
