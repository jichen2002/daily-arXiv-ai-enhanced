Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exacerbates this trend by producing LRs rapidly but often at the expense of quality, rigor, and transparency. At the same time, secondary studies often fail to share underlying data and artifacts, limiting replication and reuse. This paper introduces EmpiRE-Compass, a neuro-symbolic dashboard designed to lower barriers for accessing, replicating, and reusing LR data. Its overarching goal is to demonstrate how LRs can become more sustainable by semantically structuring their underlying data in research knowledge graphs (RKGs) and by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for easy and dynamic access, replication, and reuse. Building on two RE use cases, we developed EmpiRE-Compass with a modular system design and workflows for curated and custom competency questions. The dashboard is freely available online, accompanied by a demonstration video. To manage operational costs, a limit of 25 requests per IP address per day applies to the default LLM (GPT-4o mini). All source code and documentation are released as an open-source project to foster reuse, adoption, and extension. EmpiRE-Compass provides three core capabilities: (1) Exploratory visual analytics for curated competency questions; (2) Neuro-symbolic synthesis for custom competency questions; and (3) Reusable knowledge with all queries, analyses, and results openly available. By unifying RKGs and LLMs in a neuro-symbolic dashboard, EmpiRE-Compass advances sustainable LRs in RE, SE, and beyond. It lowers technical barriers, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and enables collaborative, continuously updated, and reusable LRs", "AI": {"tldr": "EmpiRE-Compass\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff09\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u4ea7\u51fa\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u5171\u4eab\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\u5de5\u7a0b\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4eea\u8868\u76d8\u7ed3\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "EmpiRE-Compass\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6587\u6863\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "EmpiRE-Compass\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

In this experience report, I aim to highlight that peer review is a practice that demands both scientific care for quality and collegial welfare for the joint progress and well-being of all peers involved, including authors, co-reviewers, workshop or conference organizers, and journal editors. Drawing on my ten years of experience in academia, I propose the ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer, grounded in the two core values: Scientific care and collegial welfare. Through reflection shaped by professional exchanges with colleagues, consideration of literature, and an examination of both self-authored and received reviews, I formulated an accompanying guideline with 16 practical recommendations to guide reviewers in their actions to achieve these two values. The ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer and its accompanying guideline help reviewers in upholding high scientific standards and conducting peer review in a constructive, supportive, respectful, and timely manner. They demonstrate that scientific rigor and empathy are complementary forces that promote impactful peer review practice. By placing scientific care and collegial welfare at the core of peer review, this experience report reaffirms the importance of scientific rigor while also advocating for greater attention to empathy. It invites reviewers to reconsider their role not merely as gatekeepers but as partners in the academic journey of each peer involved.

We propose EyeLayer, a lightweight attention-augmentation module that incorporates human eye-gaze patterns, as a proxy of human expertise, into LLM-based code summarization. EyeLayer models human attention during code reading via a Multimodal Gaussian Mixture, redistributing token embeddings based on learned parameters (\u03bc_i, \u03c3_i^2) that capture where and how intensively developers focus. This design enables learning generalizable attention priors from eye-tracking data and incorporating them into LLMs seamlessly, without disturbing existing representations. We evaluate EyeLayer across diverse model families (i.e., LLaMA-3.2, Qwen3, and CodeBERT) covering different scales and architectures. EyeLayer consistently outperforms strong fine-tuning baselines across standard metrics, achieving gains of up to 13.17% on BLEU-4.

We introduce a three-pass structurally lossless trimming algorithm that preserves every user message and assistant response verbatim while reducing token counts by a mean of 20% and up to 86% for sessions with significant overhead by stripping mechanical bloat such as raw tool outputs, base64 images, and metadata. A single-user case-study evaluation across 76 real-world coding sessions demonstrates that trimming remains economically viable under prompt caching, with the strongest gains in mixed tool-use sessions, which average 39% reduction and reach break-even within 10 turns.

Jonathan Chao"], "title": "Dynamic Hierarchical Birkhoff-von Neumann Decomposition for All-to-All GPU Communication", "comment": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "All-to-all GPU communication is a critical bottleneck in large-scale training clusters, where completion time is constrained by per-port bandwidth and can be severely impacted by traffic skew across GPUs and network interface cards (NICs). This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.\n  We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach.

We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps. Across diverse case studies and large edit sweeps, TopoEdit produces intention-aligned modifications that better preserve mechanical performance and avoid catastrophic failure modes compared to direct density-space edits, while generating edited candidates in sub-second diffusion time per sample.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoEdit\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u62d3\u6251\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u5c40\u90e8\u4fee\u6539\u4ecd\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u8fd0\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u53c8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "method": "TopoEdit\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u589e\u52a0\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91-\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u7ba1\u9053\u6ce8\u5165\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d6\u52a8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u58f3-\u586b\u5145\u683c\u5b50\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u65e0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u533a\u57df\u5f3a\u5236\u3002", "result": "TopoEdit\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u68b0\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoEdit\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u540e\u671f\u7f16\u8f91\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Although classical data association approaches such as JPDA are well suited for dynamic targets, they are less effective for static objects observed intermittently and with heterogeneous uncertainties, where motion models provide minimal discriminative with respect to clutter. In this paper, we propose a novel method for static object data association by clustering multi-modal sensor detections online (SODA-CitrON), while simultaneously estimating positions and maintaining persistent tracks for an unknown number of objects. The proposed unsupervised machine learning approach operates in a fully online manner and handles temporally uncorrelated and multi-sensor measurements. Additionally, it has a worst-case loglinear complexity in the number of sensor detections while providing full output explainability. We evaluate the proposed approach in different Monte Carlo simulation scenarios and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, including Bayesian filtering, DBSTREAM clustering, and JPDA.

To tackle the high computational cost and privacy challenges of processing large-scale distributed data with conventional neural networks, we propose an FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. Each edge device employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for lightweight local training and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model updates. The total energy consumption is minimized through a joint optimization of the HDC dimension, transmit power, and CPU frequency. An efficient hybrid algorithm is developed, combining an outer enumeration search for HDC dimensions with an inner one-dimensional search for resource allocation.

However, current models capture not only biologically relevant features, but also pre-analytic and scanner-specific variation that bias the predictions of task-specific models trained from the foundation model features. Here we show that introducing novel robustness losses during training of downstream task-specific models reduces sensitivity to technical variability. A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features.

However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance.

Our work addresses a limitation that traditional differentiable renderers are constrained to vector graphics, given that most images in the world are bitmaps. Our core contribution is a highly parallelized rendering pipeline, featuring a custom CUDA implementation for calculating gradients. This system can, for example, optimize the position, rotation, scale, color, and opacity of thousands of bitmap primitives all in under 1 min using a consumer GPU.

For such robots, interaction understanding is not primarily a fine-grained recognition problem, but a perception problem under limited sensing quality and computational resources. Many existing approaches focus on holistic group activity recognition, which often requires complex and large models which may not be necessary for mobile service robots. Others use pairwise interaction methods which commonly rely on skeletal representations but their use in outdoor environments remains challenging. In this work, we argue that pairwise human interaction constitute a minimal yet sufficient perceptual unit for robot-centric social understanding. We study the problem of identifying interacting person pairs and classifying coarse-grained interaction behaviors sufficient for downstream group-level reasoning and service robot decision-making. To this end, we adopt a two-stage framework in which candidate interacting pairs are first identified based on lightweight geometric and motion cues, and interaction types are subsequently classified using a relation network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the JRDB dataset, where it achieves sufficient accuracy with reduced computational cost and model size compared to appearance-based methods. Additional experiments on the Collective Activity Dataset and zero shot test on a lawnmower-collected dataset further illustrate the generality of the proposed framework. These results suggest that pairwise geometric and motion cues provide a practical basis for interaction perception on mobile service robot providing a promising method for integration into mobile robot navigation stacks in future work.

Experimental results demonstrate that MNAS-Unet outperforms NAS-Unet and other state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on several medical image datasets, including PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS. Furthermore, compared with NAS-Unet, MNAS-Unet reduces the architecture search budget by 54% (early stopping at 139 epochs versus 300 epochs under the same search setting), while achieving a lightweight model with only 0.6M parameters and lower GPU memory consumption, which further improves its practical applicability. These results suggest that MNAS-Unet can improve search efficiency while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy under practical resource constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "MNAS-Unet \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 MCTS \u548c NAS\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316 DownSC \u548c UpSC \u5355\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "MNAS-Unet \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e NAS-Unet \u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u9884\u7b97 54%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\uff080.6M \u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e14 GPU \u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "MNAS-Unet \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Identifying these dependencies is essential, as they underpin critical decisions and influence a range of activities throughout software development. However, this task is challenging, particularly in modern software systems, given the high volume of complex, coupled requirements. These challenges are further exacerbated by the ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) requirements and their constant change. Consequently, requirement dependency detection is often overlooked or performed manually. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in NL processing, presenting a promising avenue for requirement-related tasks. While they have shown to enhance various requirements engineering tasks, their effectiveness in identifying requirement dependencies remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce LEREDD, an LLM-based approach for automated detection of requirement dependencies that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and In-Context Learning (ICL). It is designed to identify diverse dependency types directly from NL requirements. We empirically evaluate LEREDD against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that LEREDD provides highly accurate classification of dependent and non-dependent requirements, achieving an accuracy of 0.93, and an F1 score of 0.84, with the latter averaging 0.96 for non-dependent cases. LEREDD outperforms zero-shot LLMs and baselines, particularly in detecting fine-grained dependency types, where it yields average relative gains of 94.87% and 105.41% in F1 scores for the Requires dependency over the baselines.

Standard dynamic programming evaluates the minimum number of tests in the worst case in $\\mathcal{O}(K \\cdot N^2)$ time. The previous state-of-the-art approach formulates the testable thresholds as a partial sum of binomial coefficients and applies a combinatorial search to reduce the time complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(K \\log N)$. In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete binary search over the decision tree can be bypassed entirely. By utilizing a relaxation of the binomial bounds, we compute an approximate root that tightly bounds the optimal value.

However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve.

To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution.

By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u8be6\u7ec6\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u8be6\u7ec6\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u5e76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fb9\u7f18\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fb9\u7f18\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u7f18\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8fb9\u7f18\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, evaluating these agents remains ill-posed in general code repository generation, where the lack of deterministic ground truth leads to ambiguous metrics. Code modernization via automated translation offers a more rigorous alternative by providing a fixed ground truth -- the source repository; yet existing benchmarks are limited to small-scale repositories and rely on language-specific unit tests visible to the agent, allowing test-driven overfitting.\n  We address these limitations by introducing a benchmarking framework for repository-level code modernization built on an implementation-agnostic evaluation paradigm. This framework is instantiated through RepoMod-Bench: a benchmark of 21 real-world repositories with standardized interfaces, spanning 8 programming languages. The benchmark contains 1.6M lines of code (LOC) and 11,616 tests, with repository sizes ranging from 14 to 211K LOC. By targeting repositories with standardized interfaces, we utilize an implementation-agnostic test suite to verify functional equivalence between source and target implementations. This black-box approach ensures verification remains consistent across languages, and our environment hides all test suites from agents to prevent test-driven shortcuts. Evaluating four state-of-the-art agent configurations reveals a sharp scaling collapse: average pass rates drop from 91.3% on projects under 10K LOC to 15.3% on projects exceeding 50K LOC. These results demonstrate that autonomous modernization at scale remains a significant open challenge.

This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.\n  A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.\n  We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios.

Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset.

Existing works focus on seed prioritization but still suffer from seed explosion since corpus size remains huge. We tackle this from a new perspective: corpus reduction, i.e., computing a seed corpus subset. However, corpus reduction could lead to poor seed diversity and large runtime overhead. Prior techniques like cull_queue, AFL-Cmin, and MinSet suffer from poor diversity or prohibitive overhead, making them unsuitable for high-frequency seed scheduling.\n  We propose RandSet, a novel randomized corpus reduction technique that reduces corpus size and yields diverse seed selection simultaneously with minimal overhead. Our key insight is introducing randomness into corpus reduction to enjoy two benefits of a randomized algorithm: randomized output (diverse seed selection) and low runtime cost. Specifically, we formulate corpus reduction as a set cover problem and compute a randomized subset covering all features of the entire corpus.

From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task. We leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the composition of the VLM and the pre-trained base policy, providing statistical assurances that the verifier selects the correct strategy. After collecting interventions during deployment, we employ residual learning to improve the capability of the pre-trained policy, enabling the system to learn continually but with minimal expensive human feedback. We demonstrate our framework through experiments in simulation and on hardware, showing that UPS can disentangle confident, ambiguous, and incapable scenarios and minimizes expensive user interventions compared to uncalibrated baselines and prior human- or robot-gated continual learning approaches.

While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Recently, LLM-powered code agents have shown remarkable success in resolving complex software engineering tasks, yet their application to Rust has been limited by the absence of a large-scale, repository-level benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a benchmark comprising 500 real-world, repository-level software engineering tasks from 34 diverse and popular Rust repositories. We then perform a comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench with four representative agents and four state-of-the-art LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of their capabilities and limitations in the Rust ecosystem. Our extensive study reveals that while ReAct-style agents are promising, i.e., resolving up to 21.2% of issues, they are limited by two primary challenges: comprehending repository-wide code structure and complying with Rust's strict type and trait semantics. We also find that issue reproduction is rather critical for task resolution. Inspired by these findings, we propose RUSTFORGER, a novel agentic approach that integrates an automated test environment setup with a Rust metaprogramming-driven dynamic tracing strategy to facilitate reliable issue reproduction and dynamic analysis. The evaluation shows that RUSTFORGER using Claude-Sonnet-3.7 significantly outperforms all baselines, resolving 28.6% of tasks on Rust-SWE-bench, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest baseline, and, in aggregate, uniquely solves 46 tasks that no other agent could solve across all adopted advanced LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Rust-SWE-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cdLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u89e3\u51b3Rust\u7f16\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RUSTFORGER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Rust\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u9661\u5ced\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Rust-SWE-bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b500\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684Rust\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u56db\u79cdLLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faRUSTFORGER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "RUSTFORGER\u4f7f\u7528Claude-Sonnet-3.7\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8628.6%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534734.9%\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8646\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728Rust\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0cRUSTFORGER\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Lipton and Tarjan [FOCS'77] famously proved that every planar graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$, as well as a balanced separator of size $O(D)$ that is a simple path (where $D$ is $G$'s diameter). In the centralized setting, both separators can be found in linear time. In the distributed setting, $D$ is a universal lower bound for the round complexity of solving many optimization problems, so, separators of size $O(D)$ are preferable.\n  It was not until [DISC'17] that a distributed algorithm was devised by Ghaffari and Parter to compute such an $O(D)$-size separator in $\\tilde O(D)$ rounds, by adapting the Lipton-Tarjan algorithm to the distributed model. Since then, this algorithm was used in several distributed algorithms for planar graphs, e.g., [GP, DISC'17], [LP, STOC'19], [AEDPW, PODC'25]. However, the algorithm is randomized, deeming the algorithms that use it to be randomized as well. Obtaining a deterministic algorithm remained an interesting open question until [PODC'25], when a (complex) deterministic separator algorithm was given by Jauregui, Montealegre and Rapaport.\n  We present a much simpler deterministic separator algorithm with the same (near-optimal) $\\tilde O(D)$-round complexity. While previous works devised either complicated or randomized ways of transferring weights from vertices to faces of $G$, we show that a straightforward way also works: Each vertex simply transfers its weight to one arbitrary face it lies on. That's it!\n  We note that a deterministic separator algorithm directly derandomizes the state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for classical problems on planar graphs such as single-source shortest-paths, maximum-flow, directed global min-cut, and reachability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u9694\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6216\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u9694\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9876\u70b9\u6743\u91cd\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4efb\u610f\u7684\u76f8\u90bb\u9762\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684$\tilde O(D)$\u8f6e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and directly maps visual sign gestures to semantic instructions. This design reduces annotation cost and avoids the information loss introduced by gloss representations, enabling more natural and scalable multimodal interaction.\n  In this work, we focus on a real-time alphabet-level finger-spelling interface that provides a robust and low-latency communication channel for robotic control. Compared with large-scale continuous sign language recognition, alphabet-level interaction offers improved reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility in safety-critical embodied environments. The proposed pipeline transforms continuous gesture streams into coherent language commands through geometric normalization, temporal smoothing, and lexical refinement, ensuring stable and consistent interaction.\n  Furthermore, the framework is designed to support future integration of transformer-based gloss-free sign language models, enabling scalable word-level and sentence-level semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in grounding sign-derived instructions into precise robotic actions under diverse interaction scenarios.

They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations.

These systems face the test oracle problem from multiple perspectives. On the one hand, a test oracle must be defined for each instruction prompt, which is a complex and non-generalizable approach. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art oracles typically capture symbolic representations of the world (e.g., robot and object states), enabling the correctness evaluation of a task, but fail to assess other critical aspects, such as the quality with which VLA-enabled robots perform a task. In this paper, we explore whether Metamorphic Testing (MT) can alleviate the test oracle problem in this context. To do so, we propose two metamorphic relation patterns and five metamorphic relations to assess whether changes to the test inputs impact the original trajectory of the VLA-enabled robots. An empirical study involving five VLA models, two simulated robots, and four robotic tasks shows that MT can effectively alleviate the test oracle problem by automatically detecting diverse types of failures, including, but not limited to, uncompleted tasks.

In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods.

To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging.

During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8868\u793a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5bff\u547d\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u8868\u793a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8d85\u58f0\u5fc3\u52a8\u56fe\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

We explore family routines as a critical entry point for understanding how robots might find a sustainable role in everyday family settings. Together with each of the ten families, we co-designed robot interactions and behaviors, and a plan for the robot to support their chosen routines, accounting for contextual factors such as timing, participants, locations, and the activities in the environment. We then designed, prototyped, and deployed a mobile social robot as a four-day, in-home user study. Families welcomed the robot's reminders, with parents especially appreciating the offloading of some reminding tasks. At the same time, interviews revealed tensions around timing, authority, and family dynamics, highlighting the complexity of integrating robots into households beyond the immediate task of reminders.

We integrated streaming constraints into our question answering pipeline, which is structured into two asynchronous threads: a Descriptor Thread that continuously converts video into a lightweight textual memory, and a Question Answering (QA) Thread that reasons over the textual memory to answer queries. Experiments on the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark analyze the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within strict resource boundaries, showing promising results also when compared to clound-based solutions. Specifically, an end-to-end configuration running on a consumer-grade 8GB GPU achieves 51.76% accuracy with a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 0.41s. Scaling to a local enterprise-grade server yields 54.40% accuracy with a TTFT of 0.88s. In comparison, a cloud-based solution obtains an accuracy of 56.00%.

Despite its success, existing research lacks a systematic taxonomy of SE-specific context types and a dedicated benchmark to quantify the heterogeneous effects of different contexts across core SE workflows. To address this gap, we propose CL4SE (Context Learning for Software Engineering), a comprehensive benchmark featuring a fine-grained taxonomy of four SE-oriented context types (interpretable examples, project-specific context, procedural decision-making context, and positive & negative context), each mapped to a representative task (code generation, code summarization, code review, and patch correctness assessment). We construct high-quality datasets comprising over 13,000 samples from more than 30 open-source projects and evaluate five mainstream LLMs across nine metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that context learning yields an average performance improvement of 24.7% across all tasks. Specifically, procedural context boosts code review performance by up to 33% (Qwen3-Max), mixed positive-negative context improves patch assessment by 30% (DeepSeek-V3), project-specific context increases code summarization BLEU by 14.78% (GPT-Oss-120B), and interpretable examples enhance code generation PASS@1 by 5.72% (DeepSeek-V3).

We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs' practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation.

Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality.

Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.\n  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.\n  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.\n  Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.\n  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.", "AI": {"tldr": "ArchAgent\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u654f\u6377\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "ArchAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAlphaEvolve\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "ArchAgent\u5728\u4e24\u5929\u5185\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.3%\u7684IPC\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728SPEC06\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u752818\u5929\u5c31\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.9%\u7684IPC\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.4%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ArchAgent\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eAlphaEvolve\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406AI\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

While existing DL fuzzing techniques have made progress in detecting crashes, they inherently struggle to detect silent bugs due to the lack of effective test programs and corresponding oracles.\n  Building on the observation that historical bug reports contain rich, underutilized information about silent bugs, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform versatile yet controlled bug transfer for silent bug fuzzing. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract context-aware bug patterns from historical issues, match semantically related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using functionality-based embeddings, and synthesize test cases with customized oracles. This enables proactive detection of silent bugs by transferring high-risk contexts and oracle designs from known buggy APIs to functionally similar target APIs. To ensure the reliability of our context-aware bug transfer, we introduce an LLM-powered self-validation module that systematically evaluates the validity of each transferred bug instance. We implement this methodology in a tool named TransFuzz and evaluate it on three mainstream DL libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore.

Carsickness across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator conditions", "comment": null, "summary": "Carsickness has gained significant attention with the rise of automated vehicles, prompting extensive research across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator environments to understand its occurrence and develop mitigation strategies. However, the lack of carsickness standardization complicates comparisons across studies and environments. Previous works demonstrate measurement validity between two setups at most (e.g., on-road vs. driving simulator), leaving gaps in multi-environment comparisons. This study investigates the recreation of an on-road motion sickness exposure - previously replicated on a test track - using a motion-based driving simulator. Twenty-eight participants performed an eyes-off-road non-driving task while reporting motion sickness using the Misery Scale during the experiment and the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire afterward. Psychological factors known to influence motion sickness were also assessed. The results present subjective and objective measurements for motion sickness across the considered environments. In this paper, acceleration measurements, objective metrics and subjective motion sickness ratings across environments are compared, highlighting key differences in sickness occurrence for simulator-based research validity. Significantly lower motion sickness scores are reported in the simulator compared to on-road and test-track conditions, due to its limited working envelope to reproduce low-frequency (<0.5 Hz) motions, which are the most provocative for motion sickness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u91cd\u73b0\u9053\u8def\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9053\u8def\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d5b\u9053\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7531\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u95ee\u9898\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "28\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u975e\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528Misery\u91cf\u8868\u548cMotion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire\u62a5\u544a\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u75c7\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9053\u8def\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d5b\u9053\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u91cd\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Several systems have been designed to improve shuffle efficiency, but from our experiences of running ultra-large clusters at Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute platform, we observe that they can not adapt to highly dynamic job characteristics and cluster resource conditions, and their fault tolerance mechanisms are passive and inefficient when failures are inevitable. To tackle their limitations, we design and implement FuxiShuffle as a general data shuffle service for the ultra-large production environment of MaxCompute, featuring good adaptability and efficient failure resilience. Specifically, to achieve good adaptability, FuxiShuffle dynamically selects the shuffle mode based on runtime information, conducts progress-aware scheduling for the downstream workers, and automatically determines the most suitable backup strategy for each shuffle data chunk. To make failure resilience efficient, FuxiShuffle actively ensures data availability with multi-replica failover, prevents memory overflow with careful memory management, and employs an incremental recovery mechanism that does not lose computation progress. Our experiments show that, compared to baseline systems, FuxiShuffle significantly reduces not only end-to-end job completion time but also aggregate resource consumption.

We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCR\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u51fa\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5d29\u6e83\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u71b5\u8f93\u5165\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6e90\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5230\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "SCR\u5728POPE\u548cCHAIR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86CIDEr\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "SCR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u867d\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u672a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u76d1\u7763\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4f46\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics.

First, a suitable planning model capturing the relevant aspects of the full nonlinear helicopter dynamics is derived. Next, we use the SHMPC together with a touchdown controller stage to ensure a pre-specified maneuver time and an associated landing time window despite the presence of disturbances.

Thus, given a target position and time, a safe landing with suitable terminal conditions is be guaranteed if the initial optimization problem is feasible.

At the same time, renewable energy sources regularly produce more electricity than the grid can absorb, leading to curtailment, the deliberate reduction of clean generation that would otherwise go to waste.

This technical report presents a system that performs full-parameter LLM training across geo-distributed GPU clusters during regional curtailment windows, elastically switching between local single-site training and federated multi-site synchronization as sites become available or unavailable. Our prototype trains a 561M-parameter transformer model across three clusters using the Flower federated learning framework, with curtailment periods derived from real-world marginal carbon intensity traces.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top.

However, their fine-scale architectural traits are difficult to capture with existing 3D sensing methods, which make quantitative evaluation difficult. Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS), or traditional photogrammetry approaches poorly reconstruct thin branches, dense foliage, and lack the scale consistency needed for long-term monitoring. Implicit 3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are promising alternatives, but cannot recover the true scale of a scene and lack any means to be accurately geo-localised. In this paper, we present a pipeline which fuses NeRF, LiDAR SLAM, and GNSS to enable repeatable, geo-localised ecological monitoring of saplings. Our system proposes a three-level representation: (i) coarse Earth-frame localisation using GNSS, (ii) LiDAR-based SLAM for centimetre-accurate localisation and reconstruction, and (iii) NeRF-derived object-centric dense reconstruction of individual saplings. This approach enables repeatable quantitative evaluation and long-term monitoring of sapling traits. Our experiments in forest plots in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK) and Evo (Finland) show that stem height, branching patterns, and leaf-to-wood ratios can be captured with increased accuracy as compared to TLS. We demonstrate that accurate stem skeletons and leaf distributions can be measured for saplings with heights between 0.5m and 2m in situ, giving ecologists access to richer structural and quantitative data for analysing forest dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408NeRF\u3001LiDAR SLAM\u548cGNSS\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6811\u82d7\u751f\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6811\u82d7\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u957f\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff1aGNSS\u7c97\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001LiDAR SLAM\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u3001NeRF\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u6811\u82d7\u7684\u830e\u9ad8\u3001\u5206\u679d\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u53f6\u6728\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

We propose a structured temporal joint load prediction framework oriented to microservice topology. The method represents the system as a coupled entity of a time-evolving service invocation graph and multivariate load sequences. It constructs neighborhood-aggregated and global summarized views based on service level observations. This forms layered load representations across instance, service, and cluster levels. A unified sequence encoder models multi-scale historical context. To strengthen the expression of invocation dependencies, the framework introduces a lightweight structural prior into attention computation. This enables more effective capture of load propagation and accumulation along invocation chains, while maintaining consistent modeling of local bursts and overall trends. The training objective adopts a multi-objective regression strategy that jointly optimizes service level and cluster level predictions to improve cross-granularity stability. We further conduct single-factor sensitivity analyses on key structural and training hyperparameters.

Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes.

Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

Simple heuristics for assessing workload performance, such as CPU utilization or application-level metrics, are often insufficient to capture the complex performance dynamics arising from resource contention and noisy-neighbor effects. In such environments, performance bottlenecks may emerge in any shared system resource, leading to unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose degradation.\n  This paper introduces buoyancy, a novel abstraction for characterizing workload performance in multi-tenant systems. Unlike traditional approaches, buoyancy integrates application-level metrics with system-level insights of shared resource contention to provide a holistic view of performance dynamics. By explicitly capturing bottlenecks and headroom across multiple resources, buoyancy facilitates resource-aware and application-aware orchestration in a manner that is intuitive, extensible, and generalizable across heterogeneous platforms. We evaluate buoyancy using representative multi-tenant workloads to illustrate its ability to expose performance-limiting resource interactions.

However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings.

In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model.

Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization.

Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies.

Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.\n  This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations.

Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG.

Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process.

These results are compared and discussed against the Geometric-Variable Strain approach. Subsequently, simulation results are experimentally verified by reshaping a slender rod while recording the resulting configurations using cameras. The rod configuration is imposed using a manipulator displacing one of its tips and extracted through reflective markers, without the aid of any other external sensor -- i.e. strain gauges or wrench sensors placed along the rod.

To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal parameter configurations for parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications.\n  STELLAR differs fundamentally from traditional autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR enables autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning by (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations.\n  We evaluate the impact of each component on optimization outcomes, providing design insights for similar systems in other optimization domains.

However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency.

Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence.

Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5165\u6293\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6293\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u4f5c\u5757\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u6293\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6293\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6293\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

The present bottleneck of distributed large-scale spiking neuronal network simulations is the communication between compute nodes. Communication speed seems limited by the interconnect between the nodes and the software library orchestrating the data transfer. Profiling reveals, however, that the variability of the time required by the compute nodes between communication calls is large. The bottleneck is in fact the waiting time for the slowest node. A statistical model explains total simulation time on the basis of the distribution of computation times between communication calls. A fundamental cure is to avoid communication calls because this requires fewer synchronizations and reduces the variability of computation times across compute nodes. The organization of the mammalian brain into areas lends itself to such an optimization strategy. Connections between neurons within an area have short delays, but the delays of the long-range connections across areas are an order of magnitude longer. This suggests a structure-aware mapping of areas to compute nodes allowing for a partition into more frequent communication between nodes simulating a particular area and less frequent global communication. We demonstrate a substantial performance gain on a real-world example. This work proposes a local-global hybrid communication architecture for large-scale neuronal network simulations as a first step in mapping the structure of the brain to the structure of a supercomputer. It challenges the long-standing belief that the bottleneck of simulation is synchronization inherent in the collective calls of standard communication libraries.

However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates.

For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.

However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy.

Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time.

The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406AI\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aO-RAN\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u72ec\u7acb\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76d1\u7763\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6743\u91cd\u4ee3\u7406\u3001O-RU\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8641.93%\u7684\u6d3b\u8dc3O-RU\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8692%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views.

However, they exclusively consider risk from the AV's perspective and, as such, do not address the ethicality of its decisions for other road users. We argue that this does not reduce the risk of each road user, as risk may be different from the perspective of each road user. Indeed, minimizing the risk from the AV's perspective may not imply that the risk from the perspective of other road users is also being minimized; in fact, it may even increase. To test this hypothesis, we propose an AV motion planning strategy that supports switching risk minimization strategies between all road user perspectives. We find that the risk from the perspective of other road users can generally be considered different to the risk from the AV's perspective. Taking a collective risk perspective, i.e., balancing the risks of all road users, we observe an AV that minimizes overall traffic risk the best, while putting itself at slightly higher risk for the benefit of others, which is consistent with human driving behavior. In addition, adopting a collective risk minimization strategy can also be beneficial to the AV's travel efficiency by acting assertively when other road users maintain a low risk estimate of the AV. Yet, the AV drives conservatively when its planned actions are less predictable to other road users, i.e., associated with high risk. We argue that such behavior is a form of self-reflection and a natural prerequisite for socially acceptable AV behavior. We conclude that to facilitate ethicality in road traffic that includes AVs, the risk-perspective of each road user must be considered in the decision-making of AVs.", "AI": {"tldr": "AV\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u6240\u6709\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684AV\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4eceAV\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u8003\u8651\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6240\u6709\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684AV\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u901a\u5e38\u4e0eAV\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6240\u6709\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8AV\u7684\u51fa\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AV\uff09\u7684\u9053\u8def\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6027\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5728AV\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9053\u8def\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CourtGuard\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6cbb\u7406\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CourtGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8fa9\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u5b89\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e3aAI\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The needle puncture, as the most critical step of PDT, could lead to adverse consequences such as major bleeding and posterior tracheal wall perforation if performed inaccurately. Current practices of PDT puncture are all performed manually with no navigation assistance, which leads to large position and angular errors (5 mm and 30 degree). To improve the accuracy and reduce the difficulty of the PDT procedure, we propose a system that automates the needle insertion using a velocity-controlled robotic manipulator. Guided using pose data from two electromagnetic sensors, one at the needle tip and the other inside the trachea, the robotic system uses an adaptive constrained controller to adapt the uncertain kinematic parameters online and avoid collisions with the patient's body and tissues near the target. Simulations were performed to validate the controller's implementation, and then four hundred PDT punctures were performed on a mannequin to evaluate the position and angular accuracy. The absolute median puncture position error was 1.7 mm (IQR: 1.9 mm) and midline deviation was 4.13 degree (IQR: 4.55 degree), measured by the sensor inside the trachea. The small deviations from the nominal puncture in a simulated experimental setup and formal guarantees of collision-free insertions suggest the feasibility of the robotic PDT puncture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u7684PDT\u7a7f\u523a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a7f\u523a\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPDT\u7a7f\u523a\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff085\u6beb\u7c73\u548c30\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u7ebf\u8c03\u6574\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0e\u60a3\u8005\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7a7f\u523a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a1.7\u6beb\u7c73\uff08IQR\uff1a1.9\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u7ebf\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a4.13\u5ea6\uff08IQR\uff1a4.55\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u7684PDT\u7a7f\u523a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Unlike rigid objects, deformable objects exhibit infinite dimensionality, dynamic shape changes, and complex interactions with their environment, posing significant hurdles for perception, modeling, and control. This paper reviews the state of the art in DOM, focusing on key challenges such as occlusion handling, task generalization, and scalable, real-time solutions. It highlights advancements in multimodal perception systems, including the integration of multi-camera setups, active vision, and tactile sensing, which collectively address occlusion and improve adaptability in unstructured environments. Cutting-edge developments in physically informed reinforcement learning (RL) and differentiable simulations are explored, showcasing their impact on efficiency, precision, and scalability. The review also emphasizes the potential of simulated expert demonstrations and generative neural networks to standardize task specifications and bridge the simulation-to-reality gap. Finally, future directions are proposed, including the adoption of graph neural networks for high-level decision-making and the creation of comprehensive datasets to enhance DOM's real-world applicability.

In contrast, our method is purely event-based, which relaxes restrictions for hardware implementation. We also introduce several advancements from the previous work that enable us to theoretically support and practically improve light field reconstruction from events alone. In particular, we clarify the key role of a black pattern in aperture coding patterns.

This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings.

This paper presents a low-cost, lightweight, 3D-printed robotic prosthetic hand, specifically engineered for enhanced dexterity with electronic devices such as a computer keyboard or piano, as well as general object manipulation. The robotic hand features a mechanism to adjust finger abduction/adduction spacing, a 2-D wrist with the inclusion of controlled ulnar/radial deviation optimized for typing, and control of independent finger pressing. We conducted a study to demonstrate how participants can use the robotic hand to perform keyboard typing and piano playing in real time, with different levels of finger and wrist motion.

Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios.

In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "SideQuest \u5229\u7528 LRM \u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u538b\u7f29 KV \u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf 65%\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u5360\u636e LLM \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f7f\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "SideQuest \u5c06 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7ba1\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6c61\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSideQuest \u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11 65% \u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SideQuest \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRM\uff09\u81ea\u8eab\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6709\u7528\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 KV \u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches face two key challenges: strong coupling between base and arm actions complicates whole-body control optimization, and perceptual attention is often poorly allocated as viewpoints shift during mobile manipulation. We propose InCoM, an intent-driven perception and structured coordination framework for whole-body mobile manipulation. InCoM infers latent motion intent to dynamically reweight multi-scale perceptual features, enabling stage-adaptive allocation of perceptual attention. To support robust cross-modal perception, InCoM further incorporates a geometric-semantic structured alignment mechanism that enhances multimodal correspondence. On the control side, we design a decoupled coordinated flow matching action decoder that explicitly models coordinated base-arm action generation, alleviating optimization difficulties caused by control coupling.

We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model.

However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications.

DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2026.3668184", "summary": "Occlusions present a significant challenge for connected and automated vehicles, as they can obscure critical road users from perception systems. Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture the cumulative nature of these threats over time adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel and universal risk assessment metric, the Risk of Tracking Loss (RTL), which aggregates instantaneous risk intensity throughout occluded periods. This provides a holistic risk profile that encompasses both high-intensity, short-term threats and prolonged exposure. Utilizing diverse and high-fidelity real-world datasets, a large-scale statistical analysis is conducted to characterize occlusion risk and validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The metric is applied to evaluate different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) deployment strategies. Our study shows that full V2X penetration theoretically eliminates this risk, the reduction is highly nonlinear; a substantial statistical benefit requires a high penetration threshold of 75-90%. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel asymmetric communication framework that allows even non-connected vehicles to receive warnings. Experimental results demonstrate that this paradigm achieves better risk mitigation performance. We found that our approach at 25% penetration outperforms the traditional symmetric model at 75%, and benefits saturate at only 50% penetration. This work provides a crucial risk assessment metric and a cost-effective, strategic roadmap for accelerating the safety benefits of V2X deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRTL\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u906e\u6321\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347V2X\u5b89\u5168\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4f4e\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5176\u7d2f\u79ef\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86RTL\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "RTL\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u906e\u6321\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f4e\u6e17\u900f\u7387\uff0825%\uff09\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0875%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u572850%\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RTL\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86V2X\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901fV2X\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6218\u7565\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}

Unlike prior methods that cannot synthesize missing geometry, we propose CRAG, which simultaneously generates plausible complete shapes and predicts poses for input parts.

This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy.

The Marinarium combines a fully instrumented underwater and aerial operational volume, extendable via a retractable roof for real-weather conditions, a digital twin in the SMaRCSim simulator and tight integration with a space robotics laboratory. All of these result from design choices aimed at bridging simulation, laboratory validation, and field conditions. We compare the Marinarium to similar existing infrastructures and illustrate how its design enables a set of experiments in four open research areas within field robotics. First, we exploit high-fidelity dynamics data from the tank to demonstrate the potential of learning-based system identification approaches applied to underwater vehicles. We further highlight the versatility of the multi-domain operating volume via a rendezvous mission with a heterogeneous fleet of robots across underwater, surface, and air.

We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares.

Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm.

However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($\u03b6$) and natural frequency ($\u03c9_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable \"safety valve\". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \\textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune \"stability\" and \"sensitivity\" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Knob\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u95e8\u63a7\u52a8\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e8c\u9636\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u9600\u201d\u548c\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6821\u51c6\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "method": "Knob\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7logit-level\u51f8\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\uff08Knob-ODE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684i.i.d.\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u7559\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10-C\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u9636\u63a7\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u5982\u9636\u8dc3\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u8870\u51cf\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Knob\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u95e8\u63a7\u52a8\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e8c\u9636\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u7684\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u9600\u201d\uff0c\u4f7f\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u719f\u6089\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7c7b\u6bd4\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u672a\u58f0\u79f0\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8c03\u8c10\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We compare three contact interaction modes: grasp-releasing, sliding induced by finger-grazing, and palm-rolling. These contact modes are combined with an information-theoretic exploration framework that guides subsequent sampling locations using a shape completion model. Our results show that the improved tactile sensing efficiency of finger-grazing and palm-rolling translates into faster convergence in shape reconstruction, requiring 34% fewer physical interactions while improving reconstruction accuracy by 55%.

Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK.

While simulation-based learning has enabled the development of robust assembly policies, their performance often degrades when deployed in real-world settings due to the sim-to-real gap. Conversely, real-world reinforcement learning (RL) methods avoid the sim-to-real gap, but rely heavily on human supervision and lack generalization ability to environmental changes. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a simulation-trained base policy with a real-world residual policy to efficiently adapt to real-world variations. The base policy, trained in simulation using low-level state observations and dense rewards, provides strong priors for initial behavior. The residual policy, learned in the real world using visual observations and sparse rewards, compensates for discrepancies in dynamics and sensor noise.

Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

Existing modeling approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical for complex control or reinforcement learning needed for realistic motions to emerge in robotic systems. In this work, we present a tendon-driven fish robot modeled in an efficient underwater swimmer environment using a simplified, stateless hydrodynamics formulation implemented in the widespread robotics framework MuJoCo. With just two real-world swimming trajectories, we identify five fluid parameters that allow a matching to experimental behavior and generalize across a range of actuation frequencies. We show that this stateless fluid model can generalize to unseen actuation and outperform classical analytical models such as the elongated body theory. This simulation environment runs faster than real-time and can easily enable downstream learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning for target tracking, reaching a 93% success rate. Due to the simplicity and ease of use of the model and our open-source simulation environment, our results show that even simple, stateless models -- when carefully matched to physical data -- can serve as effective digital twins for soft underwater robots, opening up new directions for scalable learning and control in aquatic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u9c7c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u6e38\u6cf3\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4f18\u96c5\u8fd0\u52a8\u5728\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MuJoCo\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u6e38\u6cf3\u8f68\u8ff9\u5373\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6d41\u4f53\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe93%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5339\u914d\u7269\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u751f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u5143\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027-\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "EGPO\u5229\u7528\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u71b5\u4ee3\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEGPO\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EGPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5230RLVR\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Often, these users control high-DoF robots through low-dimensional interfaces, such as using a 1-D sip-and-puff interface to operate a 6-DoF robotic arm. This mismatch results in having access to only a subset of control dimensions at a given time, imposing unintended and artificial constraints on robot motion. As a result, interface-limited demonstrations embed suboptimal motions that reflect interface restrictions rather than user intent. To address this, we present a trajectory reconstruction algorithm that reasons about task, environment, and interface constraints to lift demonstrations into the robot's full control space. We evaluate our approach using real-world demonstrations of ADL-inspired tasks performed via a 2-D joystick and 1-D sip-and-puff control interface, teleoperating two distinct 7-DoF robotic arms.

Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation.

To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation.

Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u533b\u751f\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u6b67\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u586b\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u533b\u751f\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3HealthBench\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u533b\u751f\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u89c4\u8303\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0881.8%\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5206\u6b67\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5448\u5012U\u578b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u533b\u751f\u5728\u660e\u663e\u597d\u6216\u574f\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u6b67\u3002\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u63aa\u8f9e\uff09\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff09\u5219\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u533b\u5b66AI\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u586b\u8865\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u53e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU.

However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval.

To address these challenges, we propose SPMamba-YOLO, a novel underwater object detection network that integrates multi-scale feature enhancement with global context modeling. Specifically, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling Enhanced Layer Aggregation Network (SPPELAN) module is introduced to strengthen multi-scale feature aggregation and expand the receptive field, while a Pyramid Split Attention (PSA) mechanism enhances feature discrimination by emphasizing informative regions and suppressing background interference. In addition, a Mamba-based state space modeling module is incorporated to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and global contextual information, thereby improving detection robustness in complex underwater environments. Extensive experiments on the URPC2022 dataset demonstrate that SPMamba-YOLO outperforms the YOLOv8n baseline by more than 4.9\\% in mAP@0.5, particularly for small and densely distributed underwater objects, while maintaining a favorable balance between detection accuracy and computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPMamba-YOLO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6c34\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u5149\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u989c\u8272\u5931\u771f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408SPPELAN\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff0cPSA\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Mamba\u6a21\u5757\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728URPC2022\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSPMamba-YOLO\u6bd4YOLOv8n\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578bmAP@0.5\u63d0\u53474.9%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SPMamba-YOLO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6c34\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings.

To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings.

Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency.

We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint.

However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions.

Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction.

However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data.

However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model.

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration.

However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels.

However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration.

Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference.

We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene.

Mechanistic interpretability pursues this goal by identifying circuits - minimal subnetworks responsible for specific behaviors. However, existing circuit discovery methods are brittle: circuits depend strongly on the chosen concept dataset and often fail to transfer out-of-distribution, raising doubts whether they capture concept or dataset-specific artifacts. We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept.

Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProjFlow \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u6ee1\u8db3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u52a8\u4f5c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5e38\u5e38\u7834\u574f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002ProjFlow \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ProjFlow \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProjFlow \u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u548c 2D \u5230 3D \u63d0\u5347\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ProjFlow \u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u3002"}}

We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]).

Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features.

This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer.

Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation.

While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization.

The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions.

An AI version of \"Lord of the Flies\" arises in which controlling tribes emerge with their own collective character and identity. The LLM agents do not reduce overload or improve resource use, and often perform worse than if they were flipping coins to make decisions.

However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance.

This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation.

However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FaceTT \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u6362\u65f6\u3002FaceTT \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FaceTT \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement \u7b56\u7565\u3001Tuning-free Angular Inversion \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c Adaptive Attention Control \u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFaceTT \u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u6362\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FaceTT \u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684 Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement\u3001Tuning-free Angular Inversion \u548c Adaptive Attention Control \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $\u03b3$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hat\u03b3 \\approx \u03b3$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models.

However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference.

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u2019\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08UMM\uff09\u5728\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u2018\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u2019\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165CoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08UMM\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u2019\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e00\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u2019\uff08\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7CoW-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u571f\u58e4\u6210\u5206\u548cUSDA\u8d28\u5730\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u9897\u7c92\u5927\u5c0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u611f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5e38\u89c4\u7530\u95f4\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\uff08MSI\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ecf\u571f\u3001\u7c89\u7802\u548c\u7802\u7684\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4bUSDA\u8d28\u5730\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6210\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dR^2\u9ad8\u8fbe0.99\uff0c\u8d28\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002", "conclusion": "MSI\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u8d28\u5730\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5ca9\u571f\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u519c\u4e1a\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment.

Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content.

Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions.

This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok.

However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\\pm 35^\\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU.

In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SC-ARENA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u62bd\u8c61\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8131\u79bb\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cSC-ARENA\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SC-ARENA\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u7ec6\u80de\u62bd\u8c61\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5747\uff0cSC-ARENA\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SC-ARENA\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684LLMs\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce and study a new problem, Semi-Supervised Multimodal Domain Generalization (SSMDG), which aims to learn robust multimodal models from multi-source data with few labeled samples. We observe that existing approaches fail to address this setting effectively: multimodal domain generalization methods cannot exploit unlabeled data, semi-supervised multimodal learning methods ignore domain shifts, and semi-supervised domain generalization methods are confined to single-modality inputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework featuring three key components: Consensus-Driven Consistency Regularization, which obtains reliable pseudo-labels through confident fused-unimodal consensus; Disagreement-Aware Regularization, which effectively utilizes ambiguous non-consensus samples; and Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment, which enforces domain- and modality-invariant representations while promoting robustness under missing modalities via cross-modal translation.

Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged.

Under journal review", "summary": "AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89c4\u8303\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fRLHF\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982RLHF\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e0d\u53ef\u901a\u7ea6\u6027\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RLHF\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u662f\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u65e0\u6cd5\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u800c\u975e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real\" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems.

In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process.

Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains.

Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff08DRA\uff09\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff08DRA\uff09\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0b\uff0cDRA\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DRA\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9DRA\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u968f\u673a\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5bf9DRA\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5728DeepSearchQA\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u968f\u673a\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8622%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\uff08DRA\uff09\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e22%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932).

To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "CXReasonAgent\u6574\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfLVLMs\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u54cd\u5e94\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CXReasonAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "CXReasonAgent\u572812\u4e2a\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u76841,946\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eLVLMs\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "CXReasonAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR.

This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality.

Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning.

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance.

Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

Existing methods predominantly employ optical flow-based image warping. However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve.

Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a \"retrieve-verify-refine\" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios.

Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects.

Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions.

To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.\n  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames.

We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel \"Align then Adapt\" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \\% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \\%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\\% on 4D semantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPointATA\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b33D\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u52304D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u77634D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5c063D\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u52304D\u4efb\u52a1\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u2018Align then Adapt\u2019\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u53163D\u4e0e4D\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5d4c\u5165\u5668\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u70b9\u89c6\u9891\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PointATA\u57283D\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u30014D\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u548c4D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "PointATA\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u52304D\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}}

Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u663e\u5fae\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u7b7e\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u533a\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u7ec6\u80de\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08CytoNet\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u572857\u4e2a\u8111\u533a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u672a\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8865\u4e01\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ec6\u80de\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u8003\u6807\u7b7e\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a90.6%\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u63a9\u7801\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u533a\u5206\u6027\u8db3\u4ee5\u57288\u9879\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4ee568.6%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6062\u590d\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f31\u6807\u7b7e\u914d\u5bf9\u8db3\u4ee5\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u914d\u5bf9\u6ce8\u91ca\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance.

Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder.

Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset.

To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories.

Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods.

Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates.

While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters.

For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use.

To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods.

We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions.

To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies.

Methods like quantization-aware training and post-training quantization strive to maintain the downstream performance of compressed models compared to the full precision models. However, these techniques do not explicitly consider the impact on algorithmic fairness. In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT.

At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation.

However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos.

However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations.

We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches.

Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieTeller \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa MovieTeller \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u751f\u6210\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMovieTeller \u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieTeller \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation.

Project website at https://circle-lmm.github.io/", "summary": "Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their \"in-context\" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task.

To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself.

It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale.

We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.", "AI": {"tldr": "SeeThrough3D\u901a\u8fc7\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u57283D\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SeeThrough3D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff08OSCR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u900f\u660e3D\u76d2\u5b50\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6e32\u67d3\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u906e\u6321\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "SeeThrough3D\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u76843D\u5e03\u5c40\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SeeThrough3D effectively\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5e03\u5c40\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OSCR\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility.

Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections.

However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2).

However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faART-STVG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709STVG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u8de8\u5ea6\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff08ART-STVG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6269\u5c55\u7684LF-STVG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cART-STVG\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ART-STVG \u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "ManifoldGD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u5f62\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faManifoldGD\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6838\u5fc3\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cManifoldGD\u5728FID\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ManifoldGD\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification.

While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU.

Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation.

MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.
